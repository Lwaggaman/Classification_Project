It is the story of abandonment and loss and learning to deal with it. It is the story of love, intense to the extreme with the generous helping of teen angst. In short, it is an excellent example of a good quality YA book, emotional, intense, and lyrical.\"I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\"Here's a short spoiler-free synopsis: Taylor Markham was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is now 17, living in Jellicoe School, a boarding school full of state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House (50 girls) and is expected to lead a sixteen-year-old 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids, the 'Townies' and the Cadets who camp out in the area for a couple of months each year. All while having strange dreams and feeling abandoned by her caretaker Hannah. All while reading Hannah's unfinished novel about five teenagers in the 1980s who form very intense friendship bonds after the horrific car accident on Jellicoe Road when they were 11-12 years old.Now, I have to say that not once did I look at this book as a mystery even though it's marketed as such. The central mystery of the story - well, I easily figured it out only a few chapters in, and the rest of the details easily came into light as the story developed. Not much took me by surprise; it was quite predictable, actually. But since the mystery was not why I enjoyed the story, the reading experience was perfectly fine. To use the book's own language, the whole mystery setup was not a trip but a journey. It was never about the resolution but about the emotional journey it took to get there.\"I remember asking, \"What is the difference between a trip and a journey?\" and my father said, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,\" and that was the last thing he ever said.\"What I loved was the friendships that the 'old five' and the 'new five' have developed throughout the course of their respective stories. My favorite by far was between Taylor and Raffaela, with the developing friendship with annoying but adorable Jessa as a close second. Even though there was a romantic story threatening to take the foreground, it never overshadowed the rest of the story and the friendships, and I'm thankful for that.\"This is the best night of my life,\" Raffy says, crying.\"Raffy, half our House has burnt down,\" I say wearily. \"We don't have a kitchen.\"\"Why do you always have to be so pessimistic?\" she asks. \"We can double up in our rooms and have a barbecue every night like the Cadets.\"Silently I vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of my life.\" I was quite emotionally affected (I'd say 'manipulated' if not for the negative connotation of that word) by the nostalgic atmosphere Marchetta creates here. The nostalgia for the beauty of childhood and adolescence, for the friendships of the kind that you can only have before you reach adulthood, for the safety of childhood (no matter how messed up it can be), for the safe haven of Jellicoe School for the lost and messed up children. I also loved Marchetta's excellent characterization. Her characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, and feel quite real. That is not to say that there's no stereotyping or clich\u00e9s, but those are kept to the minimum.\"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\"As for the voice of the novel - it is very emotional. Please be warned - it is emotional with the generous helping of teen angst. Oh, teen angst! It's on every page, in every sentence - just like it was so overwhelming when you were 16-17. Everything is intense, the tension is palpable, emotions are right on the surface. Reading this book is like experiencing being a teenager you once were. I found it to be a bit of eye-rolling experience initially (thankfully, I'm way out of the adolescence) but eventually the style grew on me and started to feel quite organic. But if you'd rather not deal with overexaggerrated raw teenage emotions - well, be warned and stay away from this story. \"What do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.\"------------------------------Now, here are the issues that I had with this book that forced me to knock off a star:- The Territory wars. I thought that storyline was limping on both feet. Why all the intensity if the whole thing only takes place for about 2 months each year? Why the whole issue with the Club House when it's only a few weeks when it becomes relevant? Honestly, just setting up a rivalry between the 'factions' would have been enough for the story. (view spoiler)[Especially since about halfway through the story any of that territory stuff becomes completely irrelevant as nobody pays any attention to it anymore (hide spoiler)].- Sometimes the emotional intensity slips into a blatant melodrama. I mean, there was actually a remark on (view spoiler)[how intense Taylor and Jonah's relationship was, which made me feel like I'm reading a Twilight-type love story (hide spoiler)].- The adults in this book (even Taylor remarks on it!). Seriously, what the hell is going on with the adults? (view spoiler)[Hannah and Jude, I'm looking at you! You and your minimal interference into the lives of the children of your best friends! And what's with keeping the parentage of Jessa and Taylor secret? Especially Taylor? I know Hannah promised Tate to not 'mother' Taylor, but what exactly was the reason why she could not tell the abandoned girl that she, Hannah, is her paternal aunt? How would it have hurt Taylor to know that????? (hide spoiler)]- Taylor and Jonah: (view spoiler)[unprotected sex? Not cool. I'm a gynecologist, and I pay attention to these things, and neither Taylor nor Jonah seem to be at the point in their lives when they seem ready to have a kid - which can happen. STDs are also not cool, you know? Chlamydia is not a joke! I wish Melina Marchetta included a condom-buying scene. It may dampen the mood, but would have provided protection and a nod of approval from this Ob/Gyn doc. (hide spoiler)]And yet, despite my adulthood, despite a few eye-rolls, despite the issues that I describe above, I STILL teared up at the end. I think admitting that will TOTALLY ruin my street cred, but oh well. All the above taken into consideration, 4 easy stars. \"And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.

And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall. It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that's objectively wrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:\"What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids?

Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d\nHere's the secret recipe to open my floodgates. Treat with care.Hand me a contemporary written by Marchetta, and I'll turn into a tsunami of tears.This review is not going to be as extensive as my usual ones, but please be so kind to check out my co-blogger Chantal's lovely review on our blog \nEvery Word A Doorway\n.I've avoided On the Jellicoe Road for years tbh. Probably because I had loved Saving Francesca so much in my youth and was scared that no other Marchetta book would ever compare. Finnikin of the Rock certainly couldn't, and I strongly believe Marchetta was born to be a realistic fiction writer, not a creator of fantasy worlds. So then I was at my local book store last winter and Chantal all but forced me to buy this. My history of avoiding this book continued, however, as it sat lonely and misplaced on my shelf. Last week, I finally decided to pick it up. Which brings us to the sobfest that is my broken self after reading this book. \nSaving Francesca\n is still closer to my heart, mainly due to its topics, but On the Jellicoe Road felt quite similar in style with its troubled main character, witty side protagonists, brooding love interest, school setting, and the serious issues it tackles. I adored the characters, especially the main character, as much as I enjoyed the dark humour from the first person POV from which the story was told. Compared to Saving Francesca, this book has a touch of mystery, as snippets of a manuscript appear between chapters, slowly unravelling along with the main character's personal storyline. Marchetta also never sugarcoats a first and/or young love which I value in a genre full of unicorns and rainbows. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because the beginning is too abrupt a start. The first chapter was both confusing and unnerving, making me wonder whether I wanted to continue, and it took me quite some time go become invested in the story thereafter. A smoother introduction would've been required. Besides shattering my heart and then glueing the pieces together again, On the Jellicoe Road brought on a massive flood of nostalgic childhood memories from Australia. Have your characters call a stroll in nature a 'bushwalk', their nightgowns a 'nightie' and each other 'mate', and I'll be a little curled up ball of homesickness. Can I just spread the love for these little shits who warmed my heart? \n\"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs.\" Anson Choi feigns surprise. \"What's her name?\"\"I didn't actually catch her name,\" Griggs continues.\"Lily,\" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look.\"Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.\"\"It's Taylor's middle name,\" Raffaela calls back again.Placing Raffaela in the path of an oncoming car becomes one of the major priorities of the next ten seconds of my life.\nWith their hysterical fits and unexpected violent outbursts coming from gentle characters? \n\"Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\"\nOn the Jellicoe Road is a beautiful book that will move you, grip you, and enchant you with fleshed out characters, an air of mystery, and a touching story. For those of you who enjoyed this book but haven't picked up any other books by Melina Marchetta, I highly recommend Saving Francesca.", "num_likes": 43, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["realistic-fiction", "2016-faves", "mental-health"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1026178432", "review_id": "1026178432", "date": "Aug 13, 2014", "rating": 4, "user_name": "\u265bTash", "user_url": "/user/show/5451856-tash", "text": "Review also on\n\nI thought about Kintsukoroi long after I read On The Jellicoe Road. You know Kintsukoroi, the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer. Making the piece more beautiful for having been broken. I am not usually given in to melodramatics but this beautiful book evoked a riot of feelings in my ice-box of a heart.On The Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham overlapping with that of another mysterious narrator whose point of view is in italic.Taylor Markham is a leader of one of the houses at the Jellicoe School, her history is riddled with more questions than answers. Unanchored to anyone, or to anything, she feels lost, an outsider to her own story looking in.\u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201dShe craves history, and Hannah, her only link to the past, had disappeared without a word. In her quest to find Hannah, with a jumbled and unfinished manuscript as her only clue, Taylor inadvertently comes to grips with the pain of her mother's abandonment and fleeting memories of being loved. While Taylor is finally confronting her past, she is also leading the Jellicoe School in territory wars against the Townie and the Cadets. The Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a boy whom Taylor spent a few eventful days with years ago.I am not fond of young adult books dealing with difficult topics because the teenage angst and drama irk me off, but On The Jellicoe Road is the exception. Of course, with the topics explored in this book, some angst and drama are inevitable, but Melina Marchetta is never heavy handed with them. She writes emotions on levels we, or at least I, understand.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.\u201dShe can pack one hell of a left hook right in the solar plexus with a single word, a testament of her compelling, lyrical writing. Damn you, Marchetta.The characters are terrific, they are raw, layered and relatable. I wanted to hang-out with Taylor, Jonah, Raffy and Santangelo in the tree-house. I still do, honestly. Taylor is especially complicated. Who wouldn't be, given her situation. The most remarkable thing about Taylor and her narrative is the air of pragmatic self-destructiveness. Like she is always on the verge of spiraling down.\u201cI do keep him at the back of my mind for those times I get me hopes raised about something. So then I can slap myself into reality and remind myself of what happens when you let someone into your sacred space.\u201d...but yeah, read the book if she truly does.The plot ties up neatly in the end and I am more than satisfied with the ending, but it takes some patience to get to the ending. You see, like Kintsukoroi, On The Jellicoe Road starts with broken pieces or fragments of a life, of a story, that may not make sense at first but as the the novel progresses, the pieces will fit and by the end you'll have yourself a beautiful whole story. So do yourself a favor and just let yourself be lost in this gem of a book,don't even back-track. I promise, it pays off in the end.On The Jellicoe Road is a story of friendship, love, forgiveness and grief. It's so much more, but I'll end it at that. I did not cry but that's more on my damaged tear ducts than the book,but okay fine, I admit, it also kind of, well, broke me. Yet somehow I am filled with hope for the characters in the book and for the young adult genre.

Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d  This was almost a star lower, except for the fact that I could not stop thinking about this book after reading it. That's the mark of a great story.When Taylor is eleven her mother abandons her. At the age of fourteen her only friend betrays her. At the age of seventeen she is selected to be the leader of her school in the annual territory wars versus the Townies and the Cadets. Her mentor Hannah has gone missing leaving Taylor feeling incredibly alone.First off, I want to say I am still a bit conflicted about my rating for one reason. When I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down. But when I put it down.... it remained down until I made myself pick it back up. In the end I binge read the last 200 pages which were excellent. But the confusing beginning definitely took away from the book as a whole. And with the italicized portions, I have a hard time connecting with characters that are from a different perspective unless I know why they matter. Luckily, I knew it would come in, but as a bad reader, I usually skip those parts and I'm glad I didn't.  \u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d  Taylor was such an amazing complex character. She was indecisive but not in an annoying way. It was understandable with all of the shit she went through in her life that it would be difficult to trust and love others for her. Once everything came together in the end, it was easy to see why she was so messed up.But the best part for me? Frickin Jonah Griggs. That boy stole my heart more than once, and his tragic story made my heart bleed for him. He was another character that ended up developing really well by the end and I kind of wish there was another book just so we know his future (not that it's a mystery at the end, it's just open).   \"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201d   Third best character was Jude. I'd also like a prequel novel giving more detail on him, Narnie, Webb and the others. I felt like there was so much more we as a reader didn't know. So overall I enjoyed this book. I didn't love it, but I can recognize that it's among the better teen literature out there in the world. This is one of those books that doesn't assume the reader is stupid. It is what it is, and you either enjoy it or you don't.  \u201cMaybe memories should be left the way they are.\u201d  ", "num_likes": 37, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult", "ya-contemporary-romance", "paperback"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1235925039", "review_id": "1235925039", "date": "Mar 24, 2015", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Denisse", "user_url": "/user/show/8759700-denisse", "text": "This is a sweet story.

It is not a mystery masterpiece and I did see some of the plot twists coming, but by then I was really into Taylor\u2019s life so it didn\u2019t bother me much.

Y solo para lectores pacientes. Por mucho rato, casi la mitad del libro, no vas a saber ni que onda con nada. No sabes que tan en serio es la parte de guerras en las \u201cguerras territoriales\u201d que se hacen en Jellicoe. Y entre eso, las alucinaciones/sue\u00f1os que tiene la protagonista Taylor y los pasajes de los 5 ni\u00f1os que se conocieron ah\u00ed antes de que ella llegara, puede revolver un poco. El libro seria una gran relectura, de hecho.Pero por eso mismo, me pique con la historia. El no saber es algo que me puede mucho. As\u00ed que no solt\u00e9 el libro, casi. Bueno, el kindle whatever. La forma de escribir es lo m\u00e1s interesante, se lee de forma bastante \u00edntima. Muy absorbente, emotiva y divertida cuando era necesario. La autora recurre mucho al mostrar y no decir. En muy pocas ocasiones te toparas con cosas como \u201cTAL persona es en realidad TAL persona\u201d o \u201cTal persona, en realidad si hizo esta TAL cosa\u201d  En lo personal me gusta pero no creo que para un YA sea lo adecuado, o sea no me imagino a alguien de 13-14 a\u00f1os leyendo esto y captando todo lo que haya que captar. Aunque siempre hay excepciones. Lo que me hace no darle las 5 es lo de siempre yo creo. Esto de Ficci\u00f3n realista o Libros contempor\u00e1neos, o como quieras llamarle, no es lo m\u00edo. Nunca puedo hacer clic enteramente. Aunque hay misterio, no es lo fuerte del libro la verdad, esta bastante est\u00e1ndar pero la autora hace un gran trabajo de camuflaje con todo lo dem\u00e1s y se te van algunas cosas que al final podr\u00edas considerar algo obvias. Solo dos cositas si las vi venir, todo lo del Ermita\u00f1o y el Brigadier. Y aunque todos los personajes est\u00e1n muy bien trabajados no conecto totalmente con ellos. Chaz y Raffy fueron mis favoritos, comoquiera. <3Muy recomendado si quieres algo que se sienta ligero pero tenga mucha mas sustancia de lo que aparenta. Y si estas de \u00e1nimos para una lectura con desarrollo lento. Yo se que la mayor\u00eda tira el libro por la ventana si no hay alg\u00fan giro intenso en las primeras 50 paginas, pero simplemente ese no es mi caso. Espero no enfadar a nadie con esto (y si lo hice, ni modo) pero los nuevos libros est\u00e1n mal acostumbrando mucho a los lectores. Tiene que haber acci\u00f3n TODO el maldito libro, o un mont\u00f3n de chistes estupidos para no aburrirlos y me pone de malas. Raz\u00f3n por la cual ya no considero la frase \u201ctiene mucha acci\u00f3n\u201d como algo positivo, solo como algo extra. Y raz\u00f3n por la cual la frase \u201ctiene un inicio lento\u201d ya no me asusta.Y Marchetta hace eso. Se toma su tiempo. Para todo. Y vale la pena la espera. PD: Que dices?

Essentially, I ought to have by now given that I'm Australian. Yeah, it's strange that I haven't read many or any.Okay, now the actual review. \"It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.\"On the Jellicoe road is about Taylor Lily Markham, who at the age of 11 was abandoned by her mother at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe road. Her only memory of her previous life is standing on her father\u2019s shoulder. Hannah is her only guardian who lives in the unfinished house by the river, and writes stories about five kids who lived there back in the 1980s. Taylor is a part of territory war between the cadets (Sydney boys who come for training every six weeks a year) and the townies (kids from Jellicoe town).The beginning was faintly confusing, but after 100 pages I finally put some of the pieces together. I won\u2019t go into the minor confusion I had experienced in the book, because I believe on the Jellicoe road should be read without much information of the backstory. It will take some time until you start understanding what\u2019s going on, nonetheless you will have an enjoyable time attempting to solve the mystery as you\u2019re reading, right before you start crying at the end. After 200 pages the book does become immensely predictable, however it wasn\u2019t any less entertaining. I\u2019m not certain if I liked Taylor. At times I despised her, and felt her i-don\u2019t-give-a-shit attitude should not simply be excused considering her tough past. At the end I worked out my conflicted feelings with Taylor and saw her in a more of a positive light. The love interest - Jonah Griggs is the leader of the cadets, and is viewed frequently as the \u2018dark and tortured\u2019 type. Taylor and Jonah have this heartbreaking and complicated history. There was no insta-love or drooling over each other like crazy in their relationship, thankfully. Anyway, I gladly recommend this book to everyone.

What a gem of a book!It's a very emotional story and at times painful to read because you see these characters that are good people make horrible decisions and become so lost that they don't even know who they are anymore. It's a story about loss, lonliness, death and guilt and all you wish for is that the characters get the happy ending they deserve.Melina Marchetta's writing is superb; she uses metaphors and similes in a way that is never jarring and really creates atmosphere. After reading On the Jellicoe Road I immidiatly want to pick up Marchetta's other books because this novel has instilled a kind of trust in me. I feel like I would love whatever she writes. The way she deals with such serious topics and still manages to make me laugh with her dry humour and sarcasm is fantastic. I loved the characters in this story. Taylor, our protagonist, is a 17-year-old girl who has been abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven. Since then, she hasn't seen her mother or father and feels like she can't trust anyone and that nobody in the world loves her. I feel like characters such as Taylor are very difficult to write because they can be very moody, depressed and even mean at times and yet they still have to be lovable. Melina Marchetta did a great job with this, I really empathized with Taylor and her witty remarks just added another layer to the story. I also loved Rafi and Ben, Taylor's best friends and completely fell in love with Jonah. This book really is full of complex, likeable characters. The reason I took away half a star was because the novel was quite confusing at times. Particularly at the beginning, it took me a while to understand what was going on, who these characters were, what was past and what was present. Getting through these first pages totally paid off though.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes contemporary.

Where to start with a book like this? The first half is odd and so confusing. You understand the gist that there's a territory war going on between the residents of Jellicoe Road and they're split into three factions; the Townies, the Cadets, and the students of the Jellicoe School. Of course, enter our main cast, which is a mix of all three and you can see how this would be fun and entertaining. But this book doesn't stop there; there's also flashbacks to a group a generation before who suffered death through a huge car accident on Jellicoe Road. These flashbacks are vague in the beginning, but slowly gain clarity until the image is too heartbreaking and clear.Both groups are riddled with traumas and sadness. The main character, Taylor, was left at a 7-11 at eleven years old. The generation before suffered the death of most of their families in a huge car accident. Every character in this novel has a purpose, problems, and a personality all their own. It's so hard to not give legions of spoilers right now, but I'll resist the temptation so that those who haven't read this can be encouraged to do so.Marchetta's writing is unique to say the least. It's interesting, but oh so exiguous. By the end of the book, you still have no idea of eye colors, hair colors, and for some characters, you know absolutely nothing of how they look, just their typical facial expressions and maybe some body language.This was both great and frustrating. I appreciate her different way of approaching description since I created the images of the characters in my own mind, and even if they look the opposite of how I'm picturing them, I would still know them just by their walk or the way they crinkle their nose. I don't know; maybe my mild OCD is why the whole no general description drove me bonkers. That's my only complaint, and that's not even a real problem since I don't actually mind as much now that I've finished it. :)The final thing I wanted to praise was a parallel Marchetta hid in here. I loved that she did it, and adored how she presented it. (view spoiler)[(When Taylor saw Sam and thought about how she could have turned out the same way had her mother not \"given\" her to Hannah. I was so depressed I ate a whole bag of Haribo.) (hide spoiler)]All I can say is read this book. Especially if you enjoy books taking place in private schools, small towns, or Australia. Or contemporary YA, modern classics, novels with a darker tone, or books that will keep you guessing.

What to say about this book...I've put off writing this review, because I don't really know how to describe it in a coherant fashion. For the first 150 pages or so, I was absolutely lost. I contemplated giving up several times and could not keep up with how disjointed this story was. Melina Marchetta wasted absolutely no time diving right into the guts of the plotline, offering exceedingly little explanation. At times, I felt like I was nodding along with a conversation about quantum physics or (cringe) politics, while posses no prior knowledge of the subject. Thank God my GR friends encouraged me to keep on reading. Marchetta is a beautiful, poetic writer. There are so many quotes within this novel that I want to write down in a notebook and keep with me at all times, or have tattooed somewhere discreet. They're that profound. She nailed the complexity aspect of this novel. I did need some further discussion and explanation following my completion of the book, so I could make sure that I actually understood what happened, but once I was clued into each detail, I was blown away. There are so many different interwoven layers within Jellicoe Road. I highly suggest, at the advice of Alexa, to keep a sheet of paper with you and write the characters names down in order to keep them straight. This might sound silly, but it would've helped me so much more if I'd have done this! Taylor Markham is a fantastic female lead. She is independent and loyal. She has a bit of a temper, but that just makes her colorful. I thought at the beginning that she was kind of frigid towards some of the girls within her House, but she can't help it. Taylor had so much love and affection within herself, but came off emotionally constipated, likely due to her tragic past and difficulty with those close to her. I loved, loved, LOVED the progression of the relationship between Jonah and Taylor. Jonah is so incredibly romantic <3 I will definitely go back and re-read some of his lines whenever I need a good swoon. I loved them because there was an underlying affection, even though both of them were supposed to be die-hard enemies. The two fit so perfectly together, like some heart-shaped puzzle piece (so corny, I know. It's late.) I want more of these two, yet I'm 100% satisfied with their situation and how the story ended. The story of Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Webb, and Jude is a heartbreaking one. Again, I can't say much about these five without giving away a rather significant portion of the story, but this bunch claimed my heart and ran with it. Jellicoe Road and all of its characters were filled with this all-encompassing love for one another, that I could feel my heart swelling even though I had tears streaking down my face. I don't think I've ever read so many characters that possessed such selfless, genuine love for one another. And the best part? It wasn't cheesy at all. It felt real. You know what else felt real? The angst. The heartbreak. The losses. And there's quite a bit of each category in this one. Be prepared. Surround yourself with a few boxes of Kleenex. I will definitely be reading more of Marchetta's work in the future, but am slightly intimidated that all her stories will be as complex as this one. Truly, though, her writing is so wonderful that the brain-busting will be worth it.

But here is what happened; I didn\u2019t understand what was going on in the book until I was in the middle of it. I even thought of abandoning the book but the writing was beautiful and kept me going. And when it started making sense, it was worth all the chaos. Things that I loved:As I mentioned earlier Jellicoe Road is definitely tough to get into but Melina Marchetta\u2019s writing will suck into this strange world where kids learn to protect theirs and take over others\u2019 land. I loved that all the characters had multiple layers and a deeper story. I loved that even before I understood the plot I got deeply invested into the lives of these kids that I couldn\u2019t stop reading.I am totally in love with the kids from 80s in the manuscript.The characters in Jellicoe Road deal with death, grief, abandonment, drugs addiction and suicide and I am sure for a Young Adult book this is too heavy. I am still confused whether to tag this one as Young Adult or contemporary or even a mystery. Things that didn\u2019t work for me:I am finally getting used to not searching for responsible adults in YA and you wouldn\u2019t find them in Jellicoe Road. And I am not gonna lie, it did feel like it took ages to understand who they were and what happened to them. Though I kinda guessed it about three-fourth into the story, but I am not going to complain. While I am happy at how things turned out for the three factions, I also am kinda annoyed that the story took huge diversion from that part of the story. There were times when the teenage angst and the whiny female lead got to me, but I am glad I chose to eye-roll and ignore them.

You have:-this school battle that sounds like it may be dystopian or apocalyptic (it's not) so you're trying unnecessarily to figure out this new world (and those of us who aren't Australian trying to figure out the school grade system).-you are introduced to all the characters right off the bat from all the houses at the boarding school plus cadets and townies and how they all relate together. I was worse than lost those first few chapters.-the story is periodically interrupted with italicized inserts of a whole new cast of characters you're not sure how they relate to the story or each other.-Taylor has vague dreams that don't make sense, plus a history of being abandoned by her mother that you know you're not getting the full story about.-Hannah has her own history she's not sharing and you can't quite figure out her relationship to Taylor or the school.-and a prologue from twenty years before (a beautiful introduction by the way), which I got later was related to the characters in the italicized inserts (duh, it's the same names) which made them so much more interesting once they had a foundation, but when everything was dumped on me at once, it took a good hundred pages before I wasn't confused at what characters were in what scenes and how everything related together and even half the time what was happening.The only things that kept me going were A) my own stubbornness (because this book has gotten such rave reviews and I was bound and determined to find out why) and B) Griggs.

I honestly don't know if I would have finished the book if it weren't for him, which is a shame because by midway, I was so caught up in Taylor's story, I finished it in a day. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I know if I went back and reread the book, it would be so much more poignant the second time around, but I'd rather have been caught up in the first time instead of being so frustrated.Once I understood all that Taylor is protecting inside, I wanted to protect her and help her along this journey to discover why she was abandoned by her mother years ago. I loved her relationships and some of the dialogue and in the end I cried for her. All the characters are endearing. It's that powerful and beautiful and tragic. And the ending is perfect.

It took a good \u00bc to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I\u2019m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn\u2019t be rereading this book in the near future, about \u00be the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy.

A autora espalha as pe\u00e7as sobre a mesa e deixa que o leitor tente encaix\u00e1-las sozinho por um tempo antes de come\u00e7ar a jornada guiada.A hist\u00f3ria acompanha a vida de Taylor, menina de 17 anos que foi abandonada quando mais nova, e agora estuda em um internato. H\u00e1 dois conflitos que movem Taylor:- O passado: Ela n\u00e3o sabe quem \u00e9 seu pai e desconhece o paradeiro da m\u00e3e, e quer preencher essa lacuna da sua vida a todo custo, embora nenhum dos mais velhos a ajude com pistas ou informa\u00e7\u00f5es.- O presente: Taylor est\u00e1 assumindo o \"comando\" de uma das casas do internato bem na \u00e9poca em que come\u00e7a uma tradicional disputa territorial da regi\u00e3o. As meninas do orfanato, os citadinos - moradores da cidade, e cadetes que acampam por ali nessa \u00e9poca se enfrentam em um jogo de regras definidas que coloca os 3 grupos sempre em situa\u00e7\u00f5es delicadas.Al\u00e9m de se revezar entre esses dois conflitos, tentando nos ambientar com a brincadeira, a autora conta duas outras hist\u00f3rias, mais curtas por\u00e9m importantes:- Sonhos: Taylor tem sempre um sonho estranho. Um garoto no alto de uma \u00e1rvore que vem falar com ela. Os sonhos a deixam perturbada com alguma frequ\u00eancia.- Livro: A mulher que cuida de Taylor est\u00e1 escrevendo um livro, uma hist\u00f3ria com menos disputas territoriais e mais amizade. Sempre que Taylor pode, ela rouba algumas p\u00e1ginas para ler. Um livro quebra-cabe\u00e7a, um livro de hist\u00f3rias dentro de hist\u00f3rias, exige mais do leitor. N\u00e3o tem jeito.

E do meio em diante, voc\u00ea vai notar que o ritmo de leitura aumentar\u00e1 consideravelmente. Saindo um pouco das tramas, vale dizer que o ponto forte s\u00e3o os personagens incrivelmente reais. Tanto os amigos de Taylor quanto os rivais parecem gente de verdade com quem conversamos no dia a dia.

All the teens take the rules and territories with utmost seriousness, the way teens do. This premise was a bit confusing to me as a reader at times, because it was hard to visualize some of the landscape (and do Cadets always live in tents?)Taylor's Mom abandoned her when she was 11, and she's lived at the school ever since (so here's the YA orphanish trope) but she's been looked after by a woman living at the school named Hannah. Hannah has her own book about a group of teenaged friends that Taylor starts to read, and it starts playing an even more important part in the story. And then Hannah disappears.And then there are serial killers and mysterious brigadiers and drug addicts and prostitutes.I felt it was a little uneven in the storytelling, to the extent that some of the characters lacked a certain realism.

I forced myself to finish it and you should never feel that way about a five star book so here's a review, eyes wide open.Jellicoe Road tells two stories, separated by decades, and neither of them was initially compelling for me. The story the highly quotable opening lines come from the first, older story. The first story set events in motion that the second story relies on. Unfortunately Melina Marchetta tells the first story like an asshole. I'm sorry, I tried to think of a better way to put it, but even my best alternative was just a watered down rephrasing of the asshole sentiment. Marchetta deliberately muddles a complicated series of events. She constantly obscures how the stories connect. It became frustrating, felt unnecessary, and really detracted from my experience. To stop you from connecting the stories too fast the characters that appear in both stories have two names. Yeah, characters. If it had to be done then it should've only been done once. I enjoy thinking while I read, but I don't enjoy crossword puzzles either.I experienced a bit of name soup in each individual story. There were so many character's running back in Taylor's story, the present day story, that I sort of gave up. There are little girls running around all of whom Taylor is responsible for, other house heads, her friends, the townies, and the military camp group. When you tack on a secondary story with characters who have nicknames and unrevealed proper names it just became too much. I don't think it was me because I've been perfectly capable of keeping track of a large cast before. Also, I had similar feelings about the cast of Saving Francesca.Taylor's story involves the territory wars -- a game the students at the Jellicoe school play against the townies and the military school, but the game is taken very seriously for some reason. Since these games only go on while the military school is out there doing training I never felt the game was as life or death as it felt to the characters. They had to tolerate each other for six (or was it eight?) weeks a year. The fact that the wars were so temporary made me really uninterested in negotiations between the various factions. I didn't get why it was such a big deal for the townies to get access to \"the clubhouse\" if the military school would be gone in a few weeks. It felt like a frivolous thing to invest so many pages on and I could tell the author went back and forth a little on how important the 'wars' were. At one point Taylor marvels at being in a place for the first time in years because they'd lost the territory back then and at other points she says they only actually have to be careful while the military school is around... Well, which is it?The end of the book connects a lot of people and events. It made little snippets of conversation or things peppered through the book come together. Re-reading I saw more connective stuff like 'oh there's the purple notebook' and 'oh mention of the postman,' but I wish this stuff had stuck with me enough to enjoy it all at the conclusion. Of course, if I hadn't found so much of it bloody inane I might have begun to guess at the importance of certain things earlier.There are some timeline things that made no sense to me, like Jessa knowing about the tunnels. Her mother died when she was two and her father lived as a hermit in the woods for years afterward. She doesn't know he was the hermit or that he died. It's implied he didn't stick around long after her mother died because he was afraid of tainting her. Hannah found her in foster care and brought her to Jellicoe, yet somehow her father who had been out of her life for a significant period of time let her know there was a secret tunnel in her dorm building? Eh... No. Unlikely. There were several dorm buildings and her father never knew Jessa while she lived at the school so I think it's all just a little too unlikely.As for the characters, Marchetta made my heartbreak for Tate even though I hated her. She made me feel the tragedy in Hannah wanting to live even after her brother died. She made me want Jonah for Taylor and Hannah's happy ending. I cried more than a little over an apology that needed no forgiveness and the author made the unfinished house from the beginning of the novel into a dream for me too. The conclusions of the book, even the serial killer story, made the rest of the novel worthwhile, but it doesn't blind me to the flaws or how difficult it was for me to slog through some of it.

It's not like my thoughts on the book have much sway on fellow readers. Original post  here.The connection? No, it wasn't all that difficult to figure out. In fact, I had fun with it. It's just like the matching type examinations in school, way back when. I appreciated the mystery and the hint of suspense, of course. It's one aspect of fiction that I thrive in. And even if I did figure out early on that Melina Marchetta was actually narrating two stories - one from the past, one from the present - and that they will eventually tie up in the end, I enjoyed reading this nonetheless. Jellicoe Road is a heartwarming story about friendship, family, love, death and loss, coming to terms with life's trials, and the ties that bind ~ all the important things that transcend time, space and distance. It's what I truly appreciated about the novel, actually. The author begins the story with something just a tad trivial - territory wars - and then comes out strong in the end with all the stuff that matter. The first half is a meandering mess, but the storyline builds up somewhere in the middle so that by the time you get to the second half of the book, you'll be so hooked you'll be unable to put it down. :) Unfortunately, much as I would like to expound on my observations, I highly doubt that I could give an accurate description without revealing too much of the plot, and we really don't want that. Like Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, this book is highly spoilery (is there such a word?), and I don't want to be the one to kill the fun. The writing wasn't exceptional, but I liked its simplicity and straightforwardness. The characters? Well, there were times when I thought Taylor Markham was such a drama queen, but then I try to put myself in her shoes, and while I know I can never relate to her, I think I can comprehend where all the angst was coming from. Jonah Griggs would never be a \"literary crush\" in a million years, but he is perfect for Taylor, and they sincerely deserved each other. Everyone else - Raffaela, Chaz, Hannah, the Brigadier, etc. - were secondary personalities that helped build and shape Taylor's character. The Great Reveal - well, more like Great Reveal in Installments - didn't shock me as much as I thought it would, however. I think that I read through the chapters more for the purpose of confirming what I already know, and it didn't really blow me away. Still, it tugged at my emotions; the realizations and acknowledgments in the end broke my heart, and I appreciated people's histories and how these can change lives, in a major way.

Melina Marchetta\u2019s The Jellicoe Road was the first contemporary Young Adult novel I\u2019ve read, and to be honest, I was not sure what to expect. The story started with a shock, the car accident involving the Schroeders and the Markhams, and I asked myself, will this be one of those sad and tragic stories? Then it was revealed that it was part of a manuscript that the narrator, Taylor Markham, was reading. The setting of Taylor\u2019s world was quite unfamiliar: the school system in Australia, the Houses, the Townies and Cadets, some of the terminologies that were used, all of these for me needed a little of getting used to. I\u2019ve already gone by the first 5 chapters yet I was still not sure how I can get into the story. I felt like an outsider looking in while reading Taylor\u2019s narration and I was not sure if I really care what these kids were going through with their school struggles and seemingly pointless territory wars. My interest was more attuned to the manuscript: the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude felt like it has a lot more grounding since I was a witness to the friendship they forged amidst a horrific tragedy. Then I was in the part in Taylor\u2019s timeline where Hannah left suddenly and Taylor could no longer contain herself and she just needed to confront the principal about it. She revealed that she hated the thought of appearing weak in the eyes of the other students even though deep inside, she felt weak without Hannah. It felt like I understood Taylor a little bit for the first time, for who hasn\u2019t even once in their lives hid what they were really feeling inside, pretending as if everything was ok.I thought there was an inverted contrast between the struggles of the Fab 5 in the manuscript and Taylor: For Taylor, who was having trouble trusting anyone because of her past, her life-question was: how can I trust anyone ever again? Those who were involved in the accident needed each other to survive. For Narnie and the rest, their life-question was: How can we live if we didn\u2019t trust each other to hold us up? Thematically, I thought this was where both worlds would converge, that through friendship, they would find their own self-worth. But not everything\u2019s as neat and ideal as I expected. The novel was dedicated to unfold tragedy after tragedy, and everything began to unravel because of the disappearance (and death) of Webb. Webb was the lynchpin of the Fab-5\u2019s friendship, he was the one holding everyone up, the one who\u2019s passion for life inspired them to continue living. Without him, the consequences were disastrous: Tate left suddenly, Fitz became crazy, Narnie and Judd both harbor guilty feelings about what happened.There was this scene where Narnie and Judd was talking in the river. Narnie said that if Webb disappeared, there will be no one left for her, and she felt she might disappear, and Judd was the only one who was making her feel that her existence has substance and reality. That was a beautiful portrayal about how friendship matters to some people: the presence of others, especially their connection to us, helps ground our existence, the glance of the friend confirms that we are alive, that we are somebody worth it worth it worth it!At first I was disappointed with how the story was progressing in the case of the 5 friends. I thought that in spite of their friendship, they were unable to see their own self-worth, that the friendship didn't give them the strength to survive and flourish. Especially Tate, I thought, how could she leave so suddenly, and how does that honor Webb\u2019s death? Upon further reflection, that was what I wanted to see, but what was the novel actually trying to show? Instead of in spite of, I realized they were able to form friendships that could last a lifetime despite what they've been through. How much could we say about our own lives?It was obvious that there was a connection between the 5 and Taylor\u2019s world. When all of these connections were slowly revealed, Taylor\u2019s issue on trust was being put to the test. Jonah Griggs was her main gateway to recover that capacity to trust again, Raffy and Chaz were the supporting pillars of that gate. Truth be told, I was imagining what my impression is if I met Taylor in person. Without knowing her history, I probably wouldn\u2019t like her because of her moods and attempts to push people away and piss them of in the process. This novel reminded me to always look at a person without judging eyes for we never know what his or her story is. I find the author\u2019s writing style fascinating and frustrating at the same time, it was descriptively sparse and half-the-time muted, it is as if the reader was watching a scene outside a window draped with translucent curtains, never revealing the whole scenery, bending the light and obstructing small portions of the unfolding story. There were some things that the book was silent about that I would have loved to know: how did Taylor react when she was found out that Fitz was the one who killed her father? How did Tate react when she found out about this, or did she ever know? What was going on inside Narnie the whole time that she lost her brother, how did she manage to be strong all of a sudden?Another thing that I liked about the novel was the dream scenes that Taylor included in her narration. I thought dreaming in the novel was how the author showed that people we love who have already passed-on never really left us. A touching moment was when Fitz was finally reconciled with Webb through Taylor and her dream. It is as if to say, some friendships do endure even beyond this world. Even with all the tragedies and the traumas the characters endured throughout the novel, most especially Tate and her daughter, this is one of those books that ended so gracefully and satisfyingly. Taylor, who had trust issues from the start, dropped her insecurities and found the grace of forgiving her mom. Through the inevitable darkness of death, both daughter and mom found intimacy and freedom. Narnie, who had lost her ability to wonder after the car accident, through the healing of belongingness and friendship, finally regained that which speaks volumes: peace within herself and hope for the ever surprising renewal and enchanting journey towards tomorrow.Here are some of the lines in the novel that I really love:\u201cSee, I remember love. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand. And what I also remember is that in telling that tale to the Cadet on the train I got a glimpse of peace.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cThese people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well they can tell what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cWebb was grinning. Tate, too. They always grinned in unison. Like they were thinking the same mind, sharing the same heart.\u201d \u2013 Hannah Manuscript\u201cAnd then you came along and you spoke to me and nobody had looked at me in the eye for years.\u201d \u2013 Jonah talking to Taylor\u201cAnd he knew that, but all his life he\u2019d been treated like crap to the point that he believed that he was crap. He\u2019d never done anything good and nobody had ever said anything positive to him. But that night, on the Jellicoe Road, it was like he was reborn. The lives he saved gave him purpose and he loved those kids more than anything.\u201d Taylor telling the story of Fitz\u201cI remember love. It\u2019s what I have to keep on reminding myself. It\u2019s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that\u2019s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It\u2019s not the pain they\u2019re getting over, it\u2019s the love.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cThen we spoke about our dreams and how we always felt safe in them, no matter how bad everything else seemed.\u201d \u2013 Taylor talking about the Hermit\u201cI want to yell out to everyone, \u201cIt\u2019s a game, these territory wars. They loved each other.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cI\u2019m here because of you. You\u2019re my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don\u2019t think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201d \u2013 Jonah to Taylor\u201cBut living in the heart of Narnie was the only home he had ever had.

It was just so heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.I wanted to give it 5 stars but they are just some small things that.. Well, the book starts pretty confusing!

Technically ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is my second Marchetta contemporary because I had to read LOOKING FOR ALIBRANDI in high school. Either way, I loved this as much as I loved FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK! I cannot wait to delve into more of Marchetta\u2019s contemporary fiction, or all the other books she\u2019s written really.\nDual storylines\nI loved the way this story was told. There are two dual storylines, one from the manuscript and Taylor\u2019s, which overlap a tonne more than I was expecting. So much is inter-related and every single aspect is interesting. I loved the territory wars (it made it so much more entertaining than your usual romance/ family based contemporary) and the depth of the relationships between all the characters.\nSuper Australian\nI\u2019ve never been to boarding school but I\u2019ve been to school my entire life here in Aus, and I can tell you the atmosphere of the Jellicoe school is 100% accurate. Yes, we do have school houses but they\u2019re not as cool as the Hogwarts houses. The lingo in this is also spot on and I really appreciated the use of an Australian narrator for the audiobook!\nTaylor\u2019s growth\nI\u2019m so proud of Taylor. From a girl who really didn\u2019t want any responsibility in the beginning, she grew so much and became a fantastic leader. I can\u2019t believe how much stuff she\u2019s been through in her past, how much many of the characters have been through in their past honestly. They\u2019re all so precious.\nSo many emotions\nI did not expect to be so ruined by this book but it really does destroy all your emotions multiple times. Even the most minor characters pull at your heart strings. It\u2019s so easy to become incredibly connected to every single character, you really feel for them when bad things happen, and when you learn about their past you just want to tuck them under a blanket and give them a massive hug. They\u2019re all so precious.\nIn Summary\nI\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve finally had the opportunity to read some Marchetta contemporaries. ON THE JELLICOE ROAD was fantastic, so full of feels and emotions, I loved everything about it. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of Marchetta\u2019s stuff.

I LOVE that feeling. That feeling I get when I've read something SOOO consuming that I can't move on. I walk around for days in a daze recalling the story and just wanting to be back in that world. So, I knew I had to read Jellicoe Road. I put it on my wish list and then didn't read it until now because many people's reviews have described it as \"slow start\" or \"difficult to understand\" so I began to look at Jellicoe Road as something that would be a chore, but worth it.It wasn't a chore to read at all. I was hooked from the first few pages. The writing is haunting, emotional, and just simply beautiful.Jia also wrote: \"In fact, \u201cenjoyment\u201d seems like too mild a word. After its slow start, the book gathered more and more momentum, until I was completely swept away from thoughts of my own life. I became so invested in Taylor and the other characters in the book that some sections seemed heartbreaking to read, albeit in a cathartic and healing way. I laughed and cried \u2014 or, as my husband put it, \u201cblubbered.\u201d When I finished this book, my tear ducts felt completely empty.\"This is the story of Taylor Markham. A 17 yo student at the Jellicoe School. A private/state school in rural Australia. When she was 10, Taylor was abandoned at a 7 Eleven by her mother in a nearby town, and has lived at Jellicoe School ever since then. This is also the story of five kids that attended Jellicoe School (or 3 attended Jellicoe school, one was a cadet, and one a Townie) in the generation preceeding Taylor's. Their story is slowly revealed, as their relationship to Taylor is revealed. Jellicoe School students engage in territory warfare with the local kids and a troop of cadets that camp nearby for 8 weeks every year. At the beginning of the story, Taylor is instated as the leader of the Jellicoe kids so she must engage in negotiations and strategy at a time of great confusion for her as she slowly unravels the mysteries of the past. The woman at Jellicoe School whom she has become the closest to has disappeared with no word to her. Taylor is left feeling betrayed, confused and mentally unbalanced.This story is HEARTWRENCHING and absorbing. I loved it. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars (due to my complete love of the characters) is some frustration I have with almost every adult in this book.I don't like their secrets. They are unnecessary and cruel. I also don't like that they all supposedly love Taylor SO MUCH, yet Taylor has NO ONE for the majority of her life. I hate that with a white hot passion.

I loved Jonah, and Taylor rang true for me as a portrayal of a teenager who had grown up in very difficult circumstances and then been abandoned as a child. I really felt for most of the characters. What I loved most was how the characters frequently acted like real people, not perfect facsimiles. This made the relationships between the characters rocky at time, but much more touching.I do, however, have some criticisms. First, I just didn't \"get\" the territory wars in which the three groups of teenagers participated. The war didn't sound fun for the most part to me, in fact quite the opposite, so I don't understand why they would keep competing/fighting with each other. Did they really have absolutely nothing better to do with their time? Plus, where was the adult supervision? But ultimately, this issue of mine didn't really end up mattering.

At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start. There's some violence - car accidents, fights, a suicide, hints of child abuse - that are more emotionally intense than graphic, as are the brief sex scenes. Updated: she's won the Printz!

It\u2019s not the pain they\u2019re getting over, it\u2019s the love.\nI really liked it but being honest, I was expecting to be wowed about it just because it is the most infamous and best rated Melina\u2019s book, excepting Lumatere\u2019s sequels. I have really enjoyed the reading. The story, the characters, the pace are good as you could expect from Melina but I found the writing in her Lumatere\u2019s Chronicles superlative and remember Saving Francesca more captivating, even though the later is a simpler story. Still loving Merchetta, though, \nbecause I do love the second half\n.\u201dI think back to my dream of the boy, because in it I find solace. I like that word. I\u2019m going to make it my word of the year. There is something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong. Belong. Long to be.I would have liked it much more if Melina had enlightened me at least about the generation of the characters earlier in the book. There were a lot of moments during the first half where I didn\u2019t have a clue about who was who in Hanna\u2019s book or at the territorial wars, how old they were, if they were contemporaneous or whether they were related to each other or not. Part of reason why was the mystery needed to be solved (the boy of the tree in her dreams) but another part could have been easily fixed with just a few clarifications. I might have missed the hints even if they were there for me, but I know that I\u2019m not the only one out there being so confused and therefore fearing through almost all the first half to be put out of the story -That didn\u2019t really happened because I enjoy trying to get my bearings in this kind of books-. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoilering anyone with some clarifications. The book is told from Taylor Markham\u2019s -a Jellicoe Road student- point of view. Somehow her thirtysomething tutor\u2019s past in her teenage years \u2013at that time she was known as Narnie, but her actual name is Hannah- will has repercussions on Taylor\u2019s life. We get Hannah\u2019s POV in third person via a book written by her. Jellicoe Road and its summertime territorial wars against Cadets and Townies were first fought by Hannah and her friends twenty years ago, but the teens war still takes place each summer until now and those are a few of the many connecting links of both characters and stories.\u201dWe\u2019ve lost a substantial amount of territory. It\u2019s been split up between the Cadets and Townies.\u201dLove the characters. All of them, but I specially loved Griggs, Webb, Ben, Santangelo and Jude in this story (warning, I\u2019m mixing two different timelines here ;P. Don\u2019t get lost, teehee). I know, I have mentioned almost all the male characters. Melina makes up amazing male characters, all age included!The territorial wars were also fun \u2013 they brought me back sweet memories from my childhood when I read The War of the Buttons, one of the few books my father recommended to me when I was little \u2013 \u2026 and Richard booms, \u201cNo prisoners! No prisoners! \u2013 which is ridiculous, because it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to kill them, but he has this Lawrence of Arabia obsession\u2026\u201d Loved the (arch-enemies\u2019s) friendship. Love grown-ups and teens relationships. (view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier\u2019s: \u201dSuddenly, I\u2019m somewhere else, in another time. On the shoulders of a giant. I had wanted to be my father\u2019s shoulders an all this time they were Jude\u2019s. But he holds on to me in a way that Hannah never has. I feel his relief, like he hasn\u2019t held someone in a long, long time. And he\u2019s wanted to. (hide spoiler)]Loved all the love stories. They are small but so deep felt! Melina, you do write amazingly about feelings.(view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier\u2019s\u2026: He had never heard emotion from Narnie before and now\u2026 now it was so loud, so gut-wrenching that he wanted to cover his mouth with his hand. but Taylor and Jonah\u2019s was so beautiful too! (hide spoiler)]In the end it was not the big tearjerker I was fearing of (and I\u2019m happy that it wasn\u2019t) so if that\u2019s what was holding you back, that cannot be a deterrent for you either, really. As I say, you don\u2019t really need to be looking for signs of incoming tragedy as I did. Heartbreaking past tragedies are there to overshadow Taylor Markham\u2019s, Jonah Griggs\u2019s (and Hanna\u2019s) present -as it happened in Lumatere\u2019s and Charyn\u2019s kingdoms- but thanks to Melina I could handle all the sad events that took place in the Jellicoe Road in both timelines.

I started thinking about how to kick this off when I reached the halfway point in the book yesterday. I thought about starting with some kind of song. Some lyrics. Coldplay kept popping into my mind, but then I abandoned the idea and moved on. Hence, the beginning of this review is just me telling you about how I don\u2019t know how to begin.When I don\u2019t give a pretty great or well-loved book five stars, I like to explain why it lost that one star before I talk about how it earned the four. So I\u2019ll start there, and even in my criticisms, I promise to be respectful of this novel and I hope I never sound as though I didn\u2019t really love it. Because oh, how I loved it. Please don\u2019t think me over-sensitive. There are a few things that sometimes really bug me in a book. The F-word. I don\u2019t think it needed to be used so often. Of course I never think it\u2019s necessary to use it at all, but I can deal with it being in there several times. But this seemed like a lot to me. I know everyone has a different conception of a lot. I just would have liked this so much better if there hadn\u2019t been so many F-bombs. Maybe it adds realism or something for some people, but I just don\u2019t think the F-word does anything for a story but take away from it. I\u2019ve never said that word, I don\u2019t much like to hear it in my head. That being said, I\u2019d like to say that the \u201clove scenes\u201d were handled very well, being pretty vague. Less is more, people, less is more. I didn\u2019t feel like my brain was being infiltrated with filth and I didn\u2019t have to skip pages. Yay, Marchetta! If this hadn't been handled the way it was, it would have ended up being a complaint. But it's not. I applaud the author for this.And oh my goodness, these characters are wonderful. All of them. From Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, and Jude. To Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz, and even Ben. Notice that in both cases it\u2019s a group with 3 boys and 2 girls? Ben is sort of left out sometimes, but I\u2019m finding that rather interesting, even though it hasn\u2019t got much bearing on the story at all. xD Can I just say right now that I love Jonah Griggs? Okay. I love him. I also love how the two different stories are interwoven. This is literary genius. It\u2019s like a mystery but not a mystery at all. It was fun to pick apart the two stories and figure out how they fit together. It really kept me interested even through the slow parts. (view spoiler)[But I\u2019m such a dunce that I didn\u2019t figure out the thing about Fitz accidentally shooting Webb until the last chapter. Yeah, I am blushing about my stupidity. (hide spoiler)] Basically, I\u2019ve go to say, this book starts out really strangely. I was totally confused through the first few chapters. But then it starts to make sense, and it just gets better the more we figure out what\u2019s going on. If you stick with it through the odd beginning, you\u2019ll be glad you did. Finally, I\u2019d like to touch on what this book is, at its heart, about. It\u2019s about grief and hurt and it\u2019s about forgiveness. It\u2019s about getting through the toughest times and learning to trust and love. It\u2019s about learning to let people in.I know someday I'll read this again. I don't know how soon that day will be, but I know I'll travel down Jellicoe Road again eventually. It was a worthwhile journey.

But there's nothing more endearing for me than a tale about friendship, family, loss and trying to do the right thing. Last year I read Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, it was my first book by this writer, and while I loved her writing style and narration, I couldn't fully connect with the story, the characters were likeable and the story was full of witty remarks and smart little jokes, but still it was just an ok read, for me. But Jellico Road! oh man! this book broke my heart, but it was so worth it!Jellico Road is centered in Taylor's story, her life, we help her discover where she comes from, what mysteries surrounds her and the people around her, and how everything intertwines with her mother's childhood, her only companion Hannah, the manuscript Hannah is writing and the man that visits Taylor every night in her dreams. This book was magical, really! the atmosphere, the sadness and melancholy aspects of the story are things I've only encountered once or twice in books, and those are the sort of books you go back to from time to time, looking for that little spark of emotion that most YA contemporary lack nowadays. I love how Melina's writing is not pretentious or manipulative, even thought its a very emotional book. I feel like some authors play with our emotions and calculate every scene in their story with some sort of \"cue for crying part\" bits, they manipulate the reader and they plan every aspect of their books, and strategically place the sobfest bits in order to get a reaction from us. Melina does emotional and sadness in a effortlessly manner, and I loved that about this book. Those are the books that really catch me of guard. The only struggle I had with Jellicoe Road were the first 100 pages. It was confusing to read about all this territory wars between the schools and the Cadets, it was not very interesting to me, and I would've like it a lot more if in between all this sort of \"useless\" details we maybe get to know Taylor a bit more. Also, I think the author dedicates too much time in that aspect of the story that serves little purpose at the conclusion and resolution of the problematic in hand. Regardless of my struggles with the first part, I 100% recommend this book! I think all you need is patience and curiosity to not DNF this book. The writing style and pace makes it easy to continue reading, and once you hit the 53% ish mark, you can't put it down. I will definitely will re read this book at some point, and I'm not a big rereader, but this one deserves it. And I will definitely checkout other books by Melina Marchetta, I'm sold on discovering more of her work, if this is just a little taste of what she can do.

Yet I failed, which caused me to miss out on this excellent book until now. When I tried reading it previously, I was deterred by the initial chapters. Several characters are introduced and discerning the relations between them is difficult. The narrative voice and year switches without notice, and there is something about a battle between Townies, Cadets, and Houses but it's nearly impossible to figure out what it is. Later on, of course, I realized how crucial these chapters are to the story and their confusing nature sets up much of the plot; however, for a person sitting down to read this without any previous knowledge of the book, I understand why he or she may leave it unfinished. If I recommend this book to anyone (and I likely will since it's fantastic), I will reassure them that the beginning is confusing and hard but it will all make sense in a wonderful book payoff. Besides the beginning, the rest of the book is nearly flawless, except for perhaps some of the ending. Jellicoe Road is a dramatic book, but near the end, I felt like it somewhat descended to melodrama, but maybe that's just my apathetic, unfeeling self talking. I was willing to excuse it because of the book's dramatic nature; I mean, the story commences with an accident involving five fatalities. Squashed between the minorly problematic beginning and end is a glorious middle section crammed with territory games, discoveries of past stories, a magnificent love interest, and even a serial killer! When I remember this novel, though, I'll think of the friendships shared between the original five friends--Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude (even their names are amazing)--and the modern friends--Taylor, Griggs, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben. The adventures of the original five, though tainted with sadness, reminded me of when I was younger, traipsing around with a troop of neighborhood kids, inventing wild games from morning until the moon came up. Although none of my childhood friends died, we are no longer close, so the nostalgia and regret felt by Narnie and Jude reflected something I think all grown-up childhood friends must cope with: the loss of that idyllic time and its relationships.

For at least an hour after finishing On the Jellicoe Road last night, my head was still mulling it over, putting all the pieces in place.

This is probably one of those \u2018very good\u2019-on-a-first-read-but-\u2018outstanding\u2019-on-a-re-read books.Melina Marchetta tackles some of the big themes in this book: About parents leaving their children, about tragic events that ripple through the rest of your life and into that of the next generation. About relationships you don\u2019t actually know the significance of, and about the meaning of \u2018home\u2019.I do have to admit that this book didn\u2019t have the same emotional gut-punching power her other earth-based young adult novels have (Saving Francesca, The Piper\u2019s Son). I had heaps of Kleenex next to me, but it wasn\u2019t necessary. The only character that came close to getting to me was \u2018The Brigadier\u2019: Clearly the good guy, taking care of all the others, desperate to belong, but even the important things he has passed onto other people, like safety and love, are being attributed to someone else in their mis-shapen memories.The story itself has 5 star potential, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this book could have been so much better still. Structurally, I believe it was more confusing at the start than it needed to be. Why are we reading the manuscript as a reader before Taylor finds it? Wouldn\u2019t it have been more logic to wait?Content-wise there are a few gaps too that don\u2019t get explained (spoilers ahead): why did Hannah leave without saying a word \u2013 it seemed totally out of character? Why did Hannah never mention what her relationship was to Taylor \u2013 it seemed like there were many options here? I also could have done with less teen romance to be honest, because the relationship between the adults and the kids are what made this book so exquisite, and the romance angle got in the way for me.Still, it\u2019s a really good young adult novel, and I definitely enjoyed reading it.

The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la.\u201d***I\u2019m compelled to rate this novel 5 stars (I'm really not stingy about giving books 5 stars), but for the wrong reason. The wrong reason being: peer pressure. All my GR friends gave this book a 5 star rating. It\u2019s like a rite of passage, if you want to be taken as a \u2018serious\u2019 reader, you\u2019d obviously have to be able to appreciate MM. And certainly, this book is an exemplary standard of what contemporary YA literature \u201cshould be,\u201d instead of low-culture trash, like the Twilight series...And, while I admit my distaste for the Twilight series, I\u2019d like to believe I\u2019m not so snobby, or pretentious enough to look down on my fellow GR friends that actually enjoyed reading Twilight. However, it\u2019d be a different story if they were claiming Twilight to be a masterful piece of literature, and that the film(s) blew their minds. Then, I might have to crawl under a rock. And weep, silently. However, here\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t rate this book a 5:First, I didn\u2019t dislike the book. I did like it, and appreciated it so much more than Saving Francesca. But, like others have mentioned, the story started off a bit slow, and very confusing; and yet, I don\u2019t think it HAD to be. So, if the confusion served no greater purpose in the story, why make it so difficult for the readers? Now, moving on to the romance...Why do authors feel the need to insert a love story in almost every single \u201cyoung-adult\u201d novel?! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all about the romance. But, what can I say about Griggs? He\u2019s about as generic a character as Edward, from Twilight. What was so proprietary about his character that warrants praise from so many readers? He was a twisted, brooding soul, with a horrific, brutal past, and violent tendencies. Wow. That\u2019s just so deep, right? Well, I guess I was expecting a bit more from his interactions with Taylor. There were glimpses of the moments Griggs & Taylor shared on that train when they were 14. And, they do spend quite some \u2018interacting\u2019 because of the territory wars. Yet, their romance was just a secondary story, in the overall plot, and it showed. This was my greatest let down (not that their romance was a secondary story, but that it felt like one). I would\u2019ve liked to see more. Feel more. Not just told that Taylor\u2019s love for him was so deep, and that no words could describe how she felt about him. Then, there\u2019s Taylor. She\u2019s the asthmatic girl that was left behind near a 7-eleven, abandoned by her druggie mother at the tender age of 7. That one line of description opens up so many possibilities. This character could\u2019ve been so rich, and multifaceted. I could\u2019ve been weeping, and hailing Taylor as one of my all-time favorite fictional heroines. And yet, there was such a deep bitterness to her that I couldn\u2019t fully embrace. Also, I know this is totally messed up of me, and I\u2019m likely to be accused of being some kind of masochist, but, I would\u2019ve liked to see her knee-deep in trouble. She was obviously suffering, angry, and confused, yet she was picked to be the leader of her turf, and she seemed to be a good girl, for the most part. What happened to that girl that ran away? Where was all that anger, confusion, and desperation? OK, so she avoided her friends, treated them coldly, and didn\u2019t want to form deep attachments. And, she had strange dreams\u2026 So what? I wanted to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell her pain. I didn\u2019t. **However, despite my \u2018issues\u2019 with the book, I did find the writing to be particularly inspired. I especially loved the vivid, detailed imagery of Jellico Road. I also liked The Prayer Tree (what it symbolized), and all of the side stories, effortlessly woven together, to forge a harrowing coming of age story, dealing with loss, forgiveness, family, and love. \u201cThere is just something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong.

I'm pretty sure I didn't cry over it as a teenager (I've turned into a big old softie).I kept thinking while I was reading: \"this is the quintessential contemporary YA book.\" Like it's as good as contemporary YA is ever going to get. For me, in 2010, it was exactly the kind of book I wanted to read or write myself. It's off the charts angsty (angst being something I was incapable of recognizing as a teen, mired in it). Basically every major character is messed up colossally. It can get a little melodramatic just from the sheer number of tragedies in less than 300 pages spread through relatively few characters; two moms dying from cancer, two manslaughters committed by teens, a suicide and attempted one, a fatal car crash, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, a serial killer...But melodrama actually isn't a crime in fiction as some might have you believe, and Marchetta's prose is lovely enough you know you're in good hands. I think Marchetta is so sincere and writes so well that she steers clear of seeming like she's emotionally manipulating you with all the tragedy, when in clumsier and more cynical hands, this same story would become graceless.I think it's quite lovely how everything comes together, though perhaps the strands are arranged a little too widely at the start which accounts for the confusion this book sometime causes readers at the beginning. Even though I cried this time around I'm somehow less touched by this book now then as a teen. I'm glad I read it at just the right time; the impact a book has on you is definitely based on when you read it in your life. Sometimes a book speaks to you more, depending on where you are in life. Jellicoe Road no longer speaks to me as deeply as it did when I was its target audience but I'm happy it once did.I think a lot of what separates me now from as a teenager is it's harder for me to unabashedly love things.I'm dropping the rating from 5 to 4 stars since it no longer qualifies as a favorite for me, even if it once was.

I usually read speculative fiction or historical, usually with a romantic twist or two, and normally with a happy ending. This book had some of those elements but what it mostly was, was a beautiful tale of friendship, love, hardship, grief, growth and death.Set in a small country town in rural Australia, Jellicoe Road begins somewhat confusingly with a first person narrative of a young girl watching her parents die in a car crash. I say confusing because although this narrative is first person, this is not the main protagonist of the book. The only way you figure this out is at the beginning it says it is set 22 years later, but the main protagonist, Taylor, is only 17.Nevertheless, once you sort out who's tale you are listening to, the initial dreamy sequences seguay into a lovely tale of three different groups of children fighting territory wars that the adults know nothing about. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing deadly about these wars, it is merely a way to make the life in the country a little more exciting, and you find out in a series of flashbacks (not really flashbacks but too complicated to explain in a review and I don't want to spoil the revelations) who created the territory wars.Taylor is a young girl without a mother. She was abandoned at age 11 at the Seven Eleven on the Jellicoe Rd. She was taken in by Hannah, who is also a kind of house mother to the girls in her boarding house at school. Taylor has several issues. She witnessed a hermit kill himself when she was 14. She cannot relate to any of the girls in her house and she has repressed most of her childhood memories.She has been voted in as head of the students at her school which means she is the one who must devise the strategies in the territory wars. In the beginning she is finding it hard to relate to her schoolmates and she has to ward off coup attempts as well as all the incessant questions from her Year 7s.The best thing about this book, I think, is the growth of Taylor as a person. She starts off the book as a loner who has weird dreams to someone with a large circle of friends and family.This book made me cry, it made me laugh, it has some of the best rounded out characters of any I've read, be it a small character or a main one.

The story is real and raw in its heart breaking emotions, and includes hints of the magic and the wonders of life that we can never fully understand but should always take time to appreciate.The cast of characters in Jellicoe Road is well-developed and filled with amazing and heart-wrenching backstories, though it almost seems ridiculous how much tragic background stories can exist in one book. Even so, the characters stir emotions as they come to terms with their personal histories and how that\u2019s shaped them into who they are and who they want to become. Taylor, the main character, is stand-offish and resentful of the world around her, but as she begins to open up and regard each person around her with more understanding, the result is a beautiful story of growth and finding good in the world; no matter how bad things may or might have been. Adding in an interesting collection of friends, adults, and a wonderful love-interest, the characters move this story and provide a lot of its beauty.The writing is powerful and captures raw emotions and feelings not easily expressed with expert detail.

I spent the first several chapters feeling mostly disappointed, but also frustrated, because I really wanted to love it and I wasn't sure that I did...love it, that is.Taylor was such an unlikable character that was full of annoying teenage angst. She almost came off as spiteful and petulant. I couldn't understand her, or the strange world she lived in. At first, it didn't make much sense, and I was trying to grasp all the pieces of the puzzle that were being thrown at us, bit by bit. The townies and the cadets and all the houses and this battle that the three groups were caught up in, each led by one character. Taylor being one, Griggs, and Santiago.Then there's this whole other story being told about 5 friends, an accident that brought them together, and a life that they lived together. It takes a while to clarify that this back story is important and directly connected to current events. Then there are Taylor's dreams of a boy in a tree, which also don't make any sense. So that whole set up was quite confusing for me, and hard to follow. However, once the pieces started to come together, and I started to understand and see the bigger picture and connect all the dots...well, I found it to be heart wrenching and incredibly beautiful and amazing. I loved the relationship that blossomed between Griggs and Taylor. I loved the friendships that were created, the bonds that formed, the different set of characters and their quirks. Once the story was over, I felt it leaving a mark, and it stayed with me long after I had finished it. The only reason I wasn't able to give it 5 stars was Taylor. Even though I sympathized with her and rooted for her, I found her so annoying. Her sudden bouts of irritability and crabbiness and the way she'd sulk like a child were frustrating, and although I understood where she came from, it didn't mean I was OK with the way she treated her friends and loved ones.Otherwise, a wonderfully told story, with so much beauty and tragedy intertwined.", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2019", "own"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3490510879", "review_id": "3490510879", "date": "Jan 15, 2021", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Paige", "user_url": "/user/show/11119449-paige", "text": "I was in a reading slump, otherwise I think I could have read this in a day.

I ended up really\u00a0enjoying this read, but I have to say the first part of the story is\u00a0quite\u00a0confusing. Luckily I was warned that the first part is exactly\u00a0that and they told me to just keep reading and things would soon start to make sense. They were right. This novel by Melina Marchetta is without doubt very well written and the whole confusement in the beginning is actually part of the charm. Why haven't I given it an even higher rating? It may seem that I'm contradicting myself, but I don't think I would have continued reading without the warning that the beginning is hard to understand. The characters are very well developed though and once you get an idea of the whole situation the prose and plot just suck you right in. If you like realistic fiction and don't mind a confusing beginning, On The Jellicoe Road might just be the perfect read for you!Taylor was abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road when she was eleven and ended up at a boarding school. When she was fourteen, she decided to run away and try to find her mom, but she was tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now she is seventeen and the leader of the school's underground community, having to lead the annual territory war with the Townies and the visiting Cadets. This year the Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a guy she has some history with. When the only adult Taylor trusts, Hanna, disappears, things get even more complicated for Taylor... Now she not only has to make sure they don't lose any more territory, but she also wants to try and piece together the clues Hannah left behind. What is the real history of Jellicoe Road?The beginning of On The Jellicoe Road didn't completely convince me, but the rest of the story more than made up for it. The prose, the characters, the plot and plot twists... Melina Marchetta used those in a way that once you are past the confusing part, you just can't stop reading. I will probably try to do a reread at some point, since I will most likely enjoy this read even better the second time around. If you like the genre, I would definitely recommend this one; just remember that it may take a while before you can fully understand what the story is about. (hide spoiler)]P.S.

Hannah is her only real adult family member and as a result, she feels extremely close to her; however, Hannah up and leaves the boarding school without explanation. Taylor is beside herself with worry; plus, she is the leader of her dorm in the territory wars and is very reluctant about the whole thing. To make matters worse, Jonah, a boy she has history with, is back in town and is the leader of another group in the territory wars. While all this is going on in the back of her mind Taylor is still worried about Hannah and her whereabouts. Does it have anything to do with her mom? Melina Marchetta's puzzling and award winning novel, Jellicoe Road, took me on a wild roller coaster ride and didn't let me go until the story's final page.Ok. So. I am not going to lie. I pretty much loathed Jellicoe Road for the first one hundred or so pages. I wish you guys could have heard my inner monologue. I reminded myself of my students when they first encounter Shakespeare. I was saying things like, \"Huh? Territory wars? Is this a dystopia? Am I in Maze Runner right now?\".......\"Wait. What's this part in italics?\" .......\"How did this win the Printz award? There's so story, really.\" ........\"Am I even comprehending what is going on here? What the heck?\" Needless to say, I was extremely confused. Since Marchetta is a new-to-me author, I had a hard time trusting her in that the story would make sense as I continued to read. Thanks to fellow bloggers, I was told to hold on and keep going. To me, it was like a bad workout. I didn't want to continue, because it was hard and I was tired, but afterwards, I was happy I ran that extra mile and felt pretty good about it.Taylor's story is interrupted several times with another story about five teens from the past. At first, readers will have no clue what is going on, but as you read further the teen's story is interwoven expertly into Taylor's. As a reader, you must have patience with this as you have NO prior knowledge concerning this what.so.ever. Don't get me wrong....I like a little mystery and confusion in my books, but this was more like 100 or so pages of not knowing anything.On a positive note, Marchetta is a brilliant writer. I was shocked by the second half of the book, because I didn't think she could really \"fix\" the mess of the first half. However, she proved me wrong. The puzzle came together and I definitely had that \"A-HA!\" moment when everything made sense. I can honestly say I've never read a story like Jellicoe Road. It is very unique as is Marchetta's writing style as well.But here is what is on my mind: Yes, Jellicoe Road is beautifully written, but I wonder how many teenagers will actually stick with the first half of the book? I know many of my 8th graders would probably give up and put it down, because most like to be sucked into a story from the start. In fact, many bloggers said that had to reread the book or pick it up again at a later date in order to get through it. Hmm.... To me, this aspect of Jellicoe Road takes away from the reader's overall enjoyment. So all in all, do I feel Jellicoe Road is well written? Yes. Do I feel that it's an interesting puzzle of a story? Yes. Is it life changing as many claim it to be? No, not for me, but that doesn't mean I won't be picking up her other novels in the future.

If there's a connection between Hannah and Taylor in terms of blood or legal guardianship, Taylor doesn't seem to be aware of it. She only remembers her mother dumping her in town when she was 11 and has amnesia about most of the events of her childhood including that time when the local nut shot himself to death in her presence. Also, Taylor's never seen a therapist for any of this which seems incredibly neglectful on the part of both her school and Hannah.Got that?Okay, Taylor has just been elected as the leader of the School Kids who, every year, wage some kind of 3 way war with the Cadets and the Townies. They can do this because the teachers, who are occasionally referred to, never make an appearance. The boarding school kids also do all their own cooking which I found odd. Teenagers aren't known for making great dietary choices plus this seems an open invitation to give everyone food poisoning. Interspersed with all this are Hannah's stories about 5 kids from 22 years ago who were in a horrific car accident, became best friends and had a bunch of adventures but then one of them disappeared and another one got pregnant and two of them fell in love but couldn't be with each other and oh, once they built a tunnel but that might just be a myth and...You see the problem here?

Taylor our protagonist is appointed leader of her school's secret army and is abandoned by Hannah, one of the only people she trusts. She must fight for her territory against the Townies and Cadets while in emotional turmoil. Her peers question whether she is capable of leading them, especially because she clearly has a past with one of the opposing community leaders, Jonah Griggs. Taylor must uncover what has really happened to Hannah, find out whether she can ever trust Griggs again and piece together who she really is. Marchetta has a beautiful writing style that keeps you guessing to the very last chapter. She pieces together her story with fluid twists that are a pleasure to unfold. Her characters are believable and have distinct personalities which is suprising since this book has a massive cast. I loved the segments of manuscript that was written by Hannah woven into the story as it gave us a small yet insightful look into the past. Taylor was a good protagonist and I really feel like we went on a journey with her, at times she wasn't likable but I sympathized with her story. I didn't like the secrecy much and it fell flat at times especially because I don't think it was necessary for Taylor to go through what she did just to get answers about her family. The rivalry was a little silly too, it was obvious that these were just normal kids who wanted to get along deep down and it was bizarre to me that this tradition had gone on as long as it had. I really liked the ending but unlike others I didn't get that emotional, I think Taylor got all the answers she needed and I didn't think it was sad, to be honest I was quite happy for her.

More thoughts soon.***UPDATE***Full post at It's A Wonderful Bookworld.On The Jellicoe Road is one of those books that comes highly recommended by my friends at the book club. And I understand why. It talks about timeless themes of friendships, belongingness, and family, and of how relationships thrive despite having to go through grief and loss.This book was my first Melina Marchetta and I loved it. As what most reviews say, reading On The Jellicoe Road feels like being confronted with a puzzle with a hundred pieces to put together \u2014 you start excitedly but a few pieces in, you are tempted to ditch the project and just do something else, but then you still trudge on because you see a piece and you feel that this might be a part of a very pretty picture. Little by little, as you go along, the picture gets clearer and clearer until you are almost done, putting the very last few pieces, and you feel that the effort and the journey were all worth it.

There are two different sets of characters, one group from the past, and a contemporary one, with no clues as to how they fit together, complicated by the fact that the characters' names are Australian and not obvious (at least to this American) which ones belong to boys, and which ones to girls. You learn right off that there was a car accident that brought five kids together in the past, and that there's a girl named Taylor trying to figure out what they have to do with her now. Fortunately, the plot is strong enough and rewarding enough to be worth it. I got to the end, and just as many other reviewers have said, immediately started again from the beginning.The main character is Taylor, a GIRL, and a student at the boarding school on Jellicoe Road. She's almost an orphan, and lives there year-round, since her mother left her at the age of nine. But Taylor knows there's a lot about her mother's life she doesn't know, and the READER knows it must have something to do with that other timeline. The hard part, the part that takes patience, is reading far enough into the book to find out how.In the meantime, the students of the boarding school are in a complicated wargame they play every year, with the townies and the cadets over territory, that is both fascinating and amusing. Adding to the fun, the intimidating leader of the cadets has a history with Taylor, leader of the students, and the leader of the townies has a history with Taylor's second in command, Raffaela. Oh! And there's a serial killer of kids lurking in the background of the story, too. Listen, just GO with it. Let yourself be confused while tearing through this puzzling yet engrossing book, and then once you have all the pieces, read the beginning again.

I really liked the story and the main character \u2013Taylor- as well, of course there are many main characters not just her, But the story is from her POV .So to summarize the whole idea without spoilers \u2013which is hard- we can say that it starts with Taylor, a teenager who's in Jellicoe school which consists of six houses. Taylor was left by her mother 7 years ago In this place and she's been taken care of by a woman called Hannah. But this place, where Taylor is, have its traditions. The traditions are that the school students, the Townies and the Cadets -who come to camp every year in this area- are to have wars. This is all according to an old purple book that no one knows who wrote it. This purple book includes all the rules about the war between the three factions. However, at the beginning of the book, Taylor gets chosen to be the leader of her school in this war and she's given the purple book. But as the war goes on and as the deals are being made\u2026.. everyone is finding out new and important information that are related to the past. And the info is very important to Taylor and others for a reason. So throughout the book there are so many secrets which are going to be known. So many mysteries that are going to be solved.

Every word is carefully chosen and has a special purpose for the story. Melina Marchetta is a super talented storyteller, and I\u2019m looking forward to reading more books by her. My main issue with Jellicoe Road is that you have to be extremely focused while reading, because every detail is important. It might not seem like a big deal while reading it, but then 150 pages later it\u2019s suddenly of great significance for the story. (view spoiler)[Such as the postman being the serial killer. (hide spoiler)] This also makes me want to re-read this book, because I\u2019m interested in discovering details I must\u2019ve missed while reading it for the first time.  Overall, this is an amazing book (with a crazy but really impressing plot). If you start reading and nothing makes sense to you, don\u2019t fret - just keep reading!

I think on reread of a physical copy this could really be a 5 star read for me but as the first 50% of the audio was super confusing I just wasn't that excited about it. I didn't even realise there were two time lines and what was happening. ONCE I did realise the two timelines and who was in them I really started to enjoy myself, there is so much grief and just pain in this book, in kids lives. There is also a lot of awesome friendships, of student relationships, and loves. Love is a big part of this book, holding back love, \"forbidden\" love, the family love your not sure you should feel, the love that you don't or can't let yourself feel.I really loved the relationship between Gregs and Taylor they felt real, they fought, they had real problems and it wasn't all star gazing and picnics. The one standout in the audio is the narrator being so aussie, the writing along is super aussie as is but she really brought the aussie to life for me. After becoming so used to american and english narrators it was really cool to be hearing someone who sounds like myself telling a story that I could imagine perfectly. There's drama, mystery, disaster, sadness, bad parents, dead parents, sad kids, angry kids, and a whole lot to love in this book.

Hands down. I feel overwhelmed. I\u2019m sad and I\u2019m happy. You know, after reading a book you sometimes wonder how it would\u2019ve been different if something changed about it, or how you would have wanted it to be some other way. This is the story where I want nothing to change. I love it how it is. It\u2019s a story I\u2019ll never forget.When I started Jellicoe Road, it took me some time to get into the story. I was confused as to how the two stories were supposed to be related and it was mainly because I couldn\u2019t read more than a few pages at a time. When I finally got into the story, I admit I had predicted some things but I don\u2019t mind it at all because it felt like the author wanted me to know. Taylor had it figured out herself so it\u2019s not as if she was some dumb, stubborn, moody protagonist. She did get on my nerves in the beginning. She pushed everyone away and had so many issues that I got angry on her at times but later, reading the story, I sat there feeling choked up with my eyes burning and trying to push back the tears because I was sitting around everyone reading the book and I didn\u2019t want to draw attention to myself. Marchetta has such a beautiful way of writing a story. She is really a great author and I\u2019m kinda shocked that it took me so long to discover her work. I felt everything that Taylor felt. It\u2019s been sometime since I fell in love with the characters of a story. I adore everyone in this book. I love Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Jude, Taylor, Jonah, Raf, Chaz, Ben, and almost everyone else. Marchetta so beautifully manages to make every character she has mentioned in the story involved. Everyone is part of the story, unlike some authors who manage to bring up so many unimportant characters that are not even related to the story and are just made up and just as suddenly, simply gone. I can\u2019t even imagine how it would\u2019ve been for kids who became orphans in just a matter of minutes and how it became the turning event in all their lives. How that one accident took everything away from them and then gave them so much in return. To even imagine what Narnie, Webb or Tate had to go through, is like feeling someone crushing something inside me. I get very emotional when any character\u2019s parent dies and in this story there is so much loss that I kept staring at a wall, blocking my thoughts listening to other\u2019s talk around me, so that I don\u2019t lose it infront of everyone. Every character in this story is significant and everyone is so different and each one of them has to face their own personal demons but when they are together, they simply enjoy each other\u2019s company. And to have a relationship like those guys is something that can make anyone envious. Figuring out everything with Taylor and being with her on the roller-coaster ride of emotions was such a journey! I love her character. Truly. She had been through so much and she tried so hard to never get attached to anyone and tried so hard to hide emotions when she could hardly keep them in. She was so strong and even in her vulnerability, she did not fail to amaze me. She was broken but she held herself for everyone. I loved her relationship with Raf and Ben and Chaz and most importantly Jonah. Jonah and Taylor were perfect for each other and it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve loved two characters in a relationship together. Jonah knew how to act around her when she lost her temper. He didn\u2019t sugar-coat anything and he was on her face and wasn\u2019t scared of her like the others. He knew how to deal with her mood tantrums and in the same way Taylor was everything for him. She gave him a reason to survive and she understood him just as he understood her. *squeeeeeeeee* I feel giddy thinking about them together. Gee, I feel so girly. Anyways, if I start writing about the things that made me depressed or that I particularly liked, I would end up writing everything. So, I\u2019m going to keep it short and say that it\u2019s a story to know, a story to read, a story to remember, and a story that will make you cry with sadness as well as happiness. I loved the pacing, I loved how there were two stories and how those two stories were related together. I think I deserve a pat on the back for not bawling my eyes out and believe me there were moments when I would have just done that if not for the company. I have an urge to re-read it all over again and I will. Soon. The starting was shaky and the war seemed to be a frivolous issue but when I was in high school I remember having the same kind of rivalry with girls and guys of other schools for no reason..only cause it was. So, I guess I can see that. Also, Jesse knowing about where the tunnel was to save her life and Chloe's seemed unlikely.

I started before falling asleep and then I picked it up the next morning and could not put it down until I was finished. Now, that may sound strange when I tell you that I almost didn't finish it after reading the first few chapters. I think I was just too tired to deal with the way it was written. It's sort of a puzzle at first, trying to decipher what was past, what was present, what was dream and what was reality because the author set it up in such a way that everything becomes a slow reveal. I love a good mystery and while this is not a mystery in the traditional sense of \"whodunit\", it is a very mysterious book, full of hints and teases. However, I found those hints to be very tiresome at first. So, I put the book down for the night and picked it up the next morning, thumbing through to see if I'd like what was to come, looking for answers to some of the questions that wouldn't leave me alone. I skimmed and found myself sucked into the story so that I would skim a little further still, before fully becoming invested. Finally, after much skimming, I went back and started over, reading passages that I'd missed through my first read, until finally I finished the entire book.I don't normally read books that way but I think the skimming really helped me stick with this book and I am so glad I did. I almost took it back to the library, unfinished! It's a very moving story, though like I said a little confusing at first. I couldn't figure out what this whole Townie vs Cadet vs \"Us\" thing was.

One of the most tragic and sucked-me-right-in openers I've ever read.\"My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?\u201d and my father said, \u201cNarnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn\u2019t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead \u2013 just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, \u201cDidn\u2019t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?\u201dDid I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they\u2019re some kind of garbage, don\u2019t you know?Wonder dies.\"", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["zzza-team", "z2013", "friendship", "contemporary-fiction", "family", "library", "relationships", "young-adult", "zmarch-2013"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1463289529", "review_id": "1463289529", "date": "Dec 08, 2015", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Sarika Patkotwar", "user_url": "/user/show/5547880-sarika-patkotwar", "text": "I am tempted to say that Tanja forced me to read Melina Marchetta's On the Jellicoe Road. I am also tempted to say that she bullied me into reading it. But I won't say it. Because after Tanja read a few books that I recommended her, it was about time that I gave Melina Marchetta, an author Tanja swears by, a try. And trust me, Tanja knows her stuff. Don't ever mess with her. Don't ever doubt her. Because one point that is absolutely clear to me now is that Tanja will recommend books that will make you cry and in the end, those are the best books. It wasn't easy for me to get into Jellicoe Road. The story is confusing as hell, and there were times when I had no idea what I was reading but I just kept reading because, 1) I had to do this for my girl who 2) kept motivating me to go on with it. But even if I didn't have reason number two, I would have still continued reading because Melina Marchetta created magic with her writing and just the flow of words had me wanting to turn the pages. The confusing shift between past and present was difficult to understand at first, but once I got the connection between the two, it became incredible. I guess with books like Jellicoe Road, it's not so much about understanding as it is about feeling. And I felt. I am unable to pinpoint exactly what I felt, but I felt that pull in my heart that made me want to hug the characters. It was towards the last 15% of the book that I really got into the story and started feeling, but that's okay, because those last few chapters were so damn stunning. So even though 85% is huge, I forgive it, because the last bit was where everything came together, all dots were connected and life went on. So to conclude, I will just say that Jellicoe Road is difficult to understand and confusing to read, but you don't you dare give up, because there are very few books that bring tears to your eyes, and this is one of those books. While I do not love this book as much as Tanja and Glass do, I still want to thank them both for making me read it. You girls owe me now. But first, thank you. Thank you for making me read this heart-breaking yet fulfilling story about what matters the most- family and roots. Don't forget to check out Tanja and Glass' reviews of the book.

Ame la forma en que Melina Marchetta localizo esta historia en Australia. La manera en que describe los lugares, por ejemplo: el camino de Jellicoe y el \u00c1rbol de Las Plegarias. Los fragmentos del manuscrito de Hannah, donde se cuentan las historias de Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz y Jude fueron mis partes favoritas del libro.

I loved it from about page 175 or so on. I hadn't read any reviews or summaries before I started, I just bought it because it was on sale and had a pretty cover. Sometimes I do that. Sometimes I find treasure. Sometimes I find trash. I'm willing to take the risk. Having said that, I thought the book was set in the future and was somewhat dystopic when I first began. It wasn't.Taylor, our narrator attends a boarding school and her classmates, \"Townies\" and \"Cadets\" participate in some sort of war. I thought this was an actual war and that there would be dire, possibly even fatal, consequences to these skirmishes. When I finally realized the war was just a game these kids played for six weeks of the year the rest of the story fell into place. I was able to understand what was going on, get to know the characters and realize that the reason the story kept changing, and I often felt lost, was that sprinkled throughout Taylor's story is the story of five other kids in the past. Ah ha!Taylor was abandoned by her mother at the tender age of 11. She has always kept others at arm's length, been hesitant to show emotion and comes across as a bit of a bad ass. At 14 she attempts to run away from the school and find her mom. Her path and a young boy's, Jonah, meet up and their journey ends in what she feels is his betrayal. He calls home for someone to come and get them just before they reach where she thinks she needs to search. She doesn't know the true reasons he makes the call and when she and Jonah encounter each other three years later she has a hard time dealing with it. The story is about the loss of, and eventual reunion of, family. About establishing roots and knowing the history those that came before you. There's also romance, and praise the Lord, hallelujah, it's a healthy romance between teenagers. Marchetta writes these teens as difficult, angst-y, rude, snarky and touchy. In other words just like the teenagers I live with. They are not manipulative, overbearing, physically or mentally abusive and they allow each other to be who they are without attempts to change that or rule over each other's lives.I enjoyed the last part of the book so much(once I figured it out) that I may need to go back and reread.

The first chunk of the book introduces Taylor. She pushes people away, is more interested in being alone than not and, in fact, rarely pays attention to anyone who happens to be around. Sound like it might be boring to read? It kinda was. It\u2019s disjointed with little dialogue and the protagonist doesn\u2019t go out of her way to endear herself to the reader. But it\u2019s all in such a way that made me wonder why.And then it picks up. When a leadership position falls into her lap, Taylor takes it on grudgingly. She doesn\u2019t rely on anyone and definitely doesn\u2019t want to be relied upon, but the alternative means falling under someone else\u2019s rule. The stories that she\u2019s never understood from her past confront her more and more as she\u2019s forced to work with others. It\u2019s a little heartbreaking when Taylor doesn\u2019t seem to notice that others need her as much as she needs them. During all the time that she\u2019s thought she never had family, it\u2019s revealed to have been quietly and steadily building itself up around her. It snuck up on me. Suddenly I was enmeshed in the lives of these characters and I was glad that they belonged to me for a little while. The story doesn\u2019t rush in revealing itself and the confusion becomes alluring. It\u2019s almost morbidly fascinating how one tragedy can snowball and affect so many lives. I love the idea that you create your own family, and that people can belong to each other in so many ways and for so many reasons.

First off, a large portion of the beginning I listened to the audio version. I wouldn't recommend this. The reason for that is definitely not because the reader was bad, as a matter of fact she was excellent but there are quite a few instances where Taylor is reading Hannah's novel and it's extremely hard to follow. In the book, these parts are indicated by italic print, making it obvious it is not Taylor's narration that is on center stage. In the audio version until you know there even IS a novel that Taylor is reading, it makes a confusing scenario even more so. So much happened, so much information was provided at the beginning of the book... but while I was reading those parts, I was too busy saying to myself; What the hell is going on here??? That maybe I could have paid much closer attention and gotten more out of it. There were so many \"A Haaaa\" and \"Holy shit\" moments later in the book that I felt like I robbed myself a little by not paying closer attention earlier on in my reading. I think as many \"a haas\" as I got out of it, I still missed quite a few of them. I rated this book 4 stars which to me is a good book. The only reason it didn't rate 5 stars or an \"excellent\" read was because it took so freaking long to get into it. I seriously was hanging on by my finger nails and the encouragement of my GR friends that the book was worth sticking out. It totally was. It's going to make me double think the next time I DNF a book.

My only problem with books being adapted into a movie is that I hope they can capture the chemistry between all the characters.My only issue with this book (other than the confusing beginning, which made sense by the end) was the mystery behind Taylor's background and who her father was. I slowly guessed what was going on, which if you've read my reviews before you will know I hate when I guess things before they are revealed.

Well, it surprised me anyway. I'd heard that it was good but that it wasn't everyone's favorite of books. But I LOVED this book. My one critique was that the beginning was hard to follow. Marchetta jumps right into the story without explaining much of the backstory or who the characters are. So it takes a few chapters to get into the groove of the story. But as you read, you learn not only how she has formatted the story, but begin to unravel the mystery that is the backstory of the characters. She drops you into the middle because she wants you to discover the beginning. The way she weaved the story together was, in my opinion, brilliant. It made a contemporary story into a mystery. And I really enjoyed how the once sworn enemies became best friends.I will say that I felt the Territory War was a bit underplayed. It was such a giant priority in the beginning of the novel, and just disintegrated. I expected to have more fights with her other leaders, more \"battles\" for territory, and more war games between the Townies and Cadets. I really loved that everyone became best friends, but the huge war that was so important at the start of the book just wasn't a big deal shortly after.All in all, a wonderful book.

But more than that, the novel explores the back stories of the factions' leaders and the adults around them, thus, unfolding two tragic stories about love, friendship and family. The fight for territories was intriguing, until that storyline got dumped midway (because it has, unfortunately, served its purpose) to focus on Taylor's quest of finding her mother and her guardian, Hannah. It took me a while to catch up with the characters, but it wasn't hard to fall in love with them as soon I got to know them. I love the sexual tension between Taylor and Jonah early in the story, but it fizzled out midway because it got a bit mushy for me at some parts.

It was horribly confusing as it wasn't explained until later on that the story of the five friends happened in the past and was being read from a manuscript in the present.

This, though. This one is something else.I read this book in approximately four hours. How do I know? I started it on my lunch hour, and finished it at 8 pm, and I worked from 12:30-4:30. The four stars is deceptive; I loved the heart of this book. LOVED. This is a terribly sad book. And yet, it avoids Hopeless Town. That's a talented touch. LOVE. Let's get it out of the way now: I have no use at all for the territory wars plot. It seems more like a vehicle to make a book out of what might otherwise have been a short story, or perhaps an extremely clunky reverse parallel plot to the 80s territory wars starting? The main past characters get the brunt of the trauma. (view spoiler)[ Jude reads truest to me. He feels the outsider, and does what he is told regarding not telling Taylor or Jessa who they are or why he is around them because he's afraid Hannah and Tate will push him out otherwise. He handles Hannah with kid gloves because he can't bear to lose her. Hannah I can't quite figure. She is deeply, deeply messed up, and with good reason. To me, I can't see why she doesn't tell Taylor who they both are, but screwed up people do screwed up things, and her fear of losing both Taylor and Tate if she disobeys (how would Tate find out??) Tate's orders probably keeps her silent. And Taylor clearly describes how erratic Hannah's behavior can be with her--Hannah probably can't find her balance point in that relationship, thanks to...well,everything. Good lord, the trauma in the past of Hannah and Jude dwarfs the trauma in Taylor's past, and that takes some doing. (hide spoiler)]Though of course, there's plenty of sadness to go around! Having someone fall to pieces in your arms is a profound experience, and the recognition of that might be one of my favorite things in this book. (view spoiler)[ As Taylor rightly points out to Hannah, that's why things are so intense between Taylor and Jonah. It's also why things are so intense between Jude and Hannah, though they are adults and usually keep it under control--that breakdown after Webb's death happened longer ago, too. Having weirdly intense and fast-moving relationships is something of a thing in YA lit, but Taylor and Jonah have earned it, as far as I'm concerned. They did this thing when they were 14, and three years evidently elapse without them meeting again (still not clear on that; Taylor never mentions letters or phone calls once, which--editor's mistake? And for how easily Jonah appears outside her window, it's difficult to believe he stayed away the intervening two years he was in the vicinity.). Nevertheless, that connection you have with someone you saw emotionally stripped to bone never goes, and once that was out there there's no question of why this has to be so intense:  \"How does Jonah Griggs get to be a ten? He sits on a train with me when we're fourteen and he weeps...self-hatred pouring out of him like blood from a gut wound in a war movie...I am the holder of the grief and pain and guilt and passion of Jonah Griggs and as we sit huddled on the floor of the carriage, he allows me to hold him...he takes hold of my hand and links my fingers with his and I feel someone else's pain for the first time that I can remember.\" Is that angst, or is that just another word for a way that emotional intelligence is born, how intuition can rise? The syntax in this scene (in the book in general, but this scene is the one I have to hand) is so fine: he allows me to hold him; he sits on a train with me. It would be easy to write this scene with slightly different words and lose the meaning of it altogether.  (hide spoiler)] Neither Taylor nor Jonah have connected with people much if at all until this moment, and that's what it's all about. That's the power of this novel. Connection. It's what they both want more of, and don't quite know how to get. There's a lot in this novel that I feel I can't criticize because I haven't lived it. Taylor calling her mother \"Mummy\" after all this. I've watched that parent-child bond go so many ways in my work-world, and it's one of the more mysterious things I've seen. Jonah being as functional as he seems to be, with his history behind him. I have a friend who shares some elements of that history, and he's shockingly functional too. People, we are strange and wondrous beings. And after all the horror that this novel bleeds, all the intensity alternating with the useless border wars non-plot, it still got me, with this: (view spoiler)[ \"He takes her hand and draws her to his side. They don't say anything as they walk with me, but I've been here before, so I know that words aren't needed. I remember love. These two people taught it to me and when I see Hannah lean over and kiss Jessa's sleeping head, I know that for the rest of my life, no matter what, Hannah and Jude are going to be there. Like they always have been. And tomorrow I'll need them more than ever.\" That and when Taylor realizes that when she wants more, she needs to go and get it. Take that power, girl.  (hide spoiler)]On a lighter note, (view spoiler)[the whole exchange about the see-through nightie cracked me up. That was brilliant. Spot-on.  (hide spoiler)]And last but certainly not least, I loved how these characters saw each other through their eyes. That sounds obvious, but when Taylor looks at Griggs on the station platform she sees fear; when Jude looks at Narnie he sees her sorrow, and, later, her seeing everyone they've lost; when Taylor looks at Santangelo she sees his questions. I don't think we do this enough. I'm not talking about lovey-dovey gazing into each others' eyes; I'm talking about what amounts to using your limbic system, what some call intuition. It feels like magic and intuitive people are regarded as mystical, but as Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes so rightly states, \"I didn't know; I saw.\". This book deserved its Printz medal.

If I were prone to dramatics, I could imagine my sighs would have been heard from the boundaries of the school to the town down below.The question begs to be asked, \u201cWhy the flashlights?\u201d Turning on the light next to my bed would have been much less conspicuous and dramatic. But if there is something I have learned in the past five years, it\u2019s that melodrama plays a special part in the lives of those at the Jellicoe School.So, JELLICOE ROAD. This story isn\u2019t quite what I expected. For one thing, there\u2019s a touch of magic in it, though it\u2019s a contemporary YA, not a fantasy novel. For another, it reads very much indeed like a dystopian novel, although it\u2019s not that either. Plus, there\u2019s a definite mystery wrapped around the main story. Here's the back cover copy:Taylor is leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs - the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother - who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.The moving, joyous and brilliantly compelling new novel from the best-selling, multi-award-winning author of Looking for Alibrandi and Saving Francesca.Which is all very well, but as you can see from the opening, the protagonist, Taylor, is dreaming about a boy when the story opens. This particular dream, and others, continues to be important through the story and particularly at the end. This is what I mean by a touch of magic.Also, Jellicoe School? The codified warfare between the students of the school, the townies, and the military cadets who spend a few weeks camping nearby in the summer . . . very dystopian feel to this element of the story. The adults don\u2019t know what the heck is going on, even though the war gets pretty violent at times. No actual fatalities, but if the kids hadn\u2019t gotten this all straightened out, I can hardly see how they would have avoided real trouble eventually.The story is not exactly about sorting out this war thing, though. It\u2019s about Taylor getting her own life in order by working out her relationships to her friends at the school, to Chaz Santangelo (one of the Town kids) and most of all Jonah Griggs (leader of the Cadets). It\u2019s also about Taylor sorting out her relationships with her mother, who abandoned her at the school years ago, and Hannah, who has been more or less acting as a mother to her since.So it\u2019s a relationship story. Obviously. Except it\u2019s really two stories braided together, because the story of what happened to Taylor\u2019s mother and Hannah and their friends seventeen years ago is the frame story and also braided through the current-day story. Working out what happened to that earlier group of friends gives JELLICOE ROAD a definite mystery element as well. So it\u2019s complicated.My overall reaction: It\u2019s a pretty dark story. I, unlike whoever wrote the back cover copy, would not have picked the word \"joyous\" to describe it. What happened seventeen years ago is horrifically grim, and as we find out more about the aftermath, it just gets grimmer. There is a happy ending to that story . . . sort of . . . but the best thing you can say about the contemporary story line is: Taylor and her friends may go through some tough times, but it is *nothing* to what happened to the older generation. And everyone does wind up in a better place at the end than they were in at the beginning, but . . . moving, yes, but joyous?I actually disliked this story at first. I picked it up originally because of Chachic's recommendation, Brandy's comments, and Maureen's review and because the back cover copy sounded interesting. Two of the linked reviews (links now correct; sigh) refer to the confusing beginning. This is true, but it wasn't a problem for me. What was a problem for me is that at the beginning, Taylor is incredibly self-absorbed. I know she was going through a lot, but I really disliked her. Then a friend of hers at the school calls her on that and from that point on, she starts to grow into a much more likeable person. By the end, I liked her a lot. The bit where she tells off Sergeant Santangelo for being angry at his son, Chaz, is one of my favorite scenes. I really enjoyed seeing Taylor grow up and seeing the relationships between her and her friends deepen. Plus, Jonah Griggs! His backstory is *grim*. His background with Taylor is . . . also grim, in unexpected ways. But how he and Taylor figure out what happened in the past and work out their current relationship \u2013 all that is pretty much perfect.So, yeah, by the end, I loved this book.

And it's all Melina Marchetta's fault...Taylor Markham lives at Jellicoe School. She's the head of the school boarders, leading them in a secret military-style battle for territory - in a teen war between the boarders' faction, the Townies and the Cadets that has been going on for generations. Ever since her drug addict mother abandoned her at a 7/11 store a few years back, Taylor has been happy to keep people at arms length. After all, by maintaining a tough exterior, it's easier to hide the hurt. And you can't be abandoned if you don't ever let anyone close enough to abandon you.Yet Taylor feels added responsibility pressing down on her. The disappearance of the closest person to a mother, Hannah, is a betrayal. Before long, however, Taylor moves past her fear of abandonment and worries instead that perhaps Hannah did not disappear of her own accord.Desperate to find her before its too late, Taylor's only clue is a manuscript of Hannah's, holding a story that feels less like fiction and more like a memory. And Taylor starts to wonder...what is it exactly that people are hiding from her? And will she live to find out?***If you can't already guess, this book is ENTIRELY mysterious. I guarantee that unless you have some crystal-ball-prophetic power you will be wondering what the hell is going on with anything for at LEAST the first third (it took me two-thirds, because I'm slower than most).The opening scene in Jellicoe is horribly shocking and angelically beautiful in equal doses. From there the reader is faced with a confusing jumble of people's names and places and actions, with no real way of being able to connect the dots. This is one of the few books where I feel the 100-page rule does not apply, make it 150 pages instead and you'll suddenly understand why I told you to hold on.This book has been called \"distinguished\" by other book bloggers and I would completely agree with the description. Marchetta has a crafty way of writing that is both mature and accessible.But what I feel this author truly excels at is her ability to create authentic teenage emotion. The relationships between these characters are so real - you feel the thrill of the first hand-touch of two (future) lovers, the fond feelings underlying an insult traded between friends, even the absolute desolation a teen feels when they realise their Innocence is being gobbled up by the Experience monster at an alarming rate. \"No one understands us!\", they cry.But you're wrong! Melina understands.I had only read Looking for Alibrandi by Marchetta before reading Jellicoe. I thought Alibrandi was a happy, bright little thing, until the book suddenly smacks you in the face with Death. In comparison, though, Jellicoe feels like a school excursion to the local haunted graveyard. Yep, On the Jellicoe Road is all about the ghosts, baby. Ghosts of the past, ghosts of the future, ghosts in dreams and ghosts in trees - pick your favourite flavour of ghost, they're all there. The book's also got this cool military thing going on - the school feels a bit like army barracks and when you pair this with the smalltown, isolated territory, well, you couldn't be blamed for thinking theres a bit of a dystopian thread running through the story.I could go on for a long time about lessons that can be learned here - the book is about journeys rather than destinations, and there are themes of abandonment, and freedom, and the blame game in abundance. Even better for the peeps out there who love a dash of symbolism - there's allusions to such classics as to Kill a Mockingbird and Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, and it's totally open for reader's interpretation. I'm sorry I can't really give away more of the actual story, and I may have in fact confused you more, but believe me - it's all part of the master plan. And despite the hugely positive review I'm giving this book I have to come clean - I can't give this book five stars.Marchetta may be a whiz at writing, but she's a terrible surgeon. I feel like I've gone under the knife expecting to be dramatically altered yet healed - after all, my favourite authors have such precision! Instead I wake up to find that my brain thinks only of sad things. I want to curl up into the foetal position and never speak to the world again. This book deals with death, and then some. You can't say you haven't been warned!But hey, all in all, I am happy I read it *stifled sob* and I heartily recommend it *sniffle*. It's a fantastic offering from a fantastic writer and I know now that I'll just have to read Saving Francesca - I've heard brilliant things and it appears to be a lot of people's favourites of all of Marchetta's works... High Expectations, here I come!First though, I need a bit of time to get over this one. I'm exhausted.

Basically, there is a girl named Taylor whose prostitute mother abandoned her at a 7-Eleven outlet on Jellicoe Road when she was a child. She goes to Jellicoe School (a boarding school), where the students there are involved in an annual territory war with two other factions of teenagers: the Cadets and the Townies. Once, when she was fourteen, she escaped to try and find her mother, but was found and brought back. In this story, unwanted responsibility is thrust upon her, along with unexpected friendships and a revelation of the past that culminates in a huge storm of a headache and a heartache.Let's begin with the not-so-good so that we can end this on a pleasant note. I felt that the romantic aspects of the book, while portraying a realistic(ish) view of life, served very little purpose. The history that conspires prior to the present setting of this story opens up a world of possibilities that I felt had the capacity to be explored and intertwined with the main story arc, but instead seemed as if it was mostly just there to build sexual tension. Don't get me wrong, it was effective, but didn't contribute much value to the plot. Also, the romance didn't even develop in a very realistic way: in fact, the rate at which it progressed was almost alarming, and I felt that it was just riding on the reader's anticipation to move forward without very much logical flow and sequence (ie. it was pretty obvious from the start who it was always going to be). This, for me, is too great a flaw to ignore in my rating and because of that I've very, very reluctantly knocked it down a star.The good thing is, though, that there is something so magically enticing about this story. A quarter of the way in, I still had no idea what was going on. In the initial pages, the reader is just thrown into a seemingly random segment of Taylor's life with absolutely no introductions to who on earth she is and what kind of system the people there operate on. That's not even counting the bits and pieces of a completely different story chucked in at funny intervals to throw you off. Everything is a blur and it's a chore to piece everything together and get a clearer picture of the whole thing from any bit of contextual knowledge we can get our hands on.But therein lies the magic: the subtlety of the language and the way the plot opens up so gradually is kind of like unfolding a mystery I didn't even know was supposed to exist. It was here that I begun to suspect everything and everyone, and as a result, well... the supposed \"plot twists\" near the end were not very surprising for me. Rather, I thought it was better as a gradual thing, because while the revealing was taking its time, I was busy shivering with anticipation and oh my goodness is this it is that what you're saying no it can't be no it must be but no oh my goodness you can't do this to me noooo, and by the time everything finally converged, I didn't feel sucker-punched. I felt dead.(sorry, I couldn't resist being a little dramatic)Nah, I don't actually feel dead. It's amazing because there is so much hope in the tragedy that is presented. There are sad moments and parts of what is revealed in the end are undeniably tragic and horrible, but there is so much good that's been done and so many lives changed from all these supposed coincidences. In the end, what you get is the reality of mistakes, but at the same time also, the value of friendship and looking forward.------------------------Edit: Wow after reading so many reviews this sounds so shallow and unbelievably lame.

For some reason, Goodreads-less me was unable to cross paths with it when I was closer in age to the protagonist. I had doubts when I first picked it up. It definitely took me at least six chapters or so to get into and want to know more, I'd read that this was the case for other readers so I just kept going with it. And it was worth it. It takes place mostly in small town present Australia, with briefer jumps back in time in the same location. It's as much about the place as it is the people, and the connections you build with both, especially through tragedy. I don't know why, but for a long time I had a strong opposition to reading YA fiction, even as a young(er) adult! When I was the same age as the protag (17) I tried my hardest to not wander into the teen section at Barnes and Noble because I thought I needed to read more serious works (I don't know where this idea came from...). I'm still fighting this weird book snobbery now but on a more subconscious level because I no longer care what people see me reading. (Well, I guess I have one little clue as to my nervousness. I went through a brief manga phase with my best friend in high school early on, and my Dad gave me the same talk his father had given him when he was still reading comics around that age- which is basically that you just can't anymore. To his credit, at the rate I was reading them and then buying more was probably becoming a little too expensive. But it definitely added to the anxiety of my book choices as it took some pushing on my BF's part to get me into manga in the first place! I've since come to realize that though my Dad is well read in his own exclusive non-fiction way, there are many things he won't experience from reading a little bit of everything. And it's taken me a while to see that not only is that okay, it's really good. Yesh, sorry about that extreme digression!) But because reading was usually a private pleasure for me, no one told me that not all YA is fluff. So, here I sit, once again amazed by another technically YA book, and ready for more. This review was more about me than the book I guess... sometimes that happens.  On the Jellicoe Road  has mystery, action and the perfect amount of romance. It made me laugh and cry (quite literally) and I stayed up until two in the morning to finish it. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had an unusually hard time visualizing the world, which is critical for me as a reader. There were brief moments when I could see it perfectly, but Marchetta did not put much time into describing the characters beyond vague descriptions and adjectives. While I do sometimes like to alter the appearances of characters I'm reading about (as a kid Hermione had glasses and you couldn't tell me otherwise), I like a foundation to start with. This also applied to the world in general. She really just jumps right into it without much explanation which can be effective in many cases but I think with this story I would have preferred a little more background. All in all, this book opened my eyes a little wider to the power of YA fiction, and I'm ready for more that also set the bar. Teen aisle at Barnes and Noble, I'm ready for you! I can't wait to gift this to my cousins when they're old enough and make sure they never fret over what people see them read (if I can get them off their ipads, yikes).

It seems I got, in some ways, what I was expecting, but not in the manner in which I expected it. There were place-names that I didn't recognize (although Sydney was at least familiar-in-name); I had some trouble picturing the landscape not because of the lack of description, but rather because I assume it would be different than the stock landscapes in my head; and I kept wanting the characters to speak in an Australian accent, and I couldn't keep that up for long, as I was too \"sucked in\" to the characters and story. These things, however, were not the things that kept it from being a typical YA book. \"I tell him stories. Lots of stories. About the Jellicoe School students and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney. I tell him about the war for territory.\"This book is characterized by two intertwining stories, both of which center on the same geographical location and interrelations among the three \"factions\" represented in the story (the school, the local \"townies,\" and visiting \"cadets\"). While I had to go back a few times to re-read the sections of one of the stories as I began to feel my way through the book, some of the connections started to become clear as I continued. This discomfort with the divergent stories ultimately became satisfying, as they unraveled and converged slowly and naturally. Many iterations of YA literature focus on a single \"misfit\" who ends up saving the world or changing the community. The joy of this story springs from the self-discovery of a number of seemingly normal-and-troubled teenagers, all of whom struggle with reconciling their own identities. Still sounds like a trope, I know... But there's more to it than one might expect from this type of book.The interplay between self-and-origin and self-and-groups leads the main character, along with the people around her, to question where, when, and how identity really develops. Can we be complete if we do not understand where we come from? What are the turning points that make us who we are? Marchetta examines these questions from different viewpoints with a tapestry of answers, highlighting the complexity of being human. With the obvious question of finding out the truth of her parentage and a recently-disappeared parent-figure, the main character finds far more depth of understanding through reading the other story thread, which eventually converges with her own. Through dreams and flashback, this book makes the reader re-examine the glimpses of memory, which are contextualized and reinterpreted through different eyes over time, to seek the truth of SELF. Are we a product of our experiences or the interpretation of those experiences? Can we understand ourselves if we do not understand the motivations of those who have hurt or helped us? Complex but accessible, this book is appropriate for teenagers coming into a realization of identity. It is, however, just as poignant and engaging to a mature reader who may be tired of \"typical\" YA fiction.

I'm not sure if I love the audiobook as much. (text itself, 5 stars, audio, perhaps 4.5?)Melina Marchetta is my favorite author, and this book is the one that really cemented her place as my favorite. To me it represents another level of writing for her. The audiobook in some places enhanced the story, but in others detracted. Mostly because of awkward, dated interstitial music that did not enhance the mood of the story at all, but also, ant this is so stupid of me to say, but because when I'm reading the book to myself I don't always think about how it's set in Australia, but when I'm listening to it being read I can never forget that and it was, it was honestly weird? IDK I'm probably a terrible reader for saying that.Beyond the audio presentation I've never properly written a review for this book, I think because I probably wasn't on Goodreads when I first read it and this is the first re-read I can remember doing.It's not surprising to me at all, having read all of Marchetta's contemporary work, that the theme of family, and especially found and created families, is prominent in this book. It's one of the things I like most about her work. It was also more evident to me on this read through that many of the unexplained pieces of the book would possibly be shuffled vaguely under magical realism by readers.This is not an easy book, and its not a breezy contemporary, but it is a deep look at the people we surround ourselves with, the love we find in this world, and the ways those things shape us.I also really really appreciate that the dangers of a very co-dependent relationship are on display here. It's refreshing to see a book that challenges its protagonist not to make a single person her entire world. It's also nice that the characters are flawed and make very real mistakes, and that their relationships with each other can survive those things.I don't know, maybe it's indulgent to see the self absorption of teens have few negative consequences on the ties binding them to friends, family, and loved ones here? I'm not sure.Also a note, I'm too blinded by my love for this book to genuinely critique it. There are probably problems of representation and plot here but I'm not going to be able to outline them for you, sorry.Edited to add: Re-reading this book was so odd, first, it's been, well I pre-ordered this book and read it immediately after the US release so it's been 7 or so years since I last read it. Many many things stuck with me and the anticipation of them was fascinating, but the how of things being revealed, and the when, that didn't really stick with me.

Browsing the reviews for Jellicoe Road, I was bombarded with 5-star rating after 5-star rating, glowing review after glowing review. I\u2019ll be honest; after all that, the synopsis could have been about a dancing chicken and I would have rushed over to Amazon to order it. (It\u2019s not, don\u2019t worry.)Taylor Markham is a character taken straight out of a Lifetime movie; she doesn\u2019t know her dad and her rarely-sober mother abandons her at a 7-Eleven, sentencing her to a life at a boarding school and guardianship from the one and only adult in her life to ever truly be there for her, Hannah\u2026until she disappears, too. As if that\u2019s not enough to ratchet the melodrama up to a 10, there\u2019s a tragic story of 5 good friends being told simultaneously, one that happened in the past and slowly answers questions about Taylor\u2019s history.The beginning of Jellicoe Road is very confusing, going back-and-forth between both stories with little to no segue, and no idea of how they match up in any way but location. It took me nearly half the book to really get into the story, and those pages were spent terrified I\u2019d be the odd-man-out yet again, shrugging my shoulders at an enormously loved book and stamping my pessimistic, Debby Downer 2 \u2013or \u20133-star rating on it. Thankfully, the second half delivered on all the promises the first half laughed at, and I found myself totally immersed in a heart-wrenching story full of lovable characters, many with huge, realistic flaws.What makes Jellicoe Road work is how it deals with the melodrama it contains. With so many tragic events making up the life of one seventeen year old girl, this could have gone terribly wrong in less capable hands. Marchetta manages to make it believable and relatable, never pushing it over-the-top, or cheapening the subject matter. There are no static characters, no Big Bad Guy or flawless hero. Everyone reacts to and is shaped by the events in their lives. This proves to me once again that the most important thing in a story is its characterization, especially in contemporary novels.This is hard for me to rate because of the completely different opinions I had about the first and second half. Ultimately, though you do realize that the beginning needed to be as slow and confusing as it was to make the rest so powerful, I can\u2019t give this the full 5 stars when it took me so long to begin to enjoy it. I do, however, highly recommend it to readers who like a little more substance to their YA, and don\u2019t mind having their emotions put on a rollercoaster of ups and downs.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2013-reads"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/608757229", "review_id": "608757229", "date": "Feb 24, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Lynn Poppe", "user_url": "/user/show/13410352-lynn-poppe", "text": "If someone asked me to describe the plot of Jelico, I don't think I could.

No one ever explains what's going on* and it's set in an unrealistic and unbelievable high school situation (\"wars\" for territory of trails, buildings, etc between townies, cadets, and the leader of the six houses of a boarding school which in itself seems unlikely and unrealistic) where no one goes to class. Even by the end, you know you need to reread it all to fully get what happened. So, in other words, a perfect candidate for a Printz, no?*Which yes, I get, is the point since Taylor has no damn clue herself but a little background would have made a difference.I didn't like the bits between chapters, even after I figured out what they were and that I shouldn't have been skimming them. Sometimes in a book, these sorts of breaks are nice but here they caused an ugh! and a flipping to see how many pages I had to get through.BUT - and this is an all caps worthy but - by the end, I really liked it.Here's the thing: I was mad at the book but I wanted to keep reading. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but you'll reach a shift where you stop reading just to plow through and start reading because you don't want to put it down. You've just got to be willing to stick with it long enough to make that happen.The massive mystery unwinds slowly but, and you've got to trust me here, it's worth it. There's a large cast of characters to keep track of, but (again after 200 pages) Taylor, Griggs, Raffaela, and Santangelo pull away and you don't feel so lost. Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that while the reading experience is having lots of pieces thrown at you, Marchetta's a good enough writer to hold it all together. A note on stars / recommendation / ages:Firmly between 4-5 stars, if you keep reading. I'd happily reread the second half, no doubtRecommendations are tough.

I'd say 10th on up--not because it's inappropriate for middle school (albeit dark at times in plot and topics) but because it's a text that requires some work and effort to get through.

Taylor has had a rough life and knows very little about her dad and some of her past. I'm actually a little surprised at how little she remembers about her life before age 12, but since I had an ideal childhood compared to her, maybe that's the norm.Griggs is an interesting love interest, especially with what he had to deal with before even showing up at Jellicoe Road. At first he just seems like an intense guy with a bit of an attitude and a thing for Taylor. As you go along, especially near the end, you get to see more and more of the layers. I think I enjoyed his development more than even Taylor's.Chaz, Raffy and Ben are all great side characters. I actually like Ben the best and was a little sad that he's not involved as much as the story goes along. I do appreciate that there was not a love triangle, though.The journal entries by Hannah jump around a lot at first and it makes a lot of the story confusing. Add in Taylor's dreams, it can seem a bit crazy. If you stick with it, I hope you will think it is all worthwhile.

It ended up being an entertaining read and I really liked the characters, but I wasn't as absorbed into the territory wars as I would have liked to have been.Taylor, newly appointed leader of the kids who attend Jellicoe school, was the main character and one that was both intriguing and frustrating. She was going through a lot and trying to deal with it on her own, which led her to passing her responsibilities as leader off on other people.

In the beginning, she is elected as a leader of the \u201cBorders\u201d. She is highly respected in her faction, but is also known to be stubborn and hard to agree with. It is revealed in the beginning that she was abandoned at a 7-eleven bathroom at the age of 11 by her drug-dependent mother. She is picked up by her guardian, Hannah, who brought her to school on the Jellicoe Road where she works. The only memories she can recollect is sitting on a man\u2019s shoulders, what her mom looked like, and a terrible shooting with the Hermit. The second story follows the tale of five teenagers whose friendship stemmed from a tragic accident. The novel continues as relations with the three factions develop, Taylor learns more about her past, and we out what happened with the five teenagers.The two storylines mixed with everyone seeming to have a \u201chistory\u201d with each other was confusing at first, but to those who become stuck on unmotivated- don\u2019t lose heart.

I have to admit, Taylor was not a likeable character at first, but the story gives us insight on her past little by little, and the reader has no choice but to empathize with her. The story comes together in small but dramatic revelations that keep you on your toes. There is a lot about death, despair, anger, hurt, but also love, friendships, hope, and forgiveness.

New story with new people and new places and no word on what happened to the old story. It takes a bit of reading to catch on, and you do, but I thought it was jarring to jump back and forth with no context.We immediately jump into the Townies/Cadets/House wars but we're not told why. Maybe I'm unusual here, but I wanted to know why these 3 groups were fighting over land and taking hostages and literally beating each other up. I may have been able to get into the story more if I had this background information.The plot in itself was quite good, unusual. It set up a lot of questions that I wanted to keep reading to find out the answers to. Like, where is Taylor's mom? Is she dead? If not, why hasn't she come for Taylor? What about her dad? Why are the land wars going on? What happened with Griggs years ago?There were a lot of characters and Marchetta did a decent job of giving them their own personalities. Some of them could have used a little more rounding out, but nothing was a deal breaker.The dialogue was good, quite realistic. There were a few terms or expressions that I had never heard of. I assume they are common in Australia. They were not bothersome and added to the feel of the story.There was no sexy hotness at all, which kind of surprised me, as there were a ton of teenagers living in a boarding school with little adult supervision. But maybe I have a skewed idea of what boarding school is like... There were a few nice kissing scenes, and 1 sex scene that was tentative and sincere.The Sum Up: It took a long time for me to finish reading this one.

It\u2019s a touching story that follows Taylor Markham, whose trying to find the mystery of her mother. Honestly, this book is so darn good that it hurts to read sometimes because it\u2019s so full of wisdom. I love Taylor and being in her head. Although, I wish there was a little more to her grief, I absolutely recommend this book. With the second time reading, everything makes so much more sense. The first time I read it, it was very confusing. Every review you will read about this book will confirm this. Since it\u2019s confusing, some DNF this book, but honestly, I think you should just finish it. It\u2019s such a beautiful journey of Taylor coming to terms with her past and the mystery of Jellicoe Road. I loved all the friendships in here especially the ones between Santangelo and Jonah, although they butt heads most of the time. Their friendship is one of those where they hate each other, but in the end, they both care about the same people. But seriously, the friendship is everything in this novel. Everything about this book felt so deep, alive and rich.And of course, JONAH. He is the best thing in this novel. SERIOUSLY. I own both the ebook and the physical copy and you wouldn\u2019t believe how much I highlighted Jonah\u2019s dialogue. He is perfect. One of the best male interests ever. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to marry this guy. He comes off a cold, stand-offish kind of guy, but he\u2019s really sweet and caring towards Taylor. And uggghhh, he\u2019s the definition of bae. I absolutely loved reading this time around.

Now seventeen, Taylor's the reluctant leader of her school's underground community, whose annual territory war with the Townies and visiting Cadets has just begun.This year, the Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, and Taylor can't avoid his intense gaze for long. This is the same Jonah that Taylor spent 3 days with while she was running away trying to find her mother, and before the Brigadier finds her, and brings her back to her boarding school.To make matters worse, Hannah, the one adult Taylor trusts, has disappeared, and nobody will tell her where Hannah went.

It interweaves both stories, and they finally come together for a nice ending.Taylor's character has alot of anger issues to deal with, but in reality, she's entitled to them. Her mother, Tate, moved her around so many times as a child, and told her she had different names each place they landed, that when she is finally abandoned at a 7-11, she realizes that she is alone. She can't remember her father, Webb, who died years ago, and who along with Tate, Narnie, Fitz, and Jude (the Brigadier). where the original pransters on campus.Marchetta has interweaven the stories between the two groups; the past, and the present, very well.

It's just written in a way that allows you to really get to know the characters and fall in love with them. I loved the little bits from Hannah's story woven in. We get to see little bits and pieces of these characters while trying to push Taylor forward in life.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years.

The beginning was chaotic and confusing - so many characters to learn and two major story lines being told simultaneously. I had read reviews about this and knew going into it that I would need to try to learn each of the characters for who they were, and to not try immediately to figure out how (or even IF) the stories converged. I think this approach worked out well, though I did find it difficult to keep up with who was who and the little sub-stories that were told within these two main stories. (See, a bit confusing)!However, once I got past the initial 'who's who' feeling, I began to feel deeply connected to this book. I wanted to know how things would unravel. I could see the pieces coming together. I began to see the BRILLIANCE behind Melina Marchetta's writing. Her story-telling technique was spot on. Sure it was slow-going and a little difficult at first, but there's no question why this book won such a prestigious award. Overall, my favorite aspect of the story was how all these random teenagers came together. In each of the story lines there were 5 random kids who really didn't 'belong' together as a group of friends, but against all odds, they became the best of friends. Jonah was probably my favorite character. There was so, so much I wanted to understand about him. I had so many questions and I wanted to know WHY and HOW he would become a main part of the story. This book made me think about the characters when I wasn't reading. It made me try to figure out the plot line. I tried to weave it all together. Read. This. Book.

Everywhere on Jellicoe Road, memories tangle with the present, until you realize that the author has woven a stunning tapestry of generations, families, loves, and friendships that spans years. The connections are amazingly intricate and yet don't stretch belief in the slightest. The emotions felt are raw and real and beautifully human.

There's Taylor's struggles to understand her parents' abandonment, her loving but distant caretaker Hannah, the school kids under her care, and the sharp-edged Cadet named Jonah with whom she shares a history. And there's the story of the five kids who used to live on Jellicoe Road, five kids brought together by a single horrific accident, who loved each other and Jellicoe Road with all their hearts and continue to affect the present in more ways than can be imagined.With so many facets, you'd think there would be things rushed or left unsaid by the end, but the author guides every bit of the story to a pitch-perfect conclusion; not sappy, but so pure and wonderful.

Rough start, smooth finish. This probably had a lot more to do with my frame of mind than the book itself. (I shouldn't start reading books when I'm hungry. Note taken.) I found the first third of the book to be pretty disjointed and confusing. I think that this was for a reason. Taylor is lost and confused, but as the novel goes on, Taylor becomes more certain and sure of herself, and the novel begins tying up loose ends that were quite confusing at the beginning. So, whether it was by design or it was just my hungry head getting confused, the novel does clear up as you go on. 2. The original 5 stole my heart. So the novel opens with a story of a family getting in a car accident. Then, flash forward 22 years, and we meet Taylor. No, Taylor is not in the opening series. But as I found out more about those 5 kids mentioned at the beginning, I began to wish they were my best friends. They are funny, and they really and truly care about each other.

On paper, things started looking up from there. But when you get a shitty start in life, it isn't that easy to trust people, open up to new friendships or allow yourself to fall in love. In  On the Jellicoe Road, Taylor learns how to do all of those things, while fighting a war that isn't a war, and while figuring out how her life is interwoven with that of The Five, a group of friends formed by the worst of circumstances, and torn apart by even shittier ones.On the Jellicoe Road is also a book that had me really confused for the first few chapters. I didn't understand what the whole war was all about. I couldn't discover the purpose of the unchronological flashbacks, and I kept feeling like I was missing something. But about one-third in, things started to make sense and I got caught up in Taylors quest to discover what she is all about. It's one of those books where you'll appreciate the first few messy chapters later on, because everything starts to make sense eventually, and you can feel really smart for figuring it all out. What I loved most about this book is how genuine everything feels. Before On the Jellicoe Road, I only read Marchetta's fantasy novels, so I didn't really know what to expect in this genre. But she definitely owns it. Rich, delightfully flawed characters that you can relate to, even if you're nothing like them, and a setting that makes you feel nostalgic for a place you've never been and will never visit.

I generally try not to give away spoilers, but I'm going to clue you in on part of a spoiler here, because otherwise the first part of the book would be nearly impossible to follow. There are large sections of italics in the first half of the book. This is another story, written by another character in the book (not saying who, although the reader will figure it out quickly). The first half is a bit disjointed at times, which makes sense because the main character, Taylor Markham, isn't sure where she fits in. She finds herself the reluctant leader of a private school dorm, thrust into planning the annual schemes the school puts up against the Cadets and Townies. Taylor's life is shaken further when Hannah, an adult counselor of sorts who lives on the school grounds, vanishes overnight. Taylor's mother abandoned her near the school when she was 11, and the teen always saw Hannah as a mother figure. She is especially worried because of additional reports of young girls going missing. In addition, it seems like Taylor's closest peers and adults know more about her past than she does -- are are reluctant to give her any details. As I said -- the first half of the book is a bit disjointed, but it's not too bad. Things finally get rolling with the confrontations between the teens at the school, the Townies and the Cadets, and the story finds its stride when the students go on vacation.

I think the only way I got through it this time is because I made a commitment to read it, and I am so glad I did. Jellicoe Road is a story about tragedy and triumph, family and friends, hope and loss. It tells the story of two families, the Markham\u2019s and the Schroeder\u2019s, and their lives on the Jellicoe Road. Our primary narrator for the novel is Taylor Markham, who was abandoned by her mother at a 7-eleven on Jellicoe Road when she was 11 years old. As Taylor reluctantly accepts a leadership role at her school and leads the war against the townies and cadets, she also starts down a path of self discovery, where she discovers her own history and who she really is.Nothing in this novel is as it seems and it takes quite a while for the pieces of the puzzle to begin to fall into place. Once you get to that part, though, it becomes nearly impossible to put the book down.

A few months later, I decided to give it another chance and I\u2019m glad I did. This time I was enchanted by Taylor Markham and the almost magical outback world she inhabits.
