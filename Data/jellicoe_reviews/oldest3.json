So, that said, no shock.I thought that there was no reason to care about Taylor. We know little about her for 300 pages, except that she's got mommy fixation. Even in the end, I still didn't care about Taylor nor understand why I should care about her. I felt like the last 100 pages were the best in the book in terms of writing, action, and story. I wish a lot at the start could have been cut OR could have been better fleshed out in terms of character development. I think there were too many characters without any defining features who just became names to me. All of that said, I think this book definitely would have its readers. I think a lot of reluctant readers would have a hard time with this one because it requires reading the whole book. I think it might even require two readings. In terms of writing, Marchetta can paint some nice images for sure. She can also paint quite brutal ones. Sensitive readers might be put off by this one, since it's quite brutal in parts. Alas, the book earns a 3 star because I might, in the future, reread it to see if I missed something. If a book I don't care for a whole lot can compel me to consider rereading, then maybe something's there. I'm not quite sure why this one, out of many other great contenders, achieved the Prinz.

Harper Teen ~Language R, Sexual Content~R Violence~PG-13Jellicoe Road in Austrailia is the main character in this novel about finding who you are and the importance of family relationships. Taylor Markham, age seventeen, is the leader of a house of girls at a boarding school in Austrailia. Each Summer, the boarding school kids participate in territory wars with the Cadets (Summer camp attendees from the military academy in Sydney) and the Townies (kids from the local town.) The novel begins with a flash-back that grabs the reader\u2019s attention immediately, however, when chapter 1 begins it is slightly disorienting and it takes a few pages for the reader to orient themselves in the world of Taylor. There is a mystery embedded in the narrative that may initially cause confusion among readers, but those who stick with the storyline will be highly rewarded. I personally had a hard time wanting to stay with the story but I loved how it all came together. This title won the Michael L. Printz award for 2009. There are 2 sex scenes that are descriptive and sensual but not highly graphic. The swearing is scattered throughout narrative and includes 10-15 \u201cf\u201d and several \u201ca**.\u201d I would recommend letting the public libraries house this one.HS NO Allison Madsen~Youth Services Librarian-SJO Public Librarian", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["teen-reads"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44999717", "review_id": "44999717", "date": "", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sandy", "user_url": "/user/show/1190962-sandy", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/45203893", "review_id": "45203893", "date": "", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Katie", "user_url": "/user/show/1088978-katie", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/45239288", "review_id": "45239288", "date": "Feb 03, 2009", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Alicia", "user_url": "/user/show/1895027-alicia", "text": "why did this win?", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["ya"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/45300290", "review_id": "45300290", "date": "Feb 03, 2009", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Jsexton", "user_url": "/user/show/1587545-jsexton", "text": "Have you ever turned on the radio and its in the middle of a new song and you like the song for all the reasons you like music: rhythm, beat, lyrics, voice... but you really don't know what its about? like any of the songs from sgt.pepper, for example? so you want to listen to it again?

I did like the ending of this book, but don't want to give it away so I'll just say it was very appropriate. The biggest appeal of Jellicoe Road lies in the settings, both past and present, and the vivid description of Jellicoe Road.I think this book may be a bit difficult for young adults, but who am I to say a child cannot handle a book? It just depends what each teen likes in books and if they can follow a confusing book, then I would recommend it to them! The characters are believable, but there are just so many of them to sort out. I would promote this book to teens when doing a unit on Australia. It is a rather historical book that mentions many cities and towns of Australia. To conclude, I understand why this book was nominated as a Printz Book, but it is rather confusing and it would not have received my vote.

This novel is utterly confusing until you get deep into the plot. Once you really realize that there are two stories being told, Taylor's story of her the time when she meets Jonah and forms a deep relationship, and the second is the story of Webb, Tate, Narnie, Fitz and Jude whose lives are interwoven following a tragic accident on Jellicoe Road. What makes the story difficult to follow is the fact that it isn't written in a chronilogical format. The reader, if in a classroom setting, might benefit from keeping notes on the characters or a timeline of events in each character's life. I didn't realize until late in the story that Taylor would meet her mother again, which is the perfect ending to the most confusing story I've read. Making a family tree visual prior to reading in the classroom, would offer meaning for the reader of the families and the conflict that exists. Marchetta deals with so many themes, it will be a long study for the class who takes on this book. The students or the reader will be forced to think about family relationships and roles. The reader will see many examples of friendships, both good and bad, which will lead to issues of loyalty. I also wanted to know more about the parents of these children. What parenting roles are to be modeled or emulated and what parental roles would we like to broach and forget? Children are often forced, too soon, to deal with the harshness life can offer with death's grief and with the possibility of abandonment by parents for whatever reasons. This would be an incredible book to use in order to study relationships. I would have to recommend that the teacher read it several times so as not to miss the many messages twisted into the plot and to be able to guide the reader through the issues creatively. Not an easy read is Jellicoe Road, but a most challenging and interesting one. Still, it is not one I would just pick up for pleasure, I would have to have encouragement or pressure if I were a student today. These are relevant topics in the game of life that all adolescents should embrace. This book may be very difficult for the suffering kid. It wouldn't be possible for the struggling reader.5Q 3P S", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["printz-award-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47853392", "review_id": "47853392", "date": "", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Ethelinde", "user_url": "/user/show/1321663-ethelinde", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47955648", "review_id": "47955648", "date": "Mar 01, 2009", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Caroline", "user_url": "/user/show/76992-caroline", "text": "UPDATED REVIEW FROM JULY 2009: After hearing Melina Marchetta's Printz Award acceptance speech at the ALA Annual Conference, I felt compelled to give it another try.

I enjoyed the parallels that are drawn between Taylor and her group of friends (which includes Jellicoe students, Townies, and a Cadet) and Taylor's parents and their group of friends (which included Jellicoe students, a Townie, and a Cadet) and how Taylor learned about her family's history.

I didn't even get past Chapter 6. But I tried to WANT to read it for almost two weeks before finally giving up today. I'm sure the Printz Award Committee had their reasons for selecting it for this year's winner, but I just couldn't get into the story.

It\u2019s what makes Taylor\u2019s mom turn to drugs so she can forget, what makes her abandon Taylor, what makes Hannah keep a distance from the people she loves, and what eventually brings the survivors back together again.

She could do that without undermining her relationship with her mother, it seemed to me -- indeed, it might even clarify the Hannah-Taylor relationship by better defining the roles. Or why wouldn't she tell Taylor about her dad, her beloved brother? Did Taylor not know her mom's first name was Tate? The Hermit was Fitz, and he shot himself because he felt guilty about shooting Webb, right? And he did it in front of Taylor because she reminded him so much of Webb?Everyone says this is better the second time through, and I can believe that, and I guess I should go back and reread it.

In the end I really did love the story, though it was very sad and tragic in parts. The reason this book wasn't a 4 or 5 star book for me was in the way the plot is set up. At the beginning I found it very confusing. A story told in italics, a bitchy, hateful teenager, and a weird Skulls-esque secret society who are fighting a turf war with no purpose. It took a while for the plot to sort itself out and to get me to care about all the characters, though I did by the end. I also thought there was too much foreshadowing, so by the time Taylor makes her revelations, it's not shocking, it's something that I've figured out chapters before. At the beginning it seemed like that was the point: that Taylor really know the truth but doesn't want to say it aloud, and won't admit she knows until it's completely obvious. I'm not sure if that's what the author intended though.I didn't like the climax. It seemed over the top like the author wanted a big gesture to get her point across, but it made me skeptical (like of course that would happen) especially when the real cause came out. Disappointing, but once all that was over I loved the actual ending. So by the end it all came together and made sense.

At seventeen she attends the Jellicoe School, where 10% of the students are also wards of the state, like her. It's convenient for Taylor, whose caretaker, Hannah, lives right outside school property. At the beginning of her senior year, she finds herself elected not only leader of her dorm, but leader of all the Jellicoe dorms in the Territory Wars in which her school, the Townies and the Cadets (who camp in the local bushland every year) participate. The rules have been passed down year after year in a purple notebook, and Taylor is under pressure to make sure things go smoothly for Jellicoe. However, just as things are getting underway, Hannah leaves without notice, and Taylor's life is in turmoil. She discovers that the manuscript of Hannah's that she's been reading over the years might be more than just a story, and she discovers that the Cadet she claims to have no history with might be more than just a one-time acquaintance. As the leaders of the various groups get closer through the War, they find that there is more to their game than they ever thought, and Taylor discovers that her family history is more complicated and bittersweet than she'd ever imagined.Marchetta's book is beautiful, but stricken with slow pacing that may not catch the attention of many readers. While the snippets of Hannah's manuscript and the peeks at romance certainly make things interesting, the plot doesn't pick up until at least half way through the book, and the Territory Wars are confusing at best until the very end.

At any rate, if you've got a teen who is a very mature and patient reader, you might recommend this to them.

Abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road when she was eleven, Taylor Markham, now seventeen, is finally being confronted with her past. But as the reluctant leader of her boarding school dorm, there isn't a lot of time for introspection. And while Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family, has disappeared, Jonah Griggs is back in town, moody stares and all. In this absorbing story by Melina Marchetta, nothing is as it seems and every clue leads to more questions as Taylor tries to work out the connection between her mother dumping her, Hannah finding her then and her sudden departure now, a mysterious stranger who once whispered something in her ear, a boy in her dreams, five kids who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen years ago, and the maddening and magnetic Jonah Griggs, who knows her better than she thinks he does.

And it's hard for me to know that, and know that it's a Printz winner, and not give it 5 stars myself. But I just couldn't connect with this book. I actually gave up on it, and only picked it up again at the urging of a few friends. The writing is absolutely amazing. I would definitely pick up something else by the author because her writing is wonderful. But the long slog to get to the plot in the beginning, and then the ultimate pay-off, was just too confusing and not worth it. I thought many of the plot points didn't seem to match character motivations, and I wasn't sure why characters were acting that way. I also guessed a few of the issues that were supposed to be surprises. That being said, a lot of the story was compelling and drew me in. I liked how the relationship between the two main characters played out, and I thought Taylor's growth was wonderful. Ultimately, though, I didn't LOVE the book.
