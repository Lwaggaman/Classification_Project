Man, the author is lucky that books don't have hotlines where you can phone in to complain about your lack of customer satisfaction, because I'd be on the line right now, saying, \"Dafuque-ce que c'est?\" Comme \u00e7a.JELLICOE ROAD is an utterly nonsensical book that appears to thrive on its own pretension. Taylor, the main character, spends all of her time either whining or crying, and her biggest claim to fame is that she's in charge of this stupid mock-war her school fights with the locals and the local military school for \"territory.\" If that sounds confusing, don't worry - it's never explained, it doesn't make sense, and it's just as childish and lame as it sounds. Oh, and she's in love with the local bad boy military student who ~betrayed~ her once, many a summer ago.Looped in with this Risk LARPing is the story of some other pretentious kids with ~issues~ who are connected with Taylor's story in a mysterious way. This other POV was incredibly boring and I skimmed it, and yes, the payoff was just as disappointing as I'd imagined it would be, and surprise, surprise, I was able to predict most of it. I'm guessing this is the part of the story that made people shed tears, but mostly I just thought it was lame. And pretentious.I guess if you want to read about the most boring LARP session ever with a tepid love story that makes TWILIGHT seem deep and profound by comparison, read this book.

I started reading this book last week, but I was in a horrible slump, and apparently this book is not the best book to read during one. So, I stopped reading it for a few days while I fixed my slump.

This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book?1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work.3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that.4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO.5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead?Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story \"speaks\" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world. Stop your expansionist plan, please and be content on what you have. Then if you have to test nukes, please don't point it to the Philippines! See, we also love Melina Marchetta!

I read rave reviews from revered Goodreads personalities and got the title from a list of \"must reads\" somewhere in the social media abyss, but unlike some of the reviewers, I found the prose heavy, murky, and droll. The flashbacks/internal thoughts mixed with the actions didn't flow, and I don't need over 300 pages of suffering to sift through it. Taylor didn't compel me to enjoy her character in any way, as she is a brat with a chip on her shoulder despite the advantages normal orphans wouldn't be offered. The worst aspect of all, however, had to be the jargon. I couldn't stand the mention of many artifacts that held no significance to me or any of the characters, like the \"little purple book,\" and I didn't care to read anymore to learn! Instead of intriguing, it was just off-putting, much like how the narration didn't help the reader understand the weird townie vs. boarding school war. It was almost like an idea meant for an elementary audience, but \"beefed up\" to try to make it YA.I don't quit books often. In fact, I only remember quitting two others in the past five years, but I just couldn't go on, and this is someone who is completing a doctorate, has an M.A. in English, reads YA often, and teaches high school.

It\u2019s a joyless and jarring book, with all kinds of ill-fitting elements rammed in together. The first half is mostly about school kids playing a trite game of \u201cterritory wars\u201d in a small Australian town. The author treats the game with extreme seriousness and weight, but in reality it\u2019s a mere trifle. The \u201cwar\u201d only lasts for 6 weeks each year, there are no real consequences for breaching territory, there\u2019s nothing at stake either externally or personally, the teens could easily seek help from their teachers at any time, and the main character, Taylor Markham, isn\u2019t even all that invested in the banal \u201cwar.\u201d Taylor\u2019s got other, more important things to worry about like having been abandoned by her drug addict mother as a child, and having witnessed a man kill himself via a rifle to the head (described with brain chunks and all. Ew!). As a result, the so-called war is little more than a bunch of pathetic, foolish children having hammy, soap opera-style confrontations and saying \u201cYou can\u2019t go there, or else\u2026!\u201d for over a hundred pages. Oh, there\u2019s an occasional punch, but it\u2019s nothing to get worked up about. To make matters worse, eventually even the characters realise how pointless the \u201cwar\u201d is and abandon the entire thing in an anticlimactic whimper. When even the characters think the central plot is boring and meaningless, that\u2019s a sure sign to the author that her book needs to go back to rewrite. Apart from the so-called war, the book also features flashbacks to a group of teens 20 years ago, and explores Taylor\u2019s search for identity and family. The flashbacks aren\u2019t all that successful, chiefly because the past characters experience some serious, serious trauma that makes the present-day story seem even more lightweight and meaningless. For example, one repeated flashback depicts a girl surviving an horrific car crash and watching her mother getting decapitated right before her eyes. (Again, ew! Such exceedingly grotesque images are tonally jarring). How on earth are we supposed to care one iota about Taylor Markham\u2019s schoolyard rivalries after reading that?Taylor Markham\u2019s search for identity is not particularly involving either. Taylor is obviously hurting from the separation from her mother and yearning for some sort of connection \u2013 that\u2019s fine. But Taylor is a histrionic drama queen who reacts to every minor problem in her life by screaming. Emotion-wise, there\u2019s no perceptible difference between Taylor being abandoned by her mother as a child and Taylor having a petty argument with her sorta, kinda boyfriend. Apart from making Taylor unlikeable, this strips all the impact from the actually serious, life-changing events in the book. Moreover, because so much of the book is taken up by the tiresome non-war, everything else is left rushed and underdeveloped. This book is unrealistically over-stuffed with some truly HEAVY topics. Apart from the traumatic car crash and suicide scenes, there\u2019s also paedophilia, child prostitution, homelessness, drug addiction, cancer, mental illness, attempted suicide, accidental death, a fire... But these big events aren't explored with much in the way of depth or subtlety. There simply isn't space in the book for that. Some of these events come across as exploitative, as though they were included simply to shock the reader. Others come across as excessively sentimental melodrama.Not to mention, it\u2019s all incredibly predictable. Like, golly gosh, do you suppose there might be some sort of link between the present and past stories?! Golly gosh, could Taylor Markham\u2019s search for family possibly lead her to the group of teens featured in the flashbacks?! Every time a link is \u201crevealed,\u201d I literally groaned in frustration because it was SO BLOODY OBVIOUS. I wouldn\u2019t usually complain about this, except that the author uses such flimsy, bald-faced plot devices to artificially extend Taylor\u2019s search for her family. Like, Taylor has been cared for by a woman who knows the whole story, but chosen not to say anything for positively no discernible reason. And Taylor discovers a manuscript depicting the events on the teens 20 years ago \u2013 but it is conveniently unfinished and then stolen before she can read it all. Not to mention that Taylor has conveniently forgotten or repressed the memory of every significant event in her life \u2013 until the opportune moment when her memory suddenly returns(!). And isn\u2019t it a tad unbelievable that \nall\n the characters were known by completely different names as teenagers? These contrivances had me rolling my eyes. I just couldn\u2019t become engaged with the story because the way it unfolds was so nonsensical. Oh, and there\u2019s also this totally random serial killer subplot that, unsurprisingly, goes nowhere. That sentence plainly has nothing to do with anything previously mentioned in this paragraph, but the serial killer subplot plainly has nothing to do with anything in this book.The bottom line is this book was an absolute chore to read. I will gladly admit that there are some fleeting, isolated scenes that were dramatically effective and for that reason I can kinda understand why some readers absolutely love this book. For example, there's what might be the perfect teen sex scene - a scene that manages to be both emotionally intense but also painfully realistic. But for me there was just too much padding in this book for me to give it anything other than a 1 out of 5.

Without the blurb, I would not have had a clue what is going on. This scene threw me off: a panel of senior students from a boarding school discussing territorial rights with the leaders of the local school kids and a neighbouring military school. In fact, the council is about access to waterways - as if any of them had any actual claim to the land. This territorial dispute is never even properly explained. The novel seems to have two main characters. On the one hand, there is Taylor, now 17 [I will never understand the trend to upgrade occupations into female first names], who at 11 was abandoned by her mother at a petrol station, and at 14 tried to run away from said boarding school to find her mother. On the run, she somehow fraternized with Jonah, a \"Cadet\" and now her antagonist. However, this backstory is structured as one big secret with only morsels of information thrown in. Taylor is also a particularly mopey, unappealing character. Yawn. Then there is Hannah, a woman in her 30s who survived a car crash as a child. She lives on the school premises and is Taylor\u2019s friend. Somehow she is a main character, even though she has been missing since page 1. Again, lots of mysterious hints.

I listened to this book on audio, so I would like to think that it might have made more sense if I had read it, but probably not.Like many other reviewers, I found the first third of the book to be extremely confusing. There are \"border wars\" between the kids from the Jellicoe school, the townies, and the cadets. For the longest time I couldn't decipher if these wars were serious and spoke to the setting, or if they were just child's play. When it became evident that the adults in the story didn't know about the border wars, I stopped caring because the border wars were obviously just some added element that didn't really serve a purpose or move the plot forward. Next was the \"manuscript\" that the chapters alternate back and forth between. This did not translate well into the audio book at all and for the record, THERE WERE TOO MANY DAMN CHARACTERS. I couldn't keep track of all the kids in the manuscript and all the kids in present tense. It seemed to me that the manuscript gave Taylor (MC) an omniscient advantage, but then at the same time, how could she not realize that the kids from the manuscript were related to her, especially when she seemed to know so much about them. Learning about these characters via their pasts just didn't work well--there was too much of a disconnect.And the hermit. Once we find out who he is, there's still no explanation as to why he shot himself (with a shotgun--is that possible?) right in front of Taylor. Again, this element was just a sensational idea that served no purpose.I think the take away from this book is that connections are important, family or otherwise, but the message was overshadowed with so many other frivolous happenings and dead end ideas.
