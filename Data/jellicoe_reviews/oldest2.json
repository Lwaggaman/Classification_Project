Abandoned by her mother six years ago, she lives at the Jellicoe School and has no knowledge of her family. As the story slowly unravels, Taylor learns about her past and the origins of the war games that kids at the Jellicoe School play with the Townies and the Cadets. There are two story lines - Taylor's present day struggle to figure out her family situation and find herself, and the story of what happened on Jellicoe Road 20-odd years ago. It's a complex novel and there's a lot to like about it. There's a nice romance and some really great characters. The first half of the book was confusing and frustrating and I would have put it down if I weren't urged to finish it by my fellow Cybils panelists. Eventually everything gets explained, but for me it took too long for everything to come together and the book was too long overall. Lots of people have loved this book, but for me the resolution wasn't worth the frustration in the first half.

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic?

On the one hand, if they are done right, the story hooks you, and makes you need to know how the disparate scenes are connected, and how they got to be what you're seeing. Those kinds of stories are fantastic. On the other hand, there are stories like [On the] Jellicoe Road, which just plop you down in the middle of everything - present, past, dreams, etc - with everything melding together and creating this surreal stew, which leaves the reader utterly confused until such a time as the author decides to, I dunno, introduce a character mid-way through the book. This is the type of book that requires a patient reader... and a patient reader I am not. I tried starting this book on my Nook several times, and I just could not get into it. The opening line is fantastic, and the prologue always hooked me with a promise of this book being the kind that would speak to me in emotional terms... but then the book proper would lose me... every single time. It's just too jumbled, and the abrupt shifts of main character (which I didn't even realize until attempt #4 at starting this), perspectives and scenes just threw me off and I'd move to something less confusing... promising myself that another time I'd try again with Jellicoe. Then this book ended up being my real life bookclub book, and I determined to push through and actually finish it, because I'm determined to finish all of the bookclub books. But still I found it hard to actually READ this book. Maybe it was the formatting of my Nook copy, which is very... free-verseish? Not sure if this is how the actual book is or if there's a problem with my copy, but it was extremely distracting. So I said screw it and downloaded the audio from Audible. So now I've finished, and well... I don't know. For much of the book I was quite a bit less than impressed, but after the 60% mark the story actually DID start coming together and I was (finally) intrigued to see where it went. But having to trudge through 2/3 of a book in confusion is a LOT to ask of readers, especially (I think) teen and YA readers, which is the target audience. And, personally, I just don't think it was worth it. I think it could have been more coherent and written in a way that doesn't require the reader to have the patience of Job just to get to the part where the STORY starts. And this was especially true of the audio, because with that damn music leading and ending each chapter, it felt like each chapter was a series of individual snapshots rather than a story. Once the past and present storylines finally joined up I was almost fed up waiting for it.That being said, I did enjoy the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and Fitz. I enjoyed the message, that family is found in the most surprising situations and that we never know what the future will hold, so it's best to live and love in the moment. I also felt like this was a story of absolutes, the kind of absolutes that make moving on near to impossible because of the amount of oneself given into another person's care, and how dangerous that can be for the one who gives of themselves that way... you might never be able to be whole again. Not that that lesson was learned by the younger generation though, because even learning of Tate's struggles after loving someone so completely that she's literally incapable of functioning without him, Taylor jumps right onto that bandwagon and goes for the same kind of ride. Fuckin' insta-love.And that's all I'll say about that. I did actually like Jonah though. He was pretty funny, and as a love interest in a YA story, I can say with complete honesty that he's probably one of the most likeable and relatable I've read about in a long, long time. Just a smidge too-good-to-be-true, but at least he wasn't emotionally abusive or controlling or fucking psychotic like is apparently the IN THING in YA these days. So, overall, I was underwhelmed by this story. I wanted it to be great, and I wanted it to really wow me. But it just didn't. There were some great moments, some poignant scenes, and even a little tear may have been jerked toward the end... but then I kept waiting for it to end... and perfect endings were coming and going, and I'm sitting there thinking \"What is she waiting for? END THE STORY.\" I think the book should have ended at the end of Chapter 25. Maybe the epilogue would still be OK, because it doesn't need chapters 26 or 27 to exist. But it just kept going, and that again was an irritation, because it felt a little manipulative. Gotta squeeze out that last little bit of emotion by stretching the Tate & Taylor bit, wrapping up the Hannah & Jude, and the Taylor and Jonah romances, and tying everything with a lovely pink ribbon. There, finally finished. But ugh... I LIKE endings that leave the reader feeling satisfied with a resolution but not locked in with no room for post-read imagination or wonder. So... yeah. I wanted to like this a LOT more than I actually did. But at least I finished it, finally, thanks to Audible and 2x speed.

As I was reading it, I couldn't figure out why. I finished it last night and slept on it. When I woke up this morning, I realized what the problem was. I simply did not like some of the \"younger generation\" main characters ... especially Taylor and Griggs. Both of them seemed very fake and contrived. I especially didn't like Taylor's voice, and she's the narrator! (This books is told in first person from her view.) So, no matter what was going on, I couldn't get away from Taylor. Blech.Except! There are these passages in italics, which you'll soon find out, are in fact excerpts from Hannah's book that she has been writing. Ahh, there I could get some escape from Taylor! I enjoyed Hannah's narration and storytelling. If the entire story had been told in Hannah's voice, with her style of narration, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more. Hannah's passages had sort of a mystical quality to them, and the characters in her book were much more likable than the characters in the \"real life\" world of Taylor and Griggs.Blech! I'm glad the book is over. Taylor became more tolerable toward the end ... but for the first 80% of the book, she was just so terribly annoying. As I would read this book, it was a real effort for me to turn the page. I had no interest in the main characters, in fact I didn't even like them, so ... there were times when I'd ask myself, \"Why am I turning the page?\" And then I would say, \"Ah yes. It's for the book club. OK, I'll keep reading.\" It was just that pointless. I'm glad I finished, only because that means it's all behind me now. I could give it 1 star, but somehow 2 stars for \"it was okay\" feels better. I did kind of like the story of the older generation.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title":

There were quite a few things I liked about it, but the overall story was slow for me, and I coudn't really get into it. However, that is just my opinion, so I am not making any recommendations on this book, positive or negative. I will only list a few personal pros and cons:Pros:- the way that the story of the past and present blend together as the story progresses- the depth of the characters, particulary Jonah Griggs and Taylor Markham. The author alerts you to elements of their past without flat out saying it - letting the reader use more inferencing, which I like.Cons:- the first 100 pages of the book are super confusing, and I almost put the book down. I don't usually give up on books, especially after an investment of 100 pages, but I was that confused at first.- the story didn't hold my interest for a lot of the book, and I felt that I was finishing it just to finish it.

Sometimes, I still feel like crying myself to sleep over The Piper\u2019s Son and Froi of Exiles only improved on the second reading. On the Jellicoe Road is a different animal. The stories of Taylor Markham, Jonah Griggs, Ben Cassidy, Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude never really came together for me. Marchetta does try to fit all the puzzle pieces together in this disjointed novel, but even the best explanation falls flat when the reader doesn\u2019t care about the characters. Of a character driven story. See what I did there.When I\u2019m reading a character driven novel I need to be able to connect with the secondary characters if not with the\u2014unreliable\u2014narrator. Every fragmented scene was merely an anecdote that had happened to someone else, to people I don\u2019t know or wish to meet. It was all so far, far away from me. I\u2019m not talking about the fact that I live in Northern Europe and the author with her characters lives in Australia, I\u2019m talking about the emotional connection that never was. I did not care. On a technical level I can admire what Marchetta was trying to achieve by indulging in non-linear storytelling and I wish there were more books like this\u2014only better\u2014to challenge readers of all ages. The problem is she\u2019s not good enough author to pull it off. Neither was Hal Duncan, come to think of it, no matter what the award committees might think.

have anxiety about writing this review because I am the only person who wasn't bowled over by this. I've been putting this off all day long. I'm not sure why this missed the mark for me when so many others adored it, and I do adore her style, but this just...didn't work. I spent a lot of time being confused and trying to keep the 5 separate in my mind and who was who, and who did what, and why it should matter so much, but it was tiresome. I thought that it was choppy and I wasn't satisfied with the information I was given about anyone. I spent the majority of the book just seeing the words on the page, but there were a couple times I did tear up. I just wanted more of the way she wrote Finnikin of the Rock and Froi of the Exiles so that I could be so immersed in the story that I forgot everything else. I don't know what to say about this really. I'm too tired to put any real effort into it, and since there are nothing but glowing reviews I'm sure it was just me. I plan on reading it again sometime to see if it makes better sense, and maybe I'll be able to connect much stronger to Taylor and Jonah than I did this time around.
