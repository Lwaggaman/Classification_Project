But it was worth it.Melina Marchetta never fails to remind me why she is one of my favourite authors and, in my opinion, this is the best of her books I've read so far. It's very difficult to put into words how I feel about On the Jellicoe Road. All I can say is that my heart has been ripped out and shredded, my throat has sealed up with emotion, and when I finally get some sleep, I get the feeling I'll probably dream about Jonah Griggs.The story is of Taylor Markham, a girl who was abandoned by her mother as a young child and now resides in a boarding school for kids who are troubled, neglected or criminally inclined. Her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. Taylor tries to balance this responsibility with her own worries about Hannah's sudden disappearance and her belief that it is connected to her mother. On top of that, there's her relationship with Jonah Griggs, one of the Cadets and a boy from her past, who knows her a little too much for comfort.This is so much more than a typical YA book. I want to tell everyone to read this, scream praise from the rooftops, and glare with disapproval at the teens in my local library until they drop Halo and pick up these fantastic works of fiction. Saving Francesca, The Piper's Son, On the Jellicoe Road... every book I read seems better than the last. She creates moods that permeate the entire book so even the most simplistic scenes or conversations become deeply emotional, and Melina Marchetta plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. I can't think of a single book that has had me choked up more than this one.And Jonah Griggs, you stole my heart. Though I do think Melina Marchetta could quite easily persuade me to fall in love with a goldfish. Basically this book is everything... beautiful, powerful, tragic without being melodramatic, and I know this wonderfully sad story will stay with me for a very long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",412,default,"['young-adult', '2011', 'contemporary']"

They don't give those to just any book, and when you factor in excellence . . . well, a lot of titles just don't make the cut. But it is clear to me why Melina Marchetta's third tribute to YA literature received a Printz award back in 2009. It is because it is excellent, to the very meaning of the word.If all YA contemporary writers wrote like Marchetta, I doubt I'd play in any other genre playground very often. She writes these beautifully inspirational, relatable, and emotionally-charged novels that seem to affect me in an undescribable way. Some of the passages in Jellicoe Road seem to beat with their own heart:""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.""""'What do you want from me?' he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.""I've always believed that an exceptionally good writer can take you places emotionally that others can't, and, for me, Melina Marchetta is one of those writers. I'm going to end this review here for two reasons: 1) I believe this is the type of book that should be experienced first hand, without much knowledge of the story going in. So, go read it and remember, the beginning is confusing, but plow through it and I promise you won't regret it; 2) I'm tearing up thinking about this story and its characters, so all you'll be getting from me is the aforesaid and this: I love this book and I'm anticipating the day when I can read it again. I highly recommend Jellicoe Road to everyone.Oh, and one more thing: I ♥ Jonah Griggs.",326,default,"['favorites', 'lib-read', 'aussies-rock-my-world', 'g-ya-realistic', 'summer-reads', 'want-to-reread', 'quality-ya-fic']"

But not every will love this book. I will also preface this review by saying that you shouldn't decide whether you belong in group A or group B before you get to page 125 or so. The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial ""wars"" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

Gorgeous*Books like this make me realize just how insignificant words become when attempting to convey raw emotion. On the Jellicoe Road is more than just a book; it is a hauntingly beautiful journey towards an unexpected destination where tragedy and despair become the bridges to the greatest of friendships. 

And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.

This story is told in alternating perspectives set in both past and present which, at first, seem entirely unrelated. But as the mysteries of this plot unravel, they begin to show hints of their glorious connection. If you find yourself confused or frustrated at first, don't give up - you are strategically been fed only pieces to a larger puzzle that will all fit together nicely in the end. The character development in this story is extraordinary; no one is denied the sweetness of redemption and transformation. Seventeen year old Taylor Markham has been living on the Jellicoe Road after being abandoned by her mother at a local 7-11. The school she attends partakes in traditional games of territory wars where Taylor eventually becomes a leader. Taylor is tormented by the grief and uncertainty of her abandonment and keeps herself emotionally distant from others. She has few memories of her childhood, but when her history starts presenting itself she begins a relentless quest for answers. The writing in this story is captivating as it flows methodically from one vivid scene to the next. Taylor's character, as broken as she appears, is actually quite funny in a dry and witty, sarcastic sense - which is my favorite type of humor. I appreciated being able to smile and laugh in the midst of such angst-ridden scenarios. Taylor's love interest, Jonah, is equally damaged and initially comes across as arrogant and crude. But, as their gentle relationship develops, it not only becomes one of the most loving but also one of the most inspiring. 

Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.

 Every single element and occurrence in this book is connected to some larger piece of the story. Everything. Most connections are prominent enough to take your breath away, but then there are those as subtle as whispers, and if you're not careful enough you just may miss them. I was still connecting the dots even after the book was done. The way this author seamlessly executes this perfect union of all that exists though past and present is truly astonishing. Touching messages of hope, love, and determination tugged at me endlessly while reading this book. This story brought me to tears - from being just so deeply moved and so humbly inspired.

Normally these are the books that either horrify me (Unwind, The Handmaid's Tale) or delight me with superb writing (The Queen of Attolia, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks) or awe me with imaginative world building (The Left Hand of Darkness) or make me cry (Before I Die). Jellicoe Road definitely falls into this last ""made-me-weep"" category.Jellicoe Road is the location of a boarding school for kids that are often neglected or with criminal tendencies. Taylor Markham is residing in the school because her mother had abandoned her at the age of 11 at a nearby 7-Eleven. Now Taylor is 17 and unexpectedly selected to be the school's leader in the game of territory wars with the Townies (locals from a tiny neighboring town) and Cadets (who spend several weeks a year in the Australian wilderness). Taylor is not sure she can handle the responsibility. She is uneasy more than ever - her mentor and friend Hannah disappears and Taylor is sure it has something to do with her mother; Jonah Griggs, a Cadet who she has a shared past with, is back and seems to know her all too well; she is plagued by dreams of a young boy who attempts to tell her something. What follows is Taylor's journey through the past and present to uncover the reasons why and how she was abandoned by her mother. As always, it is hard for me to explain what I like about a 5-star book, but I'll try. Melina Marchetta draws characters that are deep, complex, and real. The relationships among them are touching - more than anything I think, this book is about the power of friendship and, boy, there are some magnificent examples of friendship in this book! The book is also about grief, guilt, forgiveness and, of course, love.If I am forced to point out any flaws in this book, I'd say the writing some might find confusing in the beginning. It takes a few pages to figure out what is a dream and what is a page from a story Taylor is reading; what is from present and what is from the past. But soon enough all pieces of the puzzle fall together and you are faced with a deep, meaningful and heartbreaking story. Another thing that might bother readers is that some characters go through a lot of tragic events, sometimes too many. However, the story never becomes overly melodramatic or emotionally manipulative IMO. Jellicoe Road is a remarkable work of YA fiction and rightfully deserves the Printz award it was given in 2009. I have no doubt I will read Marchetta's books in future.",164,default,"['ya', '2010', 'favorites', 'aus-nz', 'printz']"

After all of the glowing reviews for this one, I was prepared to be blown away. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way for me. It ended up being an ""okay"" story for me.My first problem has less to do with the actual story, and more to do with the format that I chose. I listened to the Audible edition and that was a big mistake. The problem didn't stem from the quality of narration, so much as the complexity of the story. There were simply too many moving parts for me to try and keep track of while listening to an audiobook. It is incredibly hard to pull off a book like this in audiobook format and it didn't work for me.I spent hours trying to figure out who the characters were and what the hell was going on. The transitions between characters and time frames was not always obvious, making matters even worse. I must have been hours into the story before I figured out that there were actually two stories playing out -- one in the present and one in the past. Needless to say, I lost a lot of time being utterly confused and unaware of what was going on. By the time I began to piece some things together, I had already missed so many of the ""connections"" and details that it was kind of pointless. When the big reveals came toward the end, they were kind of meaningless to me. I never really connected with the characters or the storyline. I had simply missed too much to play catch-up at that point.The story centers on Taylor Markham, a girl that was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road by her mother at the age of 11. She lives at a boarding school (orphanage???). When the lady that has taken care of her disappears, she is certain that something is amiss. Taylor sets out to find Hannah, or discover what really happened to her. When she runs across a book/journal written by Hannah, she begins to unveil some long-standing secrets. Along with some friends from her school, she has several creepy encounters and a variety of adventures. There is some sort of rivalry described between the two groups of kids...but I was pretty confused so I can't say I ever really grasped what that was about for sure.Overall, this ended up being a middle of the road story for me. I do suspect that I'm not doing this story justice though. I was just too lost for most of the book to take much away from the experience this time around. I do plan to re-read this in the future, because I have some lingering questions. I'm sure they were answered along the way and I just didn't catch it. I definitely won't be listening to the audiobook on my second attempt. This story will require my full attention.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com ",150,default,"['childhood-loves', 'listened-to-audio-version', 'dark-themes', 'forbidden-romance', 'wtf-did-i-just-read', 'shocking-twists']"

This quote belongs to Stephen King, but it describes the soul of Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road perfectly.Jellicoe Road is the story of friendships that form your world, friendships so wonderful that it's easy to fall to pieces when they break. It is the story of abandonment and loss and learning to deal with it. It is the story of love, intense to the extreme with the generous helping of teen angst. In short, it is an excellent example of a good quality YA book, emotional, intense, and lyrical.""I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.""Here's a short spoiler-free synopsis: Taylor Markham was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is now 17, living in Jellicoe School, a boarding school full of state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House (50 girls) and is expected to lead a sixteen-year-old 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids, the 'Townies' and the Cadets who camp out in the area for a couple of months each year. All while having strange dreams and feeling abandoned by her caretaker Hannah. All while reading Hannah's unfinished novel about five teenagers in the 1980s who form very intense friendship bonds after the horrific car accident on Jellicoe Road when they were 11-12 years old.Now, I have to say that not once did I look at this book as a mystery even though it's marketed as such. The central mystery of the story - well, I easily figured it out only a few chapters in, and the rest of the details easily came into light as the story developed. Not much took me by surprise; it was quite predictable, actually. But since the mystery was not why I enjoyed the story, the reading experience was perfectly fine. To use the book's own language, the whole mystery setup was not a trip but a journey. It was never about the resolution but about the emotional journey it took to get there.""I remember asking, ""What is the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,"" and that was the last thing he ever said.""What I loved was the friendships that the 'old five' and the 'new five' have developed throughout the course of their respective stories. My favorite by far was between Taylor and Raffaela, with the developing friendship with annoying but adorable Jessa as a close second. Even though there was a romantic story threatening to take the foreground, it never overshadowed the rest of the story and the friendships, and I'm thankful for that.""This is the best night of my life,"" Raffy says, crying.""Raffy, half our House has burnt down,"" I say wearily. ""We don't have a kitchen.""""Why do you always have to be so pessimistic?"" she asks. ""We can double up in our rooms and have a barbecue every night like the Cadets.""Silently I vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of my life."" I was quite emotionally affected (I'd say 'manipulated' if not for the negative connotation of that word) by the nostalgic atmosphere Marchetta creates here. The nostalgia for the beauty of childhood and adolescence, for the friendships of the kind that you can only have before you reach adulthood, for the safety of childhood (no matter how messed up it can be), for the safe haven of Jellicoe School for the lost and messed up children. I also loved Marchetta's excellent characterization. Her characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, and feel quite real. That is not to say that there's no stereotyping or clichés, but those are kept to the minimum.""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.""As for the voice of the novel - it is very emotional. Please be warned - it is emotional with the generous helping of teen angst. Oh, teen angst! It's on every page, in every sentence - just like it was so overwhelming when you were 16-17. Everything is intense, the tension is palpable, emotions are right on the surface. Reading this book is like experiencing being a teenager you once were. I found it to be a bit of eye-rolling experience initially (thankfully, I'm way out of the adolescence) but eventually the style grew on me and started to feel quite organic. But if you'd rather not deal with overexaggerrated raw teenage emotions - well, be warned and stay away from this story. ""What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.""------------------------------Now, here are the issues that I had with this book that forced me to knock off a star:- The Territory wars. I thought that storyline was limping on both feet. Why all the intensity if the whole thing only takes place for about 2 months each year? Why the whole issue with the Club House when it's only a few weeks when it becomes relevant? Honestly, just setting up a rivalry between the 'factions' would have been enough for the story. (view spoiler)[Especially since about halfway through the story any of that territory stuff becomes completely irrelevant as nobody pays any attention to it anymore (hide spoiler)].- Sometimes the emotional intensity slips into a blatant melodrama. I mean, there was actually a remark on (view spoiler)[how intense Taylor and Jonah's relationship was, which made me feel like I'm reading a Twilight-type love story (hide spoiler)].- The adults in this book (even Taylor remarks on it!). Seriously, what the hell is going on with the adults? (view spoiler)[Hannah and Jude, I'm looking at you! You and your minimal interference into the lives of the children of your best friends! And what's with keeping the parentage of Jessa and Taylor secret? Especially Taylor? I know Hannah promised Tate to not 'mother' Taylor, but what exactly was the reason why she could not tell the abandoned girl that she, Hannah, is her paternal aunt? How would it have hurt Taylor to know that????? (hide spoiler)]- Taylor and Jonah: (view spoiler)[unprotected sex? Not cool. I'm a gynecologist, and I pay attention to these things, and neither Taylor nor Jonah seem to be at the point in their lives when they seem ready to have a kid - which can happen. STDs are also not cool, you know? Chlamydia is not a joke! I wish Melina Marchetta included a condom-buying scene. It may dampen the mood, but would have provided protection and a nod of approval from this Ob/Gyn doc. (hide spoiler)]And yet, despite my adulthood, despite a few eye-rolls, despite the issues that I describe above, I STILL teared up at the end. I think admitting that will TOTALLY ruin my street cred, but oh well. All the above taken into consideration, 4 easy stars.

It's that constant air of enigma and enchantment, that underlying presence of hope mixed with tragedy that draws you in so very thoroughly; all presented without the need for tasteless dramatics, maudlin behavior or overattention to romance.When you can manage making my heart feel so passionately for a person who only exists in whisps of memories throughout the entire course of a novel, I salute you.

Going into this, I did not know that these characters and their stories would stick with me for days, weeks, after. Immediately after finishing this book, I felt like starting it all over again. I think Jellicoe Road is best read if you jump into it blindly. So I'll try not to give too much away in this review. 
“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.”
Since the age of eleven Taylor Markham has been at boarding school. At seventeen she is now the chosen leader of her school's underground activities and is in charge of how they proceed in the annual territory wars against the townies and visiting cadets. Taylor's past is filled with abandonment, grief and pain. When her caretaker at school, Hannah, the only adult she trusts, leaves unexpectedly Taylor has a need to know where Hannah could be and in doing so also finds out other unexpected truths.I know many people did not enjoy this book because of the writing style and the confusion of the first half. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But for me, it was perfection. Yes it was confusing but I love figuring things out. We got passages set in the past, which didn't follow a proper time line. The mystery of not knowing what was going on or how things connected added to my enjoyment. I needed to know how everything fit.“As I walk back to the school on my own, I realise I'm crying. So I go back to the stories I've read about the five and I try to make sense of their lives because in making sense of theirs, I may understand mine.”I really loved the setting. I have never read a book set in Australia before and it was super interesting to read about. This was set around Christmas time which is the summer holidays in Australia. I could totally relate to that as I too live in the southern hemisphere. I am surprised by how quickly I became attached to the characters. Those in the past and present. I wanted them to be happy, to confront their fears and to be together. “Because people with that much spirit frighten the hell out of me. They make me want to be a better person when I know it's not possible.”The side characters were so well fleshed out. And I was just as invested in their stories as I was in Taylor's. Their character growth and development and their own struggles was so beautiful to read. Watching them become more to one another brought me such joy. “But grief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for.”This is a book that I will reread again and again and know that eveytime it will still impact me as it did the first time I read it. I think what also added to my experience was that I read this with a group of besties. We'd text eachother our thoughts and laugh about how much this book was making us cry. I had the best time reading this. A thousand thanks to Fares for suggesting we read one of his favourite books.

This book. -----Note: I’m not sure where the words ‘On the’ went… I’m assuming it’s different for the British version and not that I have a defective copy.Also… while I’m Note-ing: This review will be a lot shorter than other reviews because this book is best read knowing nothing about it. Initial Final Page Thoughts.Breathtaking. I need to listen to the masses more. High Points.JONAH GRIGGS. Sorry, had to get that out there. Taylor Markham= New Soul Sister. Australia. Mystery! Nostalgia. Childhood games. Raff. Beautiful writing. Amazing character development. Heartbreakingly perfect ending. Low Points.When I read books (real books, not Kindle ones because they have the nifty ‘Add Notes/Highlights’ button) I have a pink polka dot notebook that I jot down page numbers, thoughts and quotes in. I know that’s not a radical thing to do because I know a lot of people who do similar things, and as I read this novel I found myself writing down questions that I believed would be answered at the end. Most of them were and everything made sense, but there were two questions that I had that I really wanted to know the answers to. The answers wouldn't really add anything to the story... I'm just nosey.Not that I’m hankering after a sequel because this book was perfect on its own and I think a sequel would be pointless, but I feel like I need to sit Ms Marchetta down and ask her my questions just for some closure. So, if you’re ever in Manchester MM, there’s a caffeinated drink on me!Heroine.I loved loved loved Taylor Markham and from the first page I knew that she was going to be a part of the League of Soul Sisters (along with Vera, Katniss (don’t mention Mockingjay), Viola and The Rat) that I am considering setting up.I’m going to be the ‘funny one’ in this group, obviously, because I lack the coolness, wit, feistiness and the ability to throw a ball in a straight line never mind shoot an arrow. Taylor was the perfect mix of disgruntled moody teenager, spunky heroine and confused young girl. Yes, she can teeter on the edge of being a bitch but I think that’s what I liked about her. She’s flawed and she’s normal and she’s trying to deal with so much I practically encouraged her to be a bit prickly. YA fiction is so full of impossibly perfect heroines that make it so hard to relate to. But I really related to Taylor and her outlook on life and in the time it took me to read this book, I found myself really caring about what happened to her. And I think that’s why a lot of people really love this book. So yeah, Taylor, keep your eye out for the postman because there's an official invitation in the post for you...Love Interest.Oh Jonah. When I heard you described by many a girl as the mysterious loner with a dark and tortured past, I have to admit that alarm bells were going off.There’s something about the word ‘mysterious’ and 'loner' when used to describing boys that triggers an alarming adverse reaction in me (lots of frowning, yawning, skipping of pages, eye-rolling, eye-clawing-out etc).But you, Jonah Griggs, you are my kind of guy and you are allowed your dark and tortured past. I don’t want to say a lot on this subject because if you haven’t read it already then you need to experience JG first hand. But this guy brings the swoon and I have to agree with Taylor on one thing (well, on most things, but this one in particular)… I prefer him in his fatigues. BOOM.Also an honourable mention has to go to Santangelo, with his abs (don’t worry Taylor, I wouldn’t look away either) and Ben, my violinist and his medieval jousting. Hot damn. Theme Tune.Local Boy in the Photograph - Stereophonics. I immediately thought of this song... not just the subject matter but the whole message of the lyrics. Bitter sweet. Angst Scale.9/10. I really don’t want to say anything in this department for fear of spoiling things. But my favourite part of this book was the way past events were interwoven with the present day and how they affected the characters. I found these passages that were filled with innocence, hope, lost youth, impossible situations and, most importantly, the power of best friends so beautiful and captivating. Recommended For.EVERYONE. People who love mystery books. People who are comfortable with having butterflies in their stomach permanent because when JG brings the swoon… sorry, I’ll stop. People who like kick-ass, resourceful and perfectly complex heroines. People who love beautifully written and fantastically paced prose. People who wish they were younger again so they could have adventures in the best tree house in the world… complete with espresso.",99,default,[]

“From this distance everything is so bloody perfect.”
This will not be a proper review, because On the Jellicoe Road turned me into ruins. Quite possibly, my favorite book of the year, because it is so unique and so gut-wrenching and so enrapturing it deserves the title. This book is not merely a reading experience; this book is a journey. One filled with two emotional plotlines, past and present, that overlap in places only to thread themselves together in a masterful and sad, yet agonizingly beautiful story. 

This book is about finding yourself. About hating the world and cursing the universe for forcing you to exist when you're left abandoned by everyone else. About your whole life being a question mark. And about finally opening up to the world and embracing it to the fullest. 
“Hold my hand because I might disappear.”
This book is about love, every kind of love. The one between siblings. The one that's so intense it's everything to you and leaves you dying when that love suddenly stops. The one that's as natural as breathing. The one that you try to bury beneath excuses. And about the love for life, for living, despite it continuously trying to shove you down. 
“It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
This book is about the ugliness of humanity. About serial killers. About drug addiction. About neglected children. About pedophilia and child pornography. About goddamn cancer. About abuse. About suicide. About car accidents. About being parentless. About loss and about death. 
“Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?”
But, I believe, most importantly, this book is about friendships. I cannot find the words to describe how amazing the friendships portrayed in this novel are. They just filled me up with immense joy and plastered smiles on my face and gave me a sense of family. With their banter, their bromance, their love for mischief, their leadership, their honesty, their support for one another and their endless, boundless, eternal love. 

Also, this book is about clever and magical storytelling. About how an author can enthrall you with some words on a page and make you cry like you lost someone dear to you. About how she can twist your heart and make you curse out loud for (fictional) live being so unfair. About how she can give you goosebumps and butterflies in your stomach and sighs and accelerated heartbeats. And this book is about me and how I have fallen in love with its every single character. I love Taylor. I love Jonah. I love Santangelo. I love Raffy. I love Ben. I love Jessa. I love Trini. I even love Chloe P. and Richard and Sam. And I adore Webb and Narnie and Tate and Fitz and Jude. They were the backbone of this book, its essence, its soul. And oh, Fitz, I just want to hug the poor precious boy. And oh, Narnie, I just want to destroy her numbness.And oh, Tate, I just want to hold her hand and be there for her.And oh, Jude, I just want to save him from the heartache. And oh, Webb, I just want to place him in the sky between the stars where he belongs because he is perfection. After I finished reading at 5AM, I kept asking myself: Why haven't I read this sooner? How much can a single person cry in one night? How much can you love a book? What to do with my life now? And so here I am, begging you to read this book if you haven't done so yet. Let it be a journey for you.

Completely, totally fucked up. Everybody in it is fucked up, and living their lives is fucked up, and by the time you're done with it, you're fucked up, but you can't tell because your head is cloudy from all the tears you've shed getting through this fucked-up book. I hate On The Jellicoe Road. I hate books that make me cry, and this book made me want to weep tears of blood for all that lost youth and promise, and the pain of loss and the promise of the future. If somebody had told me how mixed-up and emotional this book was going to make me feel, I would have abandoned it in a corner and floated off to the simple uncomplicated world of supernatural ass-kicking, where nobody dies and even if they do, they rarely stay dead. In the big debate of Saving Francesca versus Jellicoe Road, I would have to pick Jellicoe Road. I liked Francesca better, but that's because it made me laugh and think and smile mistily, but it never, ever, shoved me into the wringer and brought me out feeling like a limp dishcloth. It never made me feel that piercing tender pain you get when you think of things long past that can never be regained. It never made me feel like I was drowning in the lives of people who are so real, it's hard to believe they don't exist and haven't consumed your life. Jellicoe Road is a harsher, deeper read, the sandpaper to Francesca's paint peeler. Undeniably, the writing is brilliant. It's evocative and tender, it makes the emotions in each page almost tangible. The characters are drawn brilliantly too, and despite the fact that over half of the main cast wants to kill themselves at one point or the other, you cannot help but be drawn to them. I loved Taylor and Griggs and Santangelo and Raffy, but my heart got well and truly tangled up with Narnie and Webb and Judd and Tate and Fitz. It's for them that my heart broke, and shattered into a million pieces. The story is told largely from the perspective of Taylor, but it is the ghosts that predominate, that breathe life into the story, ironic as that sounds. This is not a book for people who want a straightforward love story with a dash of drama. This is for people who want to appreciate good writing, and don't mind losing a little bit of themselves between the covers of a book in the process. Oh man, this book is just so seriously Fucked.

I cried way too much, but it was so worth it. Will review tomorrow when I can wrap my head around what to write.*moves ahead a day in time*After sleeping on it, I'm still struggling with how to write a proper review. There are some books which are virtually impossible to explain, and this is one of them. The GR book summary gives no indication what the book is really about, and truth be told, I'm not sure you'd want to know what the book is about before reading it.The first 150 pages or so are completely frustrating and confusing. I knew this ahead of time, but I also knew that just about every single person who has read this has said the exact same thing, yet still gave the book 5 stars. There is a reason for this. The first part of the book is only giving you glimpses of the player's lives and their world. It almost reminded me of one of those movies that you watch in reverse, where the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the end - yet not quite. All I can do is echo the voices of those who prodded me to read the book - DON'T GIVE UP. You will not forget this book. You will not regret reading. It is so worth the read. Keep some tissues handy.As the story unfolds, the author starts giving us a crumb of information, then another, then another. Slowly the pieces of a broken story come together as one revelation follows another in a wave - a very emotional wave at that. Just when you think you've heard it all, more starts to come. Then more, then more. Pay attention to every single character. Just about every person's life is intertwined with the other characters in this story.I'm done trying to prod you to read this. Just read it. You will not be sorry for making the effort. Please, I beg you...battle through the first part of the book (which is confusing) until you get to the part that starts to get into your soul. Let's call this a dare.

I bow to you, Melina Marchetta! When I grow up, I want to be you! (Ok, I might have lost that chance, maybe in a new life then, lol)__________________Full (former) review:It took me 113 days to write a full review.. I counted.

Reading one of Marchetta’s stories should be one of the “10 things to do in your lifetime”. Seriously, this woman is one of the most creative people alive, one of the most amazing writers I came across and I wish I could put into words the awesomeness of this book, but I feel at a loss for words once more.In fact, I should invent a new language with a dictionary full of ways to praise her talent.Because Melina Marchetta doesn’t only write books, she creates entire worlds full of fleshed-out characters and shattering emotions, and after you read about them you feel like you’re the luckiest person in the known Universe and beyond. Because not many people in this world are able to feel what she makes you feel, and not many authors get to create such strong connections between the characters and the reader.I feel like her stories have a soul. Like her characters are living beings trappend into a fantasy world, waiting for us to come and listen to their stories. They seem to breathe through our emotions, and I don’t remember a moment when I didn’t feel something (deep) towards this story and these wonderful characters.Her words sing to me, they reach into the deep core of my own soul, they make me laugh through tears, they break my heart into thousand pieces but they also put it back in together, making it beat in a whole new rhythm, making it love and ache on a different level.Once again, the complexity of the plot left me lightheaded, in awe, even though I knew what was coming my way. It’s been a while since the last time I read this book and I felt it all all over again: the confusion, the despair, the hope, the heartbreak, the happiness. My teary eyes could barely read and I was left breathless too many times to count. I loved EVERYTHING about this book, after all this time it is still my favorite story and I really hope that when (and if) you read this book you will be able to feel just a tiny-tiny part off all these blissful emotions flowing through my heart right now.

THE STORY:How much heartbreak can a heart take?Jellicoe road is a roller coaster, a story meant to break hearts – one about true friendship and love, about forgiveness and salvation, about hope and disappointment, about life and death and everything in between.It simply left me in awe again because there is no tiny detail, there is nothing less important in this story. Everything has value, all words have power – to make you laugh or cry, to dream and hope.. and the real beauty of it is connecting all the threads in this fabulous piece of art.But as heartbreaking and intense as it might be, it is also fun, and I found myself smiling more than once. So don’t go thinking that this is a depressing book, it is not; it has the perfect balance between joy and sadness, between delight and heartbreak – but don’t believe me, see it for yourself!THE CHARACTERS:I can’t put into words how much compassion I felt towards the characters in this story. I don’t think there’s one that didn’t leave an impression on me. Some times they made me laugh (even through tears), some other I just wanted to hold them close to my heart and protect them from all the hurt in their lives.

CONCLUSION:Every time I read “On the Jellicoe Road” it simply takes my breath away.I fall in love with this book all over again, it hits me full strength no matter how well I think I know the story, it makes me smile and cry and sometimes both in the same time, all while I get drunk on the beauty of Marchetta’s words. Pure talent, pure Aussie awesomeness!

1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1390613767,1390613767,2015-09-13,5,Nicole,/user/show/40997852-nicole,"The Reader’s Guide to the Jellicoe Road is a wholly unremarkable review. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many days and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from a countless numbers of experienced readers and researchers. The introduction begins like this: “On the Jellicoe road,” it says, “is good. Really good. You just won’t believe how phenomenally amazingly mind-bogglingly good it is. I mean, you may think it’s confusing up the road, but that’s just normal. Listen…” and so on. (After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that it'll make you cry, laugh, lose hope, love, grieve, hope again, smile, shake, and all kinds of emotions but hate. There's nothing to hate there. Moreover, it gives directions to the best way to read this book and gives some very illogical arguments.) The guide provides the best way to read on the Jellicoe road, it goes something like this:1. know a bit but not much background2. use your brain3. bring a box of tissues It goes even further and explains each point. ➀Taylor’s life and the italic paragraphs intertwine together to deliver a beautiful story. Our MC is not perfect. In fact, there isn't any perfect character in this book but you’ll love all of them. No exceptions.The guide goes a bit off topic so we had to cut the rest of the paragraphs and get back to the actual summary.[…]Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school. Hannah, who works there, found her alone (left in a restaurant) and took her in when she was 11. However, when Hannah disappears leaving Taylor more lost than ever and our MC is selected to lead the territory war against the Townies (people from the town) and the Cadets (military students) her whole life is about to change. It doesn’t end there, the leader of the Cadets is none other than Jonah Griggs with whom she shared an unforgettable history. Her obsession about finding her mother only complicates matters. All of this will change not only her perspective of her life forever but her future as well. ➁ Have fun reading this book, literally. Try to come up with your own theories because believe me when I say I, every word Marchetta writes has a purpose. It’s also not impossible to make correct predications because I did. Make assumptions, link everything, analyze, think, whatever you want. Just don’t sit there waiting for the author to tell you what’s happening. If you don’t, you probably won’t like the book. Things start to make a bit more sense after page 100 and everything will be clear only by the end of the book. So you’ll have a hard time reading On the Jellicoe Road if you try to be only a passive reader. ➂ Happy moments, sad moments, nothing moments, my tears kept running. It was just so emotional and beautiful not in a forced way. Sometimes you feel like the author is telling you: it’s time to cry!! Not here. This book made me want to lay down, curl in ball, and just cry forever. Sure, there are tragedies here but it’s not just that. While the amazing writing style definitely helps, you’ll just feel like you’re a part of the story and not just an outsider who is reading a book. You’ll share the characters joy, sadness, hardships, adventures, friendships, love, and hope, just everything. (Expert from The Reader’s guide to the Jellicoe Roadpage 49372, Section 3b. Entry: the characters.)The best thing about this book is the characters. I mean yes everything about this book is the best thing but these are special. They are so memorable and real that you’ll love each and every one of them. It’s really hard to pick a favorite because you’ll find yourself relating to each person one way or another. You’ll wait with Jude to meet his best friends (who will become yours too but just one sided :p) each September, you’ll share Taylor’s difficulties trying to manage her house, you’ll enjoy the time she spends with her new not so friends, you’ll try so hard to discover the reason behind Hannah’s disappearance, you’ll fall in love with Jonah and Santangelo… You’ll just feel like you’re part of the story and the characters who are flawed and very realistic will make you want to read about their adventures forever. 
A Final Note from the Author:
Read this book. It was hard to review it because I find it hard to review the books I loved. I really think this book should be more popular. Best YA contemporary I've ever read. Melina Marchetta is a genius. On the Jellicoe Road is what I call a 
Contemporary Young-Adult Masterpiece.

I felt like that until I actually went to Walden Pond. Imagine my surprise when some friends and I decided to go for a hike, go for a swim and check out the scenery--we left Boston around 9...and we got there by 9:30. Yeah right, HDT, I could live deliberately in the woods, too, if I knew my transcendentalist cronies would bring me a Cinnabon and some pumpkin ale once in awhile.** Nevertheless, Thoreau’s idea served as the inspiration for Yeats’ poem Lake Isle of Innisfree*** from which Melina Marchetta quotes in this novel. Yeats, who looks a little like Kenneth from 30 Rock, wrote about Innisfree because, to him, it served as an idyllic place where he could always go for peace and solitude. (I find it rather amusing that both Thoreau and Yeats wrote fascinating works about livin’ la vida simple that become so popular. Lesson: If you find a perfect place, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF)But Marchetta's magnificent storytelling was only enhanced by her reference to Yeats' poem. Instead of pounding quotations into your head, like a sad number of authors do, Marchetta only mentioned Innisfree once in passing...but it stuck with me through the rest of the book.I don’t want to go into the plot of this book too deeply, for the point I took away from the book is that we all have those idyllic places we go to in our minds. For some of the characters in this novel, their Innisfree was with family, or with their childhood friends, or even just spending time with one particular person. It doesn't have to be a place at all. No matter how far we get away from those memories, they are always all polished up in our minds like the Hope Diamond when we need to imagine a perfect place in time.Marchetta’s characters, as usual, were intriguing and fleshed out. It is constantly amazing to me that I can read a book and be unable to visualize even the protagonist, while this author is able to give me an extensive cast of characters and I feel like each one of them is someone I know. From Santangelo to Griggs to Raffy to the Brigadier, I understood where they were coming from and could reasonable predict what they would do in a situation. Very rarely was I frustrated with choices that characters made. (view spoiler)[Though I wish Hannah and Jude got together earlier and that they had raised Taylor as mother and father. To deprive her of a childhood that could’ve been better than it was out of loyalty to Tate was, though perhaps understandable, still frustrating. Same for Jessa. (hide spoiler)] I also have no idea how Marchetta can make my heart hurt one moment and make me hysterically laugh the next.I must admit that the territory war aspect of the novel was not my favorite, though I understand its place in the overall story. (view spoiler)[When it all comes to a close, I wonder if next year’s students, Townies, and cadets will see fit to just share the area? (hide spoiler)] The transfer back and forth between Taylor's present day and Hannah's story was rough for the first fourth or so of the book. If you try it and get stuck, please truck through it--it is so worth it.As I knock each of Melina Marchetta’s book off my to-be-read stack, I am a little more sad. When I’m done with them, how long will I have to wait for a new one?*The Wikipedia entry for HDT informs me that he wore a “neckbeard” for many years and insisted many women found it attractive. 1) I never knew that hideousness had a name; and 2) If you are a woman that finds a neckbeard attractive and we are friends on here, just go ahead and defriend me.**He was only 1.5 miles from his homeboy Emerson’s house.***This poem is the shit.EDIT: I listened to the first third or so of this book and read the rest in book form. The audiobook was great but I wanted to read it faster. The only negative for the audiobook was the annoying DMB-type music that played between every chapter and at the beginning and end of every disc.",68,default,"['aussie-ya-is-the-cats-meow', 'young-adult-teen', 'kcls', 'favorites', 'so-good-i-stayed-up-to-read-it', 'read-in-2011', 'reviewed-2011']"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPeople swear by this book; they want to make it their god. Well, if this book is a religion, then I'm an atheist, because there was absolutely nothing in this book I want to believe in. Did we all read the same book? Man, the author is lucky that books don't have hotlines where you can phone in to complain about your lack of customer satisfaction, because I'd be on the line right now, saying, ""Dafuque-ce que c'est?"" Comme ça.JELLICOE ROAD is an utterly nonsensical book that appears to thrive on its own pretension. Taylor, the main character, spends all of her time either whining or crying, and her biggest claim to fame is that she's in charge of this stupid mock-war her school fights with the locals and the local military school for ""territory."" If that sounds confusing, don't worry - it's never explained, it doesn't make sense, and it's just as childish and lame as it sounds. Oh, and she's in love with the local bad boy military student who ~betrayed~ her once, many a summer ago.Looped in with this Risk LARPing is the story of some other pretentious kids with ~issues~ who are connected with Taylor's story in a mysterious way. This other POV was incredibly boring and I skimmed it, and yes, the payoff was just as disappointing as I'd imagined it would be, and surprise, surprise, I was able to predict most of it. I'm guessing this is the part of the story that made people shed tears, but mostly I just thought it was lame. And pretentious.I guess if you want to read about the most boring LARP session ever with a tepid love story that makes TWILIGHT seem deep and profound by comparison, read this book. If you're looking for the profound and live-changing story that was beautifully written and so moving and unique, take me with you, because I finished this book and I didn't find that story.

It’s the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he’s saying, ‘Here I am world, are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?’”Sometimes, guys, simply reading a book once is not enough. You find that reading it a second time offers you a whole other reading experience. Those once slow 100 pages now whiz you by, and you realise it was not the pace that was at fault, but your confusion.You savour it so much more. Make sense of certain references - crush on the plot, characters and writing, and fall in love with Jonah Griggs all over again.It frustrates me so much to know that I can never do this book justice. That so many readers out there have yet to read this beauty. The thing is, somehow, even though I knew what was going to happen, I choked up and laughed like a mad women at the exact same scenes I did the first time around. What made me smile at times was how the little tissues were still there. So many times I would be about to bookmark a certain moment only to realise that it was already bookmarked. I suppose I know myself too well ;)When I approached the last 100 pages I decided to read them outside in the garden. I have never had that urge before, but It was dark outside, silent and soothing in a way that I couldn't imagine it being inside. It felt right to read those last pages alone - in a peaceful surrounding. Yet, like last time, I dreaded that last page, and when it had ended - I closed the book and just allowed my thoughts to take over and savour them, because I knew it would be a long time before any other book would ever make me feel like this again. I took that moment to mourn characters and a world I genuinely felt I had lost - taking some solace in the fact that I would return to them when the feeling of loss became close to unbearable.You know, I can see myself reading this every year, discovering something new every time, loving the characters even more - if that's even possible.Once again I was left with this undeniable ache that made me want to be a part of these characters lives, but I think what bothered me the most, and what really made me feel somewhat of a loss, was knowing that I will never know a Tate, Hannah, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Jonah, Ben, Raffy, Chaz, Jessa, and Taylor. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to something personal every time I turn over that last page, but now I know that's hardly the case.

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it’s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School – Taylor’s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about – mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn’t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor’s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she’s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn’t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic?

I started reading this book last week, but I was in a horrible slump, and apparently this book is not the best book to read during one. So, I stopped reading it for a few days while I fixed my slump. It was basically over beginning of this week and then I picked JelliNOE again two days ago. DID THINGS GET BETTER? NOPE.JelliNOOOOOOOOOE.Guys, please, someone tell me what was happening in this book.

He reads this book!Seriously, I am one of the moderators of The Filipino Group here in Goodreads. This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book?1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work.3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that.4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO.5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead?Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story ""speaks"" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world. Stop your expansionist plan, please and be content on what you have. Then if you have to test nukes, please don't point it to the Philippines! See, we also love Melina Marchetta!

And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall. It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that's objectively wrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:""What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids? Whaaaat?"" But this setting does begin to feel much more appropriate once you get a bit further in.God, everyone in this novel was so intense.Once I started realizing what was going on, who was who, and why certain things were relevant... Damn. My heart was beating so fast while making these discoveries, and they are all individually and magnificently devastating.This is a book that slowly sinks its claws into you, and before you know it you're caught. And once you're caught, there's no getting out until the end.The end broke my heart into so many pieces. I'm still picking them up. Such a wonderfully genuine and heartfelt story, with characters that come walking right out of the pages to meet you.

I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta.On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter ~ I was spellbound. I remember thinking it was beautiful and haunting and funny and so entirely utterly appealing ~ the prose and the mystery and the characters. I guess I did feel a little like: what is going on? But not in a distracting way. It was absorbing and engaging and mesmerising. And entirely unexpected.I LOVED how gorgeously chaotic the story initially felt. I knew NOTHING about it ~ I even wondered if Santangelo would be the love interest in the early days (which quickly flew from my mind as Jonah's (JONAH!) story started unravelling).I LOVE that I knew nothing about it. Not one review, not one opinion. I had my expectations of awesomeness (it was, after all, a Melina Marchetta and I had read (and re-read) her previous two books countless times. Reading it blindly was a stunning experience: I felt like the whole world was just me and the book. That the entire experience was mine. That no one had gone before me. That the story was for me and I was a part of the story. I still feel like that, in a way. I see others discovering it and loving it and I am SO proud of it (as if, somehow, it is mine, haha) ~ but a small part of me feels like it belongs uniquely to me. More to me than anyone else (I know this is a ridiculous sentiment, but I still feel it). I almost feel private about it ~ as if it has become a part of me and talking about is like letting others peek into my soul.That very first time: I read it all in one go. I was shattered and absorbed and breathless and incredulous. I fell in love with the characters and the prose and the setting. I still recall finishing the book and how I felt gutted and euphoric and in awe all at once. Too stunned to cry (even though it would have been lovely to weep), I lay in my bed for an hour, just thinking about it. And then ... I picked it up and started reading it from the beginning all over again. Since then, I have read it every year (sometimes more than once). It has never lost it's magic. It weaves itself deeper into me. It is my own personal cult book <3It seems ridiculous that I have not reviewed my favourite book of all time. I think I just feel entirely too inadequate to be up the the task. I also feel like it is such a part of me that I want to hold it close and not share it with the world. Yet another part of me feels like I could talk about it all day long and never tire of things to say and quotes to quote. This isn't a review, per se. It is me, humbly telling you, that 'On The Jellicoe Road' is my favourite book of all time. It is brilliant and hopeful and ache-y and truly soul-changing. It is the kind of chaotically gorgeous masterpiece that you only ever-so-rarely stumble across. It is perfect in it's brilliance. It radiates life and hope even as it is filled with grief and sorrow.

I’m glad I didn’t because if I had, I wouldn’t have known of a wonderful though devastatingly painful but inspiring story of love, grief and friendship of two different generations but whose lives are intricately connected to one another.  The mystery behind the characters is also one great reason that kept me reading on, wanting to find out the connections among the characters.  The story also relates the different ways by which people process grief through the different characters and by reading the story, it was as if I was grieving with each character. Good thing, like any other process, grief too has an end or at least a point in which the person must move on and the story thankfully ends with the inspiring message of moving on and living and appreciating life the way those whom you’ve lost would want you to.

 ▒ This book. This fucking BOOK. ▒Why is it so special to me? You mean, except from the fact it's written by Marchetta and contains Jonah Griggs in it? Apart from that? Well, what you need to know is that few authors manage to change my perception of myself as a reader. Yet if there's something I learnt this year, that's Melina Marchetta's books are written in a way that makes me want to create a stamp which would say - That says it all. The reason I rarely cry when I read is the fact I hate feeling manipulated. I loathe it when I can see through the author's intentions and I'm pretty sure that's why I never succeeded in finishing The fault in our stars. Melina Marchetta's books show me something I was eager to learn, because even if I knew it deep down inside, I was seeking out the moment I'd unravel all my doubts : No, I'm not a cold-hearted reader. I was just longing for stories which really speak to me, because, never, ever again I want to find myself thinking 'oh, I think I'm supposed to cry right now'. The beauty of her books lies in the surprise they never fail to create in me : I could express it with a single word : suddenly.And that emergence of unexpected feelings? I live for that shit. ▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒Jellicoe road takes us into the life of characters so strongly convinced of the uselessness of their life that we want to fight for them. We want to tear the appearances out, and above all that, we're grateful to Melina Marchetta because her characters are so relatable and real that we can find pieces of ourselves in them. Pieces of our friends. Pieces of our family. Pieces of my heart that broke for Jonah Griggs over and over again. 
""Please don’t be crazy, Taylor,” Griggs whispers, leaning his head against mine. “Please don’t be crazy.” He kisses me, holding my face between his hands, whispering over and over again, “Please"".
 Therefore don't worry if you're confused throughout the 100 first pages, I swear to you, there must surely come a stage when you'll find yourself utterly captivated by Taylor's journey. Moreover, after reading it a second time, I can assure you that this experience was even more emotional and that Marchetta wrapped her plot brilliantly - I noticed some things I couldn't see the first time and WOW. Just WOW. This structure? Incredible. Everything has a sense. Everything has a purpose. Nothing's useless. Nothing. ▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒This is a tale about where we belong. Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it love? Can we stop belonging somewhere? Can we earn the right to belong or is it something we have in our heart no matter what we do? Can we allow somebody else to be our everything? Because what happens, I'm asking I'm yelling, what happens if our everything disappears? *whisper* Do we disappear as well?Now, I don't want to scare you how that's too late? and I can assure you that Jellicoe Road isn't the kind of book that makes your eyes ache all long without never releasing the tension. No. That's just life, you know? So prepare yourself for a ride - you're going to laugh, to be pissed, to be desperate at times, to lose hope and then fight to find it again - You're going to live and feel and smile. 
""Go on, admit it. When he hits the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?""
▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒I don't want to talk about the plot. Damn, I just can't and I'll say only one thing : even if I guessed some parts of the mystery pretty fast, following Taylor and Jonah was an experience I'd have been sad to miss and that captivating and splendorous story will linger in my heart and in my thoughts for a very long time.
You know what you have to do.
 
""I reach the bottom and smash into him with my fists as hard as I can. He falls and I can't believe he goes down that easy, caught off balance.""You care about nothing, you piece of shit!""I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.""Never,"" he tells me in a tone full of ice, ""under-estimate who or what I care for.”
PS : I have a million quotes to write, a million stories about Jonah, Webbs, Tate, Narny, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, Jessa to tell. But I won't. I won't because this is a book which must be savored blind. I won't even if Jonah Griggs is certainly one of the characters I will never forget. Just meet them, and if that's already the case, go reread it. That's even better the second time around, trust me.

The only thing that was blown is my patience.

But for whatever reason you can’t look away, or change the channel, and now an hour has gone by and you’re totally immersed and haven’t moved an inch and you’re like HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD I CANNOT MOVE UNTIL IT’S DONE WHY HAVEN’T I WATCHED THIS SOONER.Yea, that was this book for me.I started it, was lost for like the first 30%, but then when 50% came around, I COULDN’T. FREAKING. STOP. The beginning was a little confusing because the author just kind of throws you into the story with zero background or knowledge of what’s going on. But as the story goes on, little hints and clues and these crazy coincidences start to appear and the whole time you’re like holy shit didn’t this happen before? Wait, is she that girl? OMG IT IS! What does this mean??!?I’m going to try to explain what this story is all about without spoiling anything so if you do happen to pick this up (AND YOU TOTALLY SHOULD) you’ll have a little background.The heroine Taylor – who I would like to point out was such a great complex character - was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road when she was 11. She doesn’t know why but is brought to the Jellicoe School. And at this school, the kids are spread among ‘houses’ (think of a type of sorority/fraternity). Taylor is elected to be the leader of her house and to lead the school’s annual territory wars versus the Townies (the kids who go to I guess what would be equivalent to public school) and the Cadets (kids from a type of military school). And among the wars and fights and negotiations for things like access to biking trails and club houses, etc., Taylor is trying to figure out why her house mother has gone missing, why she dreams of the same boy every night and if he is trying to tell her something, why her mother abandoned her all those years ago, and how it’s all connected.Insert Jonah Griggs. The leader of the Cadets, and the boy who stole the show and my heart. He is without a FREAKING DOUBT what made this story for me. He and Taylor have a history (even though they are supposed to hate each other while the ‘wars’ are going on.) His backstory was absolutely heartbreaking. The romance in this was very subtle but his moments with Taylor were so powerful and romantic and beautiful and had me wanting to cry like a child. All he wants is to help her heal and figure out the mystery of her past.
""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”__“What are you thinking? “I whisper after a while.“That you deserve romance,” he says.
 And this whole book is so much more than the mystery. It’s about love and family and friendship and acceptance and fate and okay I need to stop before I start crying because I really fell in love with this whole thing. I didn’t expect to love this book so much, and just want to SHOUT about how much I did. I love picking up books not knowing where the hell it is all going and just being blown away in the end. And that’s exactly what happened.http://amzn.to/1M7EULA

“It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
Here's the secret recipe to open my floodgates. Treat with care.Hand me a contemporary written by Marchetta, and I'll turn into a tsunami of tears.This review is not going to be as extensive as my usual ones, but please be so kind to check out my co-blogger Chantal's lovely review on our blog 
Every Word A Doorway
.I've avoided On the Jellicoe Road for years tbh. Probably because I had loved Saving Francesca so much in my youth and was scared that no other Marchetta book would ever compare. Finnikin of the Rock certainly couldn't, and I strongly believe Marchetta was born to be a realistic fiction writer, not a creator of fantasy worlds. So then I was at my local book store last winter and Chantal all but forced me to buy this. My history of avoiding this book continued, however, as it sat lonely and misplaced on my shelf. Last week, I finally decided to pick it up. Which brings us to the sobfest that is my broken self after reading this book. 
Saving Francesca
 is still closer to my heart, mainly due to its topics, but On the Jellicoe Road felt quite similar in style with its troubled main character, witty side protagonists, brooding love interest, school setting, and the serious issues it tackles. I adored the characters, especially the main character, as much as I enjoyed the dark humour from the first person POV from which the story was told. Compared to Saving Francesca, this book has a touch of mystery, as snippets of a manuscript appear between chapters, slowly unravelling along with the main character's personal storyline. Marchetta also never sugarcoats a first and/or young love which I value in a genre full of unicorns and rainbows. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because the beginning is too abrupt a start. The first chapter was both confusing and unnerving, making me wonder whether I wanted to continue, and it took me quite some time go become invested in the story thereafter. A smoother introduction would've been required. Besides shattering my heart and then glueing the pieces together again, On the Jellicoe Road brought on a massive flood of nostalgic childhood memories from Australia. Have your characters call a stroll in nature a 'bushwalk', their nightgowns a 'nightie' and each other 'mate', and I'll be a little curled up ball of homesickness. Can I just spread the love for these little shits who warmed my heart? 
""I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs."" Anson Choi feigns surprise. ""What's her name?""""I didn't actually catch her name,"" Griggs continues.""Lily,"" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look.""Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.""""It's Taylor's middle name,"" Raffaela calls back again.Placing Raffaela in the path of an oncoming car becomes one of the major priorities of the next ten seconds of my life.
With their hysterical fits and unexpected violent outbursts coming from gentle characters? 
""Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?""
On the Jellicoe Road is a beautiful book that will move you, grip you, and enchant you with fleshed out characters, an air of mystery, and a touching story. For those of you who enjoyed this book but haven't picked up any other books by Melina Marchetta, I highly recommend Saving Francesca.",43,default,"['mental-health', 'realistic-fiction', '2016-faves']"

I thought about Kintsukoroi long after I read On The Jellicoe Road. You know Kintsukoroi, the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer. Making the piece more beautiful for having been broken. I am not usually given in to melodramatics but this beautiful book evoked a riot of feelings in my ice-box of a heart.On The Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham overlapping with that of another mysterious narrator whose point of view is in italic.Taylor Markham is a leader of one of the houses at the Jellicoe School, her history is riddled with more questions than answers. Unanchored to anyone, or to anything, she feels lost, an outsider to her own story looking in.“Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?”She craves history, and Hannah, her only link to the past, had disappeared without a word. In her quest to find Hannah, with a jumbled and unfinished manuscript as her only clue, Taylor inadvertently comes to grips with the pain of her mother's abandonment and fleeting memories of being loved. While Taylor is finally confronting her past, she is also leading the Jellicoe School in territory wars against the Townie and the Cadets. The Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a boy whom Taylor spent a few eventful days with years ago.I am not fond of young adult books dealing with difficult topics because the teenage angst and drama irk me off, but On The Jellicoe Road is the exception. Of course, with the topics explored in this book, some angst and drama are inevitable, but Melina Marchetta is never heavy handed with them. She writes emotions on levels we, or at least I, understand.“What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.”She can pack one hell of a left hook right in the solar plexus with a single word, a testament of her compelling, lyrical writing. Damn you, Marchetta.The characters are terrific, they are raw, layered and relatable. I wanted to hang-out with Taylor, Jonah, Raffy and Santangelo in the tree-house. I still do, honestly. Taylor is especially complicated. Who wouldn't be, given her situation. The most remarkable thing about Taylor and her narrative is the air of pragmatic self-destructiveness. Like she is always on the verge of spiraling down.“I do keep him at the back of my mind for those times I get me hopes raised about something. So then I can slap myself into reality and remind myself of what happens when you let someone into your sacred space.”...but yeah, read the book if she truly does.The plot ties up neatly in the end and I am more than satisfied with the ending, but it takes some patience to get to the ending. You see, like Kintsukoroi, On The Jellicoe Road starts with broken pieces or fragments of a life, of a story, that may not make sense at first but as the the novel progresses, the pieces will fit and by the end you'll have yourself a beautiful whole story. So do yourself a favor and just let yourself be lost in this gem of a book,don't even back-track. I promise, it pays off in the end.On The Jellicoe Road is a story of friendship, love, forgiveness and grief. It's so much more, but I'll end it at that. I did not cry but that's more on my damaged tear ducts than the book,but okay fine, I admit, it also kind of, well, broke me. Yet somehow I am filled with hope for the characters in the book and for the young adult genre. Melina Marchetta folks, as long as she writes, there'll be good young adult books to read.",43,default,['heartrenders']

What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More…Well, it’s been over twelve hours and I still don’t know how to start to review this book. I thought I gave myself enough time for a better perspective and drier eyes, but hot DAMN I’m crying again! I don’t like to cry, and I don’t do it very often because I can’t stand how it feels. But would I trade the emotional experience of this book for steadier breathes and calmer emotions? Not a chance! I’ll keep the experience of Jellicoe Road thank you very much.Melina Marchetta is a true contender for top YA Novelist of the century. She has a gift that I can’t describe because her stories manage to make me feel emotions that frankly I can’t explain. Her poetic narrative conveys moments of brilliance that do nothing short of take my breath away and not always because I’m sobbing like a baby. But, because I’m so moved by her honest and magical ability of capturing her characters and putting them on stage in a way that makes me lean forward, open my mind and expose my heart. Jellicoe Road owned me for the six plus hours it had my attention and I’ll tell you right now, it’ll own me every year maybe twice a year because there is no way in HALE I’ll put this book on the shelf to collect dust. This story is one I’ll be revisiting multiple times and if anyone wants to journey with me, then grab a page and hold on because you’re in for a ride. Now, I’d be remiss not to mention that the first 100 pages or so had me in a state of blissful confusion, but then this moment happens where the cloud is lifted and you find yourself connecting with every single element this book has to offer. Color me awed. In this story, I had the privilege of meeting Taylor Markham. She was abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven and her story is one of living in a boarding school and being challenged to lead during a time and place where her school faces Townies and Cadets in a power struggle of a long standing territory war. This book is so carefully designed using two tragic moments in time and blending a large cast of characters that take the reader on a journey of loss, grief and ultimate hope. Jellicoe Road is extremely character driven with Taylor & Ben leading the boarding school; Santangelo and the Mullet Brothers representing the townies; and Jonah Griggs and Choi negotiating for the Cadets. There is also a cast of past characters including Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude that have their own story to share, which serves as the catalyst for the territory wars and the tragedy that transcends through to the present. Taylor and Jonah Griggs were a perfect pair. I loved every moment they spent together and every emotion they shared. Wow, if I could bottle those moments up, I’d carry them around with me forever! Okay and I just have to say that Jonah Griggs… Ummmm Wow! Just wow! By the way, you say both Jonah and Griggs… it’s a state of mind… not just a name. I will never forget this character. At first I didn’t like him at all, but then he brought a bucket of water to the game and I knew he was going to tug at my heart strings. Mission accomplished. ~emphatic pointing at self~ I’m a Jonah Griggs fan.Overall, this book is more than a story, it’s truly an experience that shouldn’t be missed. JR grapples with tough subjects as I mentioned before, but in the end there is growth, survival and self revelation. From Taylor Markham I learned that you have the right to want more in life, but if you do, you need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all your might, and when you have it do the best you can with it. Absolutely beautiful!Finally, a huge thank you and hugs to Alexa that has been trying to get me to read this book since May 2010. Yes, I had the receipt in the book and that’s the time stamp. Thanks for asking me out on a book date with the bestEST rec of all time! MUAH! >.<Favorite Quotes Please note, if I listed all of my favorite quotes, I’d be retyping this entire book, so I’ll just mention a few I don’t want to soon forget.""It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you.

Those exact lines were the ones I read a long time ago, on a post on Tumblr, I immediately google them, I wanted to know where they came from. That's how I found this book. I first read it last year in November, I was about 20 pages in on my Kindle; I suddenly stopped, and ordered a physical copy. That's how long it took me to realize that there was something about this book, even if the first chapters were a bit confusing. But do you know what's the best thing about Jellicoe Road? Reading Jellicoe Road for a second time. You can actually appreciate its magnificence. From the writing, to the characters and the story, they compliment each other beautifully, in a way I haven't read before. This is one of those books that you probably won't find, and when you find them and read them, you know it's going to stay with you for the rest of your life. It's one of a kind, unique, uncommon. This book is placed in a genre where the banalities, concurrent stories, uninteresting; insipid characters, and romanticized unhealthy relationships exist in abundance. So I get why this might be underestimated. I know with certainty that I'll read this many times in the future, and I recomend it to you, from the bottom of my heart.",39,default,['favorites']

I actually considered putting Jellicoe Road down. I didn't, though, because I had to have something to read on my breaks and lunches, and my Toni Morrison hold hadn't come in yet. I can't believe, now, that I almost stopped reading this book.The characters are incredibly real and distinct. The emotions are raw, genuine. The interactions between the characters are priceless.

Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”  This was almost a star lower, except for the fact that I could not stop thinking about this book after reading it. That's the mark of a great story.When Taylor is eleven her mother abandons her. At the age of fourteen her only friend betrays her. At the age of seventeen she is selected to be the leader of her school in the annual territory wars versus the Townies and the Cadets. Her mentor Hannah has gone missing leaving Taylor feeling incredibly alone.First off, I want to say I am still a bit conflicted about my rating for one reason. When I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down. But when I put it down.... it remained down until I made myself pick it back up. In the end I binge read the last 200 pages which were excellent. But the confusing beginning definitely took away from the book as a whole. And with the italicized portions, I have a hard time connecting with characters that are from a different perspective unless I know why they matter. Luckily, I knew it would come in, but as a bad reader, I usually skip those parts and I'm glad I didn't.  “Hold my hand because I might disappear.”  Taylor was such an amazing complex character. She was indecisive but not in an annoying way. It was understandable with all of the shit she went through in her life that it would be difficult to trust and love others for her. Once everything came together in the end, it was easy to see why she was so messed up.But the best part for me? Frickin Jonah Griggs. That boy stole my heart more than once, and his tragic story made my heart bleed for him. He was another character that ended up developing really well by the end and I kind of wish there was another book just so we know his future (not that it's a mystery at the end, it's just open).   ""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”   Third best character was Jude. I'd also like a prequel novel giving more detail on him, Narnie, Webb and the others. I felt like there was so much more we as a reader didn't know. So overall I enjoyed this book. I didn't love it, but I can recognize that it's among the better teen literature out there in the world. This is one of those books that doesn't assume the reader is stupid.

I read this book in 2014 but it is still on my favorite shelves because it was really such a beautifully told and emotional story. If you are interested now is a great time to pick it up.It amazes me the way the Malina Marchette can build and intertwine the lives of the people in her story. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, she makes you care about all of them. Not one of them is perfect, each is flawed and they seem so real that it is hard to remember sometimes you are just in the middle of a story. They all have pasts, presents and futures that are never simple, each is rich and you feel like you know them and that maybe you will carry those people around with you forever.
“We were playing Rock, Paper, Scissors,"" she told him once. ""I was paper and she was rock so I lived and she died.”
Sometimes it is as simple as that, one tiny everyday thing will change your life forever. Sometimes one event will bind you to someone or a group of people for the rest of your lives. Jellicoe Road is the story of two such groups of people.The story is told in two parts and although I was a little confused at the beginning it all flushes out beautifully so just ride with it. First there is the story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude and Fitz and how they met and became friends all on the Jellicoe Road. The Second is about Taylor whose mother left her at a 7-11 on the Jellicoe Road seven years ago. Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school and every year for 6 weeks there is a turf war between the Jellicoe School, Town Kids and some Cadets. As the story is revealed little by little you see how everything is connected and you take the journey with Taylor from a girl who was once abandoned, to a girl who finds a home, friends and her place in the world.The writing of the book is so beautiful that I believe I have more marks and highlights in this book than any other I’ve ever read. The story of the 5 kids who met on the Jellicoe road is disastrously beautiful tying in with Taylor’s story “Instinct tells me to go to Hannah's, but she doesn't live there anymore and that's when I realize the major difference between my mother and Hannah. My mother deserted me at the 7-Eleven, hundred of kilometers away from home.Hannah, however, did the unforgivable.She deserted me in our own backyard.”Taylor feels so abandoned and alone, she keeps everyone at a distance because when people get too close that is when she gets hurt the most. That is the lesson her mother taught her. She is so prickly but you honestly want to just protect her character because already at 17 she has been through more than most people go through in a lifetime. As the turf war starts with the Cadet’s and Townies we get to meet a few other characters. Griggs and Taylor have a past of sorts and it seems their journey together might not be over yet. Griggs in a way was just as broken as Taylor, but she helped him in a way she doesn’t even know in a way that will bind them forever.
“He stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”
Every character burns so bright and they all have fantastic dialogue that seems so natural. I love Griggs back story and how he and Taylor originally met. I couldn’t stop reading and even though I flushed out how parts of the stories intertwined together there are still plenty of surprises that I did not see coming. I wanted to wrap Taylor and Griggs together in bubble wrap and protect them from the world. I hoped for many of the other characters and their story lines. I was emotional and even characters that I didn’t think I would forgive for the parts they played in the story Marchetta was able to give me a different view and when you see the whole picture I found empathy and understanding for them. This is a book that the words and the characters will really stick with you. That when not if you read it again you will see all the beauty and hope that lives even through tragedy“When it was over, she gathered him in her arms. And told him the terrible irony of her life.That she had wanted to be dead all those years while her brother had been alive. That had been her sin.And this was her penance.Wanting to live when everyone else seemed dead.”Marchetta is a master at what many authors try to do but most don’t accomplish. She makes you live the story. She doesn’t tell you what happens, she shows you everything, makes you feel it along with the characters. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors of all time.",35,default,"['re-read', 'ya', 'awesome-audio', '4-5-stars']"

""He is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen and it's not about his face, but the life force I can see in him. It's the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he's saying, 'Here I am world, are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?'""
Taylor Markham is the leader of the Jellicoe boarding school's underground community. Her leadership starts just as the territory wars begin with opposing groups, the Townies and the Cadets. Taylor's mind is not focused on the territorial fight to win, for she has discovered that her caregiver Hannah has disappeared without a trace. Taylor is forced, time and again, to deal with the leader of the cadets, Jonah Griggs, and face the history they have together. She must also face the distant memories of her past that are now coming to the surface. But this is just the beginning of the story...Breathtaking, surreal, lyrical, haunting, tragic, and beautiful, this book is truly an art form. When I first started the book, I did find it confusing, but I persevered. Trust me when I say that it will all pay off in the end, as the stories become more clear and the mysteries revealed. There are so many extreme emotions that this book brings out, including grief, and the tragic question as to why every parent is not able to be a healthy, capable, giving parent...they are just trying to survive themselves. The book also inspires such joy and beauty that you can sometimes forget the extreme lows that can happen in life, if just for a short while. The first thing I did when I finished the book was take my almost four year twin boys, and hug them close. My older son was not at home, and will only sometimes let me hug him, only very briefly. The next thing I did was look up some lingering questions I had about the story. I came across a thread that advised that you read this book twice, as there are so many clues and tie-ins that can easily be missed the first time around, and that provide even deeper meaning for the story within a story. This is a brilliant masterpiece, and yes, I started reading it again...

I adore all the characters so much and enjoyed this reread a lot. “You want us to be there tomorrow?” Santangelo asks quietly. I nod. “Done.” I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it.“What are you so sad about?” Santangelo says to me. “We’re going to know him for the rest of our lives.”Reread Sept 2018: I was in the mood to reread another one of my favorites. It’s been three and a half years since I’ve first read Jellicoe Road, so it’s about damn time!Aaaaand this book still has a special place in my heart. Content warnings for: suicide, suicide ideation, drug addiction & drug abuse, child neglect, child abuse, death, grief, mentions of pedophilia, domestic violence, cancer, car crashBuddy read with Chelsea, Jen, Anna, Jennifer and Harriet.5 stars!!This book made me feel things I don't think I've ever felt while reading. It made me feel all the emotions. EVERYTHING. Confusion, annoyance, shock, love, awe, sadness, anger, heartbreak, hope.... Everything! I will need a lot of time to get over this book. It snuck up on me when I least expected it, hooked me and never let me go. 
So why would I want someone to be my everything when one day they might not be around? What will be left of me then?
Wow. This book was so much more than I expected it to be. When I was done, I wanted to start it again because.. just because I needed to experience these feelings again. I can't explain why I loved this book as much as I did, but boy did I love it. “If you weren't driving, I'd kiss you senseless,"" I tell him.He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly.""Not driving any more.”I was hooked from page 1 and that was mostly because I was so confused. The beginning of the book just doesn't make any sense not knowing yet what you'll later find out. So it was mostly the mystery that hooked me, the strangeness of the story, and wanting to understand what was going on. I'd be lying though if I said that the mystery, the not knowing what was happening, didn't frustrate me. Because it did. But for some reason it didn't make me stop reading or made me enjoy the read any less. Honestly, my annoyance just fueled my need to keep reading, to figure out the root of this special, confusing story. 
“Hold my hand because I might disappear.”
Because when I started to understand more and more, it was so worth it for me! This story is just not like anything I've ever read before and I really did love every second of it. The characters are some of my absolute favorites ever. From Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude and Fitz to Taylor, Jonah, Ben, Jessa, Santangelo and Raffy, they are all so special and kind of everything to me. I couldn't get enough of their stories and my heart hurt so much because of what they all had to go through. Their character development was astounding and their dialogue made me laugh and tear up, depending on the topic. I loved every second of it. “He stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”There were so many moments that warmed my heart, so many scenes I just had to highlight and I wish I could share every single one with you, but I had to limit myself to only a few, unfortunately. ""Who do you in believe in?"" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. ""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""I think one of my favorite characters is actually Raffy. Her constant optimism, her faith and loyalty, especially towards Taylor makes her one of the most amazing friends and I have so much love for her. Now that I think about it, there's some quality in every one of the characters that I could rant and fangirl about, but I'm trying to keep this review at least somewhat short, so just know that I love every single one of them in their own weird way. Ben Cassidy everybody:""Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face.""While the beginning was confusing, and huge parts of the middle extremely funny and entertaining, the ending... oh god the ending broke my heart, in the best way possible. Now that I know what was going on in the beginning, I would love to go back and read it again. I'm sure it would be even more heartbreaking to read it (Anna already told me so), but what can I say. I'm a masochist. ""She's the only person who gets away with calling Santangelo a ""little shit"" and once in a while she'll go for the collective and refer to both Griggs and Santangelo as those ""two little shits."" Most of the time the ""two little shits"" take it on the chin but sometimes Santangelo says, ""I'm fucking out of here,"" and his mom warns, ""Don't you dare swear, you little shit.""Seriously, this story is so fucking special and just everything.

It is the kind of book that if 5 is the top rating makes me rethink all my other ratings because if this is a 5, I have some 5 star books that might be 3’s. I haven’t been this passionate about a book since Sempre and although I can pimp that book out to a wider range of people, this book has surpassed it as my favorite YA romance book ( not even sure if YA romance is the right description for it). This is a story of friendship, growing up, hurt, love, losing oneself, finding oneself, there is mystery and it is written in such a different way that it keeps you thinking throughout. For me the main outline of a YA book is to build, build, hit you over the head and then in the end start to make you feel heeled. That is not how this book is handled. I would say this book evolves and unfolds. And as things get unfolded the story has a natural progression that doesn’t feel forced and I was just so sucked into. After a certain point in the book I literally had to take it in chunks. I would read and stop and think about it and gather myself, make a status and get back into it and when I got back into the intensity was right where I left it. This is the story of Jellicoe Road. There are 2 stories going on in this book. The story is told from Taylor’s voice and a story from a manuscript that is separated from the main story in italics. (I would not recommend this book to audio readers because of that fact) The main story is told in the voice of Taylor Markham. She goes to the Jellicoe School which is a state school, made up with many state wards and people who want their children educated in the bush. The story is focused around a war game that is played out between the cadets, Jellicoe students and the townies. We’re kind of thrown into the story and it unfolds as it goes so the beginning can be tad confusing until you figure out what is going on. Taylor gets dumped on Jellicoe road by her mother and is raised by Hannah who Taylor suspects didn’t come by her by accident. With her high school years coming to an end the mystery around her mother starts to consume her and she set out for answers. **Idiot Paragraph** Not part of official review. First of all I almost didn’t read this book. I got it from the library and have had so many library books and buddy reads that this book had been getting shuffled aside. I finished a book in work( I work nightshift ) and opened it to see if I was into the voice. I had no idea what the book was about, NONE. I got it because Catie and Tatiana agreed that it was a 5 star book (more my fantasy go tos) that doesn’t happen often. I scan down my list and there is a wider range of people with the same rating. The only part I remember is Catie saying the beginning was a little confusing but she likes figuring things out. **Idiot part** There is writing in italics and they tell you pretty early on that it is a manuscript that Taylor is reading. Wellll I missed it. I’m like 20% in trying to piece together this story, trying to figure out whether it’s a dream or 5 personalities in her head and boy was I down all kinds of paths. I actually went back and had to reskim the first 20% when the confusion in my head got out of hand.This book gave me chills and although I have welled up on 2 books in the past because of the sadness I felt for the characters this was the first book that I actually had a liquid type substance around the area of my eyes from the pure happiness at times. And that feeling wasn’t just at the end like you feel in many novels after you get to the top and you are finally rewarded there were several throughout the story.In the end there is a mystery, love stories, bonds of lifelong friendships and just a great story that I would recommend to anyone except those that have to have sex in their books. If you need sex keep moving if not read this book now and don’t let it simmer in the TBR pile like I did.",29,default,['favorite']

Me. Just me....alone with a majority of people of who LOVED, ADORED, OBSESSED over this particular novel. And oh, dear God please don't hate me (especially you, my dear, sweet Anna) but.....I couldn't love this book. I tried. I tried so, so, SOOOOOO hard, but, in the end, I never once did I feel myself drawn back to this story. When I put the book down, it was just that-I put it down. It didn't exist beyond when it was in my hands. And I know that's not how it's supposed to feel. ""What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.Gawd, you guys I wanted to love this so hard. As I was tossing and turning on this horrible last Sunday night (the depression of not loving this book was a visceral feeling), I came to a crushing realization: I'd rather be fighting my Sunday night demons (I can NEVER sleep on Sunday nights, but that's neither here nor there...) attempting to sleep even when I knew I couldn't than reading more of this book. And that kept me from sleeping, as well. I repeatedly asked myself, 'What's wrong with me?' 'Why am I the only person who didn't like this?'. And, admittedly, I still hate that I couldn't find much to identify with.Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.I think Marchetta's ideas are so profound, but I just hate how she delivers them. She's lost me in both books I've attempted to read and I think I just need to realize that this author is not for me. It doesn't mean she's not an excellent writer-she is. But, and this is going to sound so harsh, if the only tears I cried were from boredom? There's a problem. Just because a book is beautiful and has poetic writing doesn't mean it can't be boring and....for me....it was boring until like 60%. Even in the end when it was supposed to all tie together, I finally just didn't care. I don't think I would have anyway, honestly. I'm such a bad reader-I really only cared about Jonah and Taylor, and I feel like they hardly had any real, tangible time together.""What's with what you're wearing?"" Griggs asks while we stand outside waiting for the others.""It's pretty hideous, isn't it?"" I say.""Don't force me to look at it,"" he says. ""It's see-through.""That kills the conversation for a couple of seconds.And, I swear this is the last negative section, that's my biggest problem. Why does there have to be so many people on each page? It's confusing, it made it drag, and I didn't get NEAR enough Jonah...at all. And the territory wars-I'm sorry, but how could this be a main plot point??? It was fun at first, and then I was like...please, please, PLEASE stop-they didn't make sense. Or, I just was too far gone to care...again.Though very little worked for me, there were some shining moments. Jonah. Oh my goodness did I love him. He and Taylor together. All of their moments separate from the school were amazing and fun to follow, but it just took so damn long to get there. I loved the way he looked at her and how he was always so protective of her. How he would do anything to make sure she stayed safe. And, most importantly, how they changed each other's lives forever.""You care about nothing, you piece of shit!""I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.""Never,"" he tells me in a tone full of ice, ""underestimate who or what I care for.""Okay, so, I've said my piece and it's clear I'm in the minority-it's clear that everyone thinks all the things I hated are what make an excellent story, so don't take my word for it. Just know, this book is beautiful in it's own right....it's just not the book for me.Anyway...now everyone can fight over my carcass...sorry.

Sometimes I save books that I feel like I will love for when I really need them. I thought this book was going to be one of those books that I would love because it is so loved on Goodreads and it sounds so interesting. Instead of loving it, I really disliked it overall and that is because the first 50% is atrocious. I almost marked it as a DNF at 55% because of how bored I was but I powered on and I was able to finish it. I think I've narrowed down the main problems with the first half. First of all, Marchetta makes the whole land war thing really vague and I was so confused as to what it actually was. I mean how hard is it to say its like a game? I was like ""is this a dystopian novel, what the hell is going on?"" at the start. Marchetta also makes the whole thing really confusing with the two different stories and the time jumps and the dreams vs reality aspect. Instead of being mysterious and cool, I thought it was muddled and boring. Also, I guessed how the whole thing connected correctly and so the whole thing was just a waiting game for me and not like this crazy good revelation. Secondly, Taylor was the other main problem in part one. She was like completely self-absorbed and it felt like she didn't really care about the other characters and she was like really separated from everything that happened around her. This created a disconnect between me and her and me and the other characters (because it was all told from her point of view). And its not even like characters like Taylor are the problem, it was just a problem in this particular book. Basically I thought the first 50% was like a really bad mystery novel because the author clearly tried to be mysterious, she kept dangling things in front of the readers without divulging anything meaningful, I guessed what was going to happen because it was so obvious and Taylor wasn't being completely forthcoming with the readers or herself. The second half was literally like reading a completely different book - Taylor completely changed, the whole tone of the book changed, it was clear and concise, I could connect to the characters and I even felt emotional at bits. If the whole book had had those qualities, this could have been a great book but then I guess there would be a lot less pages. I liked bits of the writing. I thought it was quite easy to read and I could see myself liking one of her other books if the story was different. The romance was annoying. So. Much. Angst! I did not ship it. I mean, what solidified me not shipping it was when Jonah pinned her against a wall, lifting her off the ground in a fit of rage. Relationship goals? I think not. Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I'm in the minority though so if you're reading this review and you haven't read the book, you could read it and love it like the rest of my Goodreads friends. I probably would be open to reading more by Melina Marchetta in the future.------------------------------------""""I'm the same age my father was when he died,"" she told me.

5.5 stars!
After reading “Saving Francesca” and hearing so many good reviews on this book, I had decided to pick up another one of Melina Marchetta’s young adult novels and I came across “Jellicoe Road” (some versions it is called On the Jellicoe Road). “Jellicoe Road” is a Printz Award winning book and I was absolutely blown away by how emotional and exciting this novel really is! Taylor Markham was eleven years old when she was abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road. Now seventeen years old, Taylor is not only the new leader of her boarding school dorm, but she will soon uncover many secrets about her life before she came on Jellicoe Road, especially after her mentor Hannah, suddenly disappears from the school without a word to Taylor. Not only that but Taylor soon meets up with her old sweetheart, Jonah Griggs and she suspects that Jonah knows more about herself then Taylor knows. Now, Taylor must go on a journey to find out the truth about her mother’s abandonment and the whereabouts of Hannah and what she will discover about her true past will change her life forever!Wow…just wow for the umpteenth time. Now, I know that I had mentioned before that I loved reading Saving Francesca and I still love that book, but after reading “Jellicoe Road,” I think that “Jellicoe Road” is a few leagues above “Saving Francesca” in terms of storytelling and character development. I loved the way that Melina Marchetta build up the mystery surrounding Taylor’s past and how it affects her current state. This was probably the main reason why I loved reading “Jellicoe Road” because I was constantly sitting on the edge of my seat every time certain clues were being thrown out regarding Taylor’s past such as why Hannah suddenly left the school and why her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road all those years ago. I also liked the character Taylor Markham herself and even though there were times where her aggressive attitude towards other people annoyed me a bit, I can sort of sympathize with her because of how she finds it hard to trust anyone after her mother abandoned her and Hannah, the closest person she had to a family, suddenly left the school without telling Taylor. I really enjoyed Taylor’s relationship with Jonah Griggs, Raffaela, Ben, and Chaz Santangelo as they are close friends with her and I loved the way that these characters all tried to help Taylor through her trust issues with other people and also, showed her the true meaning of friendship. I really enjoyed the way that Melina Marchetta set this story in Australia since I love reading stories located in other countries and I also loved the way that Melina Marchetta described the Jellicoe Road as being a road where trees sort of hang over the roads, like a canopy and that just gives me a wonderful image about the road every time I read this book!   I really liked the scenes where Taylor was reading Hannah’s manuscripts (the italicized sections of the book) as they tell the stories about the characters Tate, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, and Webb and even though the stories were truly heartbreaking and touching, the significance of the manuscript scenes is definitely something that shocked me after I finished reading this book! For a novel that is aimed at young adults, there is some pretty strong language in this novel including dropping the “f” bomb and the “s” word. If anyone does not like reading strong language in a novel, then it might be best to skim over these scenes. This novel also deals with the subject of child abandonment and anyone who has ever gone through this situation, might find it hard to read through this book.Overall, “Jellicoe Road” is a truly emotional and engaging novel that anyone who is a fan of Melina Marchetta’s works or love reading young adult novels about real teenagers dealing with real life will love for many years to come!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog",26,default,"['sexy-bad-boy-hero', 'ronyell-s-epinions-reviews', 'my-blog-reviews', 'young-adult-teen-books', 'contemporary-romance', 'printz-award', 'australian-books', '1st-person-pov', 'melina-marchetta', 'australian-hero-or-heroine']"

Marchetta wraps you up from the very beginning. And not giving answers for half a book is a risky move but somehow it worked perfectly. Mixed with interesting characters and smart dialog, Jellicoe reads not only as an interesting and bittersweet story but an emotional ride all way through. It is not a mystery masterpiece and I did see some of the plot twists coming, but by then I was really into Taylor’s life so it didn’t bother me much. This could’ve turned easily into those very common drama-all-over-your-face books, thanks Jesus that wasn’t the case. 

Sucedió en el camino de Jellicoe...

Diría que es un libro bastante tricky. Y solo para lectores pacientes. Por mucho rato, casi la mitad del libro, no vas a saber ni que onda con nada. No sabes que tan en serio es la parte de guerras en las “guerras territoriales” que se hacen en Jellicoe. Y entre eso, las alucinaciones/sueños que tiene la protagonista Taylor y los pasajes de los 5 niños que se conocieron ahí antes de que ella llegara, puede revolver un poco. El libro seria una gran relectura, de hecho.Pero por eso mismo, me pique con la historia. El no saber es algo que me puede mucho. Así que no solté el libro, casi. Bueno, el kindle whatever. La forma de escribir es lo más interesante, se lee de forma bastante íntima. Muy absorbente, emotiva y divertida cuando era necesario. La autora recurre mucho al mostrar y no decir. En muy pocas ocasiones te toparas con cosas como “TAL persona es en realidad TAL persona” o “Tal persona, en realidad si hizo esta TAL cosa”  En lo personal me gusta pero no creo que para un YA sea lo adecuado, o sea no me imagino a alguien de 13-14 años leyendo esto y captando todo lo que haya que captar. Aunque siempre hay excepciones. Lo que me hace no darle las 5 es lo de siempre yo creo. Esto de Ficción realista o Libros contemporáneos, o como quieras llamarle, no es lo mío. Nunca puedo hacer clic enteramente. Aunque hay misterio, no es lo fuerte del libro la verdad, esta bastante estándar pero la autora hace un gran trabajo de camuflaje con todo lo demás y se te van algunas cosas que al final podrías considerar algo obvias. Solo dos cositas si las vi venir, todo lo del Ermitaño y el Brigadier. Y aunque todos los personajes están muy bien trabajados no conecto totalmente con ellos. Chaz y Raffy fueron mis favoritos, comoquiera. <3Muy recomendado si quieres algo que se sienta ligero pero tenga mucha mas sustancia de lo que aparenta. Y si estas de ánimos para una lectura con desarrollo lento. Yo se que la mayoría tira el libro por la ventana si no hay algún giro intenso en las primeras 50 paginas, pero simplemente ese no es mi caso. Espero no enfadar a nadie con esto (y si lo hice, ni modo) pero los nuevos libros están mal acostumbrando mucho a los lectores. Tiene que haber acción TODO el maldito libro, o un montón de chistes estupidos para no aburrirlos y me pone de malas. Razón por la cual ya no considero la frase “tiene mucha acción” como algo positivo, solo como algo extra. Y razón por la cual la frase “tiene un inicio lento” ya no me asusta.Y Marchetta hace eso. Se toma su tiempo. Para todo. Y vale la pena la espera. PD: Que dices? Que Marchetta tiene una trilogía de Fantasía? Considérenme on board, bitches! No cometeré la misma equivocación y lo leeré en ingles",26,default,[]

""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"" was used super-effectively in the trailer for ""Where the Wild Things Are"", but it's a song cut from the same cloth of this book, if there ever is a movie it, I'd think this song would have to be dusted off for another trailer. Or maybe they could get away with using ""Wake Up"" in this imaginary movie of the future. My goodreads friends have probably written better reviews of this book than I will write here. I'd recommend reading their reviews. Part of me wanted to give this four stars, just because it's probably kind of a girly book, and because there are a couple of loose ends in the novel that seem kind of forced to tie themselves up nicely. A lot of people I know also love this book, and the contrarian part of me wanted to say, it was good but it wasn't that good. But it is that good, and it's strengths are so strong that they allowed me to overlook the couple of contrived ways of wrapping up the story. And it's not really a girly book at all, but by the packaging of the book I can't see it getting read by that many teenage boys. Actually do teenagers like this book? My couple of goodreads friends who read this whom are close to being teenagers were the people who rated this lowest. It's a fairly complex book for teenagers, like the narrator's personality it's not the friendliest book when you first encounter. It's the kind of book that can infuriate you at the start if you try to hard to make sense of everything that is going on. I didn't worry about this though. Too many friends loved this book, and they weren't all the type that could gush over a Ben Marcus like novel that has no easy way to circumnavigate the text. I trusted that the author would do her job and that when things needed to make sense they would, and they did although it took me about a hundred and fifty pages before I had grasp on who the all the characters backstory were. But, it's nice when books take their time to unfold, I just don't know how much patience kids (teens) would have with it. I like to think I'm wrong though, and teens are better readers than their adult counterparts who whine like babies if a book demands anything more than turning a few pages. I'm floundering more than usual with this review. It's a beautiful and sad book and I'd recommend it, even if I can't write a review that does it any justice.

On the Jellicoe Road is, without a doubt, Melina Marchetta's most profound, heart-wrenching, and ultimately best book. It goes without saying that this woman is a Goddess of Literature. She has an unrivaled command over words, an ability to make even the most stoic hearts melt, and her stories make you see the world in an entirely new light. I cannot give this book or its author enough praise and I cannot write a review that can possibly do justice to this book, but I can try. Most people have that one moment that changes their life forever - Taylor Markham had two. The first was when her mother abandoned her at the age of 11 in a 7-Eleven near Jellicoe Road, the location of a boarding school for children who are neglected or have violent/criminal tendencies. The second was when Hannah, Taylor's mentor, friend, and care-taker, mysteriously abandons her without a word, leaving the school and leaving behind 17-year-old Taylor, who is now in charge of a game of territory wars with the Townies, locals from neighboring towns, and the Cadets, who happen to spend several weeks in the wilderness. Taylor, who isn't even sure that she can handle her new-found role of responsibility, is now forced to become a leader, take on Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets, who happens to know her far better than she'd like simply because they shared a past, and do her best not to worry about Hannah's disappearance which may or may not have something to do with her mother, all while suffering from a recurring dream of a young boy who is desperately trying to tell her something. On the Jellicoe Road is Taylor's story - the tale of her past, her present, the answers to all the unanswered questions in her life, and ultimately, it is a remarkable journey of heart-break, sorrow, and hope. When I first began On the Jellicoe Road I thought I had finally stumbled upon a Marchetta story I wouldn't like. The beginning was good, interesting, and even mildly gripping, but it by no means led me to understand the hype surrounding this novel. I was confused beyond measure by various elements of the plot and I very nearly gave up on it - but then, it started to creep up on me. I had set it down for a few hours to finish some work, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to know what happened. I had to know who the ""Fucked-Up Five"" were. I had to know how their story related to Taylor's. On the Jellicoe Road is not simply the story of Taylor, it is also the story of her entire family, before she even came to be. It is a profound and moving tale that explores topics of far more depth and sorrow than Marchetta has ever explored in the past. It is a story about death, murder, guilt, and depression, but it is also a story of hope, forgiveness, love, and honor. It is a story about finding the people who truly care about you in life and learning to never take what you have - or who you have - for granted. On the Jellicoe Road is told primarily from Taylor’s POV, but it also contains glimpses into the past – into a friendship that came before Taylor and a love so strong it existed after her. Speaking of love, there is so much of it in this book. Each and every friendship, relationship, and romance was beautiful and touching. I don’t think I’ve ever come to care for characters as much as I cared for the cast of On the Jellicoe Road. Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Jude, Hannah, Santangelo, Jessa, Webb…the list goes on and on. There wasn’t a single character I didn’t feel deeply for, a single character for which I didn’t wish utter happiness and didn’t feel their complete despair. There are such few stories in this world that have purposeful characters who are each understood by the reader just as well as the narrator, but On the Jellicoe Road is one of those few books. Although Marchetta is primarily a contemporary YA writer, I am somehow constantly surprised by the depth of her love stories. Her romances are slow to build, taking their time, introducing each character until you are practically dying of anticipation for them to get together and when they finally do, it is so sweet, so perfect, and so human that you cannot help but sob from joy. That is quality and vibrancy of emotion that Marchetta sparks. Jonah Griggs is definitely by favorite Marchetta boy of them all – I love him more than Will Trombal, more than Tom Mackee, more than Jimmy Hailler, more than Finnikin and Froi, more than any other character I have ever come across. In some ways, his sorrow felt deeper, sadder, and more tangible to me than Taylor’s did and I loved him all the more for it. I loved him for his understanding of Taylor when no one else did. I loved him for being able to read her mind so perfectly. I loved him for his jealousy, his possessiveness, his confidence, his vulnerability, his need to be loved just as much as everyone else. If you take only one thing away from this book, it will most likely be that you need a Jonah Griggs in your life, because I definitely need one in mine. I know my review is vague, but I don't want to say anything more about this story. I didn't know much about it before I began and I would have been terribly upset if I understood the full complexity of this plot before I read it. This is a story that is meant to be read and felt by putting together the pieces yourself and making sense of what it means - not only in the book, but to yourself as well. I feel as if each and every one of Marchetta's novels has a profound impact on her readers, but all in a different and unique way. I myself can't say what it was that affected me so deeply, but Marchetta is able to capture human emotions, human nature, and human feeling so perfectly, that you cannot help but feel the sadness of each character. Sorrow is a feeling that is impossible to describe, yet Marchetta manages to create a story that describes this sorrow and makes it tangible, but not to the point where it crushes it, but to the point where it brings you hope and the strength to overcome your own hurdles and fears in life. Whatever it may be, On the Jellicoe Road is truly inspirational. If Taylor can go through everything she's been through, if her friends and family can suffer through their sorrow and pull through in the end, then so can I, so can you, the reader, so can anyone in the world. This feeling of hope that Marchetta inspires is so palpable that you can feel it blooming inside you long after you have closed the cover of the novel. I can't articulate how perfect this book was, but it was beautiful. Love cannot even come close to summarizing what I feel about this book. It is one that I will treasure and keep close to my heart - always.",26,default,"['books-that-linger', 'beautiful-prose', 'aussie', 'swoooon', 'teary-eyed-reads', 'favorites', 'life-changing']"

It's... interesting, if you find it interesting to read about teenagers! Having drama! About fucked-up parents! And secrets! About their past! And there's this one boy! In a tree!Yeah, the boy in a tree is a dream about the main character's father and it's all very symbolic and whatever.So, basically it's a contemporary YA novel about a girl named Taylor who was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven and has grown up at a boarding school. She's now a senior (or a ""Year Twelve"" or whatever they call them in Australia) and has just been put in charge of her house by a shadowy cabal of fellow students, which starts the book off with a lot of adolescent politics and power games leading to the annual ""war"" between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets in which Taylor is supposed to be leader and supreme commander of her Jellicoe kiddies. Mostly she spends the time whining, having asthma attacks, emoting about her tormented past and a mother who evidently suffered from all sorts of drug and mental health issues, and trying to uncover what happened to her father and some other people her parents knew. There's one teacher at the Jellicoe school named Hannah whom Taylor kind of sort of looks up to as a role model, and Hannah suddenly disappears, which ramps up Taylor's abandonment issues to eleventy, and since she's already a teenager and therefore living in a universe from which the gravity of her own self-importance allows no light to escape, she pretty much treats all her friends and the younger children at her school like shit, even though for some inexplicable reason they all look up to her.I didn't like Taylor much. Yeah, she's had some rough breaks. But at the point where she's screaming at eleven-year-olds who have had their own rough breaks, not that this would ever occur to her, I lose most of my sympathy for her.The whole ""territory war"" premise, in which the students, the Townies, and the Cadets wage a mock war complete with rules and treaties and things, all passing under the radar of all the responsible adults, was just a pretext to keep throwing Taylor together with Jonah, the leader of the Cadets, the brooding, dangerous, but secretively sensitive boy with his own tormented past who just needs the healing power of poontang as much as Taylor needs the healing power of peen. At the point where he and Taylor have the inevitable sex, the writing is just short of turgid with lots of ""inside"" and ""oneness"" metaphors and as graphic as a ""literary"" Young Adult novel will allow, so it's mostly about Feelings! And breath! And also kind of painful (for Taylor). Like giving teen readers a little taste of the forbidden apple and trying to make it sound kind of cool and exciting but also a little bit scary and vague, which I suppose is exactly how most teenagers view sex before they've tried it.I can see why teenagers, particular younger ones, would go breathless for this book, but I'm too jaded and also, I have to say, this is a very girly book. By which I mean, Taylor's breathless first-person POV running at a constant high pitch of intense emotionalism is obviously meant to resonate with Taylor's peer group, and all of her actions and concerns and preoccupations, she goes about dealing with in a very teen girl way, which is fine but so outside my mindset that I couldn't relate. This is not a book for me.The writing was pretty good for a YA novel, and the story eventually becomes one of adults hiding secrets (surprise!) which are finally dragged into the light and Taylor and Griggs getting some closure on their hurtful pasts, and everyone essentially having a group hug at the end, though not without a bittersweet denouement. It is possible that, boy or not, I would have really liked this book when I was a teen myself. I'd still probably recommend this book for, you know, people who like this kind of book.",25,default,"['contemporary', 'female-protagonist', 'high-school', 'audiobook', 'female-author', 'young-adult', 'teenagers', 'australia']"

If I ever needed a confirmation of what an AMAZING writer Melina Marchetta is, I just got it.I love the detailing and plot building;
 nothing was left to speculation.
 I think, for me, that was one of the most adhering and important things about this book. The ending was resolute, unshakable and haunting and It left me with answers and a crater sized indentation in my heart. There was that awkward stage when I found it hard to connect dots, and understand the significance of the story and most of what was being poured in, but, after the passing of that stage, I was falling into the pages of this book.The story is set in Australia with The Jellicoe (road) as it's focus point. The Jellicoe was so beautifully captured, it seemed almost as if it was a totally different world of it's own--rather than in Australia. I mean, I would escape to the Jellicoe if I could. There was just... this feeling of calmness and serenity that came with reading about it.There was so much love embedded in the story,there was friendship, and ties that bind, and sadness, and god-awful heartbreak. This book was one with a really fascinating quality about it;
 one road 
that was the center of worlds,
one road
 that held and told people's stories, keeping so many memories and secrets that linked so many lives together.I fell so in love with the characters--every single one of them, I shipped every couple in this book like mad ; Taylor and Jonah, Raffaela and Santangelo, Hannah and Jude, Teresa and her cadet (whose name we know not), even Webb and Tate. I am inspired, seriously. How Phenomenal can one book be?This book is asking:  DON'T YOU KNOW?  Love and Hope can spring from the most unlikely places.

Why did I read this just now? I bought my copy a long time ago upon recommendation of people I thought my friends. If said people are real friends, they wouldn’t just recommend it, they should have tied me in a chair and forced me to read this. I reckon they don’t have to tie me in that chair too long because it only took a couple of pages before I fell in love with this amazing book. I frequently tell people that if only I could I would marry Paper Towns, but that has changed now. Paper Towns would be better off with Jellicoe Road and they will make wonderful, wonderful babies together. I should stop being a smartypants now and get on with it already. I want to bottle this moment, this feeling I have after reading Jellicoe Road and what better way to do that than writing about it?For the first time since I started blogging, I won’t try to write my own summary of the book I’m reviewing. I simply cannot do it. The summary at the back tells us that it is a story about a girl named Taylor Markham, five teenagers in the past, and a road where it all happened. But there’s more to this book than that. Although we spend more than half of the time inside Taylor’s head, Jellicoe Road is a lot bigger than Taylor’s search for some sense of home and security. As the synopsis suggest, it is also about those five teenagers — Narnie, Web, Tate, Fitz and Jude — bonded by a freak accident that happened 22 years in the past. It’s a story of how their friendship help one another withstand the despair that is eating them. It’s also about Jonah Griggs, a boy who is scarred for life and the story of how he was saved from self-destruction. It is also about Rafaella and Santagello’s friendship and missed opportunities; and of Jessa’s wild innocence; and of Ben’s music and loyalty. Jellicoe Road is a book that is filled to the brim with genuinely sympathetic and nuanced characters. All of them are dear to me. I desired nothing but to step into the book and give each a hug — a hug that is not much of me comforting them but them reassuring me that they are going to be okay. I wanted to belong. Long to be. It’s a beautiful tale about loss, grief, and pain and at the same time of love, friendship and hope. I am in awe at how Ms. Melina Marchetta managed to do all this under 330 pages.I know a lot of people say that the first half of the book was like a puzzle and way too confusing for its own good. Don’t get intimidated by that. There were tell-tale hints about how the two narratives come together, and I figured out in ways more than one the connection early on the story. I don’t mean to gloat. What I mean is that it is not rocket science and it is still well within the capabilities of an ordinary human mind. I figured it out and I don’t know how to tell you how that’s necessarily a bad thing. I knew it and I felt that Taylor also knew it and only seeks for confirmation — waiting for someone to tell us that it’s all real. Somehow that knowing makes the journey more painful and more lovely.There were laughters shared and tears shed on the Jellicoe Road. There were mistakes made and forgiveness given. There was acceptance. There were tragedies and love stories. There were dreams shattered and dreams built. There was hope. I am thankful to Melina Marchetta for the opportunity to be part of those. I cannot think of better way to end this other than quoting a passage that perfectly summarizes everything I feel towards the book:",24,default,"['2011-read', 'favorites', 'contemporary-ya']"

One of the busiest months I ever had where I’d become a walking robot because of the workloads I had. I was eager to read this book because most of my bookish friends raved about it, and I’m glad I was able to start reading with this book. I remember asking, “What is waiting for me ahead of this story?”, and they said, “Rollie, my friend, when you go there, you’ll see,” and that was the last phrase I want to hear from them.Yes, I was eager to read this book not just because I required myself to read this, for this is our Book Club’s book of the month, but because this book was scheduled to be read in February this year. Since this book won the poll to be our book for this month—May—I really waited for the right time to come for me to read this book.Confusing? I agree. The first half of the book was supplemented with consistent clueless information that readers couldn’t make out the sense. I believe to what they said that the whole story is as if a jigsaw puzzle. Looking at it at the very first place, you’ll get confused. As the story goes on, the pattern to get the puzzle whole is gradually revealing. I liked how the italic letters affect how I visualized the situations presented. Further, I admire the author at how the manuscript written in a way that it differs a lot to the other narration. The moods of two narrations are way different that they both clung to their respective generations. I liked also how Marchetta becomes picky of words and finicky of sentence constructions in order for her to present well the emotion she intended. To say I cried is an overstatement. I was just saddened at how the past story ended up. I accidentally attached myself to the friendship since I could relate the situation. The difference was just I consider their friendship perfect and filled with love. The group wasn’t just a circle of friends but it became their own home. The group has become their own family. Sad to realize is that they were created through accident, yet they were destroyed through accident. I couldn’t help but hope for Taylor to have a father alive since there was no concrete confirmation of what happened until the epilogue justified. If there’s a scene I loved the most, it’s the last—epilogue. In that scene, I saw a picture of love, happiness, dream and fulfillment. Right in that moment when he saw Fitz innocence occurred, tragic it appealed but pure happiness was underneath.If there’s one person I empathized the most, it’s Hermit. I could see the weight of his burden since the accident. I could feel his guilt that he wasn’t able to control it up. I could understand his hunger for forgiveness from the dead who wouldn’t give it to him already. I feel empathy for him for spending a very happy day with Taylor and end his self with a gun just as he thought his burden was gone.If there’s one thing I didn’t like much about this book, it’s how the Taylor’s story became dull. The revelations of the past outshine the present’s story. I even can’t believe she’s the daughter of two amazing people in Narnie’s manuscript. I believe that the present-time narrative was just an instrument and the past’s was the real underscore. Yet I’m happy that in a way I made the journey with story along Jellicoe Road.",24,default,[]

Jellicoe Road, the prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.
The place is dark and I can't nearly see everything that surrounds me. With a lampshade sitting on my side and a long pillow sleeping in the other, this is the night that will fulfill my dream, my dream to visit the well-known Jellicoe Road. The prettiest among the roads without walking, just a simple stare and a very long read. Silence. I can hear the laughs of the children and the memories, ready to burst in a second, written in the cold stones for years. The history is ready and the skirmish, begin!Jellicoe Road, written by an Asutralian author Melina Marchetta, is my first book from her best and well-known works for years. It was a pity that I never touched her books in the past and somebody should pull me around and feed me her book just to read it, and it was great! I can't believe it, reading Melina Marchetta is an exciting new experience. Something everyone will enjoy or not, somehow the target of the book is straight to your heart.I would like to thank Aaron for sharing this book with everyone and to his great F2F discussion last Saturday (May 20, 2012). The laser tag was fun and I would like to give another round but my breath is chocking me in my neck but in the end, I did not make it. I would like to discuss the book with others but in the simplest way, I write a review for everyone to understand why I gave this book three stars and also thanks to Jzhun for sharing his insights but the night left me hang forever.
[image error]The TFG (The Filipino Group) peeps were running away from zombies inside a dark neon-colored room with laser guns to kill those fuck up creatures. Kidding. The peeps were just having fun tagging each other and the winner is, ugh, the Red team (not my team). Guys, we'll do better next time! Aja!Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven years old and when she was fourteen, she tried to escape the boarding school to search for her mom in Sydney, but the attempt was failed and met the guy of her life. At seventeen, she was pointed as the head of the underground community; she will lead her team to an annual territory game with the Cadets and the Townies. But when she is in need of someone in her life, Hannah (her guardian) was lost and the clues left behind will lead her to the history of the skirmish game and will change her future forever.When I first read the first chapter of the book, which is a very long introduction besides the very short heartwarming prologue, I was so confused that I wanted to put the book down from my hand but my instinct keep me from reading it or maybe I was so frightened not to finish the book on time. The first chapter will first lead you to Taylor assigned as the leader of the underground community in in the boarding school to lead the territory war among the Townies, Cadets and them. Because Marchetta only spilled small amount of facts regarding the territory war or the skirmish and the school terminologies because I'm not used to Australian educational system, the readers will find it a bit confusing, no, very confusing, that in fact few of the TFGs in the past who attempted to read it put it down as early as Marchetta will spill the bucket of facts in the middle of the book. Well, only the courageous one can finish Jellicoe Road and will wash himself from Marchetta's magnum revelations.The manuscript, which is another story of a group of friends in the old town and written by Hannah, Taylor's guardian, was another cool element of the story and a friend of mine, Aaron, site it as the ""dual narrative"" (a good blog post from Guy Gone Geek about The Duality of a Narrative.) Dual narrative is another effective technique to show the story of two different characters, places or period and usually tell the story in two different perspectives. The Manuscript gone mad and it was the mystery in the two point of views that made me connect the dots from the first page to the last. Well, it was predictable and I find it a little bit disappointing; because I want the mystery will not reveal itself until the epilogue of the book or maybe I expected a lot from Marchetta. Maybe some, the dual narrative may find it a work of another genius, for me, it's just another technique that other authors mastered.Lately, I have this close connection between the main characters of the books I read. And I hate the most about Taylor is when she whine because her life sucks! Yeah, there are those when she keeps on whining and repeating her problems from her head and blame others of putting her into that state. From that, she pointed out other characters as that and other these to confuse readers. Unfortunately, in my case, I'm not and I stuck to my own idea of who was that and who were these. This kind of character might be an effective one, but this kind of character annoys me a lot or maybe her hormones should be blame here. The capital S part is quiet disappointing, it's too short to be good like they are just doing it because of heat, maybe. There is no love that night but purely physical. I love her, because she acted like a strong mother to others.But what I love most in the book is the setting of the story. Was it real or not? I'm just a curious lad who really wanted to visit Jellicoe Road. Whether fictional or not, the setting of the book made me jump with over excitement that I though I'm walking into the forest, where branches are lying to each other making a canopy. It's like heaven on Earth, a shangri-la itself! I missed my place, I lived in a small town before and those branches, well, they really exist and the view, well, it's another real issue. Other than that, I also manage to observe that each ending of each chapter had a heartwarming touch of sadness. It's a good motive to continue my reading, I feel solace.Reading Jellicoe Road, well, it was like how the Sydney Morning Herald said:
""Melina Marchetta has a knack for writing stories that swallow you up and refuse to let you go until you've read every last word.""You don't have to pick most of the positive sides of the book, it's just that the book already push you into reading even not liking it as much as your friends does and not knowing the possible reasons why.
[image error]I love those cookies! Who baked those? I think I ate the Hermit's place. It was amazing anyway, even though it smelled swampy with grassy texture (I think I read swamp next to the Hermit's name). By the way, Taylor (DC) or maybe Jessa, what are you doing there? I can't even enumerate those Houses except Darlings.I read the book slowly so that I can answer the discussion's questions and because of my hope to attend the discussion early, I was so disappointed that I'm late, no, I missed the whole discussion. Overall, I like the Jellicoe Road and I will always treasure it even I find other Marchetta's works better. This will always reminds me of you, the wicked in the outside but nice in the inside. It's like exchanging those songs but I use books to describe you and super thanks for sharing such nice song for me. Mabuhay!

How does she present a selfish teen who is special, popular, and loved and not make me dislike her? I think this is what Special Topics in Calamity Physics tried to be but failed for me. I think. I'm not good at the literary but YA provides steps instead of a sheer cliff face so it slowly guides me to something, something I can believe without losing me. Marchetta is terrific at this. The stories of two groups of friends, 22 years apart, are interwoven. The setting is at a boarding school, I think open to all and including gifted but troubled orphans. There's connection between the groups and mysteries. I love the humor and I can see Marchetta has this one gag she keeps using, but I'm easy so it works on me every time.Here's where I go off-track. My parents didn't pack me off to summer camps to build character, learn crafts, experience, get rid of me, or whatever reasons people have. The one time I had to go, I was 19 and forced to accompany a 14 year old Korean 2nd cousin who didn't speak much English. Her parents thought an American summer camp would make her practice language skills and build character and experience. I resented her hugely, packed away with her and bunch of 8 to 13 year olds for about 2 weeks. I was even older than the counselors, who ranged from 15 to 17. I don't recall a single adult although they were in nearby cabins. I hadn't camped much so I didn't pack the right clothes or, uh, lady supplies. I was at the height of my nerdy, sweaty, uncomfortable-with-everything, acne-covered, big-t-shirts-with-animals-wearing, big-'90's-glasses, boys-are-scary, I-just-wanna-read phase. It was a terrible, terrible, terrible camp for both of us.But as I read this book, I remember this one awful and lonely time, when I realized that she and I were in the same boat and stopped hating her (so much). There was one evening, after dinner, we were sitting outside during a free hour, and my poor 2nd cousin was sitting apart, unable to participate in the swift and slangy chatter. I was sitting next to her and I nudged her when the others began clumping up for what was obviously turning into one of those bonding conversations. She yanked herself away and glared at me, and unable to suppress it after about a week of tolerating my situation for her sake, I snapped back at her. Oh man. I regretted it immediately but was confused by the mix of anger and shame, unable to choose which one to go with. We sat in silence for a few minutes. The sun was beginning its slow set through the trees and casting long shadows on the slopes where we were sitting after dinner and the girls in our cabin gathered around the 2 female counselors to ask about boys and ""going down"" (because camp is apparently where you learn all these things) and shrieking as one of the counselors held up a crooked pinky and considered it with narrowed eyes that denoted a real attempt to recall, and I should end this run on. I remember envying those 8-13yos, and the counselors who had started out as young campers only to return year after year. They laughed, played, fought, made up, made friends...they were golden. They belonged. I remember laughing a little at the pinky, hiding my horror that the 14yo counselor had experience in these things and I did not. My poor, reviled 2nd cousin turned to me and offered a broken English apology, with eye contact even. Ouch. It struck me that we belonged together, as those golden campers belonged together.Damn you, and thank you, Marchetta, for making me remember that.",23,default,"['babble-added', 'ah-ree-ell']"

This was my first Melina Marchetta book, and it’s still my favorite. The beginning was a muddle to be honest, but by the book’s end you forgive it that one fault.

An amazingly beautiful story! This story is about Taylor Markham, seventeen-year old boarding-school student of the The Jellicoe School. I’m having such a hard time putting this review into words because nothing will do it justice. I think I’m just left to gush. This is one of my all-time favorite books! Melina Marchetta has a way of writing that is so profound without being wordy or pretentious. She sucks you into the character making you feel you are taking this journey of discovery right along with Taylor. Melina brilliantly reveals the mystery behind all these broken people, gradually, and you are riveted as you read along. Some of this story is shocking and heart-breaking but other parts are hysterically funny and very sweet. The romance between Taylor and Jonah *sigh* is amazing (I think I’m going to say amazing far too many times in this review, sorry!), heart-warming, tender, and sweet!In the beginning of the story, Taylor doesn’t want to let anyone in but you see her growth through the novel, and how she starts to rely on other people as well, to give her love and strength. This is such an emotional story, in a good way. I was crying, laughing, and then crying again, both happy and sad tears! With that said, this was not a depressing book at all but more of a life affirming story. It’s definitely a story I will be reading again and again! Like I said, amazing!Here are some of my favorite quotes/parts: He stops and looks at me. “I’m here because of you. You’re my priority. Your happiness, in some f**ked up way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime.” ”If you weren’t driving, I’d kiss you senseless,” I tell him. He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly. “Not driving any more.”“So are you going to tell your mother about me?” I shrug. “I’ll probably mention that I’m in love with you.” He chuckles. “Only you would say that in such a I-think-I’ll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.”“Strange that you’re hanging out with Santangelo,” I say. “Strange? I don’t think that word comes anywhere near it. I had to sleep at the Santangelo penitentiary for pre-pubescent girls. There are hundreds of them, including that annoying pest that belongs to you. I have one brother and I live with four hundred guys. Girls under the age of fourteen are the most frightening creatures I have ever come across. They all insist on running around the house in their underwear.”“No,"" I say, looking up at Griggs. ""It's actually because my heart belongs to someone else."" And if I could bottle the look on his face, I'd keep it by my bedside for the rest of my life.”“Santangelo is irritated. ""We're not supposed to be collaborating. It's supposed to be a war and you're supposed to stick to the boundaries."" ""We've seen you in your jocks,"" she reminds him. ""Taylor and Griggs have pashed.

To be honest, I spent the majority of this book thinking, ""this is a good book, but it's not that good"" because I knew exactly what was going on. The ""mystery"" was never a mystery for me but I kept reading, waiting patiently for this book to blow me away--because I knew it would, eventually, based on all the four and five-star reviews given by trusted Goodreaders (namely Reviewer X, Tatiana and April). And, yeah, now that I've finished reading Jellicoe Road I can say this book has 'it'. That thing that so few YA books tend to have these days. I don't even know what 'it' is, exactly. But I'll tell you this for free: my cry-holes got leaky during the last fifty pages or so. Yeah, you read that right. I. Cried. And the author didn't have to stoop to throwing some insane manipulative twist at me. She's just that good at writing. Her story came together beautifully for me and I am thoroughly satisfied. This book deserves all sorts of awards.I will say that I spent the first fifty pages or so wondering what the hell was going on because I was dumb enough to assume the prologue was from the main character's POV. Then I looked back and saw that the incident that happened in the prologue happened twenty-two years before chapter one. Our main character is seventeen years old. So, yeah--not the same person. Just keep that in mind when you pick this book up. Also, you might want to write down the names of the characters mentioned in Hannah's manuscript--who's related to who and whatnot. It makes it much easier to keep track of the story within the story.Anyway, I love this book. I'm going to start recommending it to anyone who asks. Soooo...read this book. Now. P.S.

I told her mine was Stolen and she told me this was hers, so I decided to read it. When something means a lot to my friends I try it out. The book is a puzzle from page one. There are two stories and you need to know how they go together and if they even do. that's what kept me reading. While the main beginning of the book was quite uninteresting, once I passed 50 pages and the story started, the beginning made complete sense. As slow as the beginning is, the book wouldn't be the same without it. The writing in the book is beyond beautiful, there is no way to really describe it. The book is so vividly etched into my mind, even though there isn't actually much imagery or anything. She focuses on story and character and it pays off. The characters are perfect. Written to be flawed and mysterious and heartbreaking and they all have so much character development that at the end you feel like you've grown with them. I have so much to say about this book, none of it coherent or useful, so I'm going to end this here by saying that I recommend this book to everyone and anyone.

I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there you'll understand,""

To be honest, I struggled with this story in the beginning - I didn't know what was going on. But as things started to come together, the story that Melina Marchetta crafted is simply beautiful. Jellicoe Road is one of those stories that I will always remember, like an old memory you look back on with a smile. I will think of the boy in the tree and the boy who stole a bike and saved the lives of three people. I will reflect back upon this story and feel something deep within my bones that I cannot explain, but mostly I will be grateful that I took the time to read their story.",21,default,"['young-adult', 'all-time-favorites']"

This book made me feel: All the emotions.Jellicoe Road was my first Marchetta novel - though this is an author highly touted and often recommended, I was strangely hesitant to read any of her books. Example? I bought Marchetta's acclaimed ya fantasy Finnikin of the Rock for Nook over two months ago, when it was on sale for $2.99, and haven't yet peeked at a page. Hype is often a double-edged sword, as many other anticipated YA novels can attest and I didn't want to feel the sting of disappointment here. I have to say that the first 50 pages of Jellicoe certainly intriiigued me, but they didn't quite convince me as I had hoped. I can certainly see why some readers find the beginning off-putting and hard to comprehend initially, but even after the dual narrative of past and present were cleared up, I just didn't get It, the Big Deal about this book and this author. Then, near about 100 pages later and a ""save yourself, Taylor,"" I got it in a big way. This book made me Feel Things. All of the feelings really: happiness, amusement, sorrow, anger, fear, love. I'm stuck with the feeling that no matter how much I edit and revise and rethink, I will never be able to do this beautiful novel justice. As soon as I finished this, I knew I didn't want to think about other characters, other stories. I wanted to stay here, in Jellicoe, with these characters. So I did the only thing that made sense and flipped the book over and immediately began rereading all my favorite parts. It still packs a punch the second time around, even knowing explicitly what will happen.I grabbed this on a whim three days ago, having been close to finishing the excruciatingly emotional Code Name Verity but with 100 pages and hours of work to go, I opted for a longer novel that hopefully wouldn't make me cry at work. How wrong I was; tears were streaming down by my lunch break (aka p. 255) I engulfed this absorbing, heart-breaking tale in just over twelve hours, covering work and family dinner, starting just before I left at 9 am, sneaking in pages whenever - wherever - I could. Melina Marchetta is the real deal: an imitable and simple but striking style, a masterful storyteller with impressive authorial sleight-of-hand, capable of rendering complex, fallible and damaged characters I still wholly and completely loved. This novel is a masterpiece of young-adult fiction (the 'territory war' was obviously the weakest part of the novel, but it brought together the core four [Taylor, Santangelo, Raffaela, Griggs] initially and eventually was revealed to have a larger purpose) and Melina Marchetta deserves all the accolades she's garnered. As the lovely Emily May so aptly put it: ""[She] plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar."" Skillfully, elegantly, and above all subtly, Marchetta takes utmost time and care with crafting both her storylines and her compellingly damaged and so so real characters.And let me tell you: oh boy, did I ever care about Taylor, Jonah, Jude, Hannah, Tate, Jessa, Webb, etc. While it took a while for these many personalities to manifest, I think this might one of my most beloved ensembles. From Jonah to Jude, these characters are real, vibrant, and dear to me. Jonah Griggs: I officially Get It. I officially Want One of My Own. Everyone take note for in Jellicoe Road, with Melina's hand at the wheel, there is an authentic, believable and touching YA romance with a swoon-worthy broody love-interest. I don't go in for broody as much now that I'm not 17 and I certainly don't say ""swoon-worthy"" as a descriptor for men I like, but Jonah Griggs defies that. He is broody and swoon-worthy, but that's not all he is. Like Taylor and Jude (Oh, Jude <3. I think he broke my heart as much as Griggs did.) this damaged young-man is developed and rounded. The scenes between him and Taylor - fighting, teasing, loving - all have electricity, a palpable tension, and their relationship is one of the few credible romances in YA. Jellicoe Road is moving, powerful and dramatic without being emotionally manipulative - when Taylor lashes out at whoever is convenient (not my Griggs!), I feel for her wild pain instead of rolling my eyes at her melodrama. Most of the characters have significant tragedies in their pasts, especially Taylor and Jonah, but this is an author that appreciates retraint and how to show emotion without overdoing it and making it a Production. I finished this novel nothing if not in awe of the talent shown throughout from the author - from plot development to character reveals, this is one of the best.Before, I was scared to read Marchetta because I feared she/the novel wouldn't live up to expectations. Now I just don't know where to start - I've ordered hardback copies of Finnikin, its sequel Froi of the Exiles, and Saving Francesca. I just can't do this novel justice - whatever I say feels inadequate. This book moved me, like The Book Thief did - at my core, in a place few novels and characters truly reach. I said before that Melina Marchetta could have been a victim of the hype machine but now all I want to do is force all my family and friends to read her novels. I've decided that the hype around this author and this book isn't big enough yet - everyone should be reading this author. Jellicoe Road is a gripping read, one that inspired a wide, fully-felt spectrum of emotions and reactions - all of them complimentary. I love this book like I love few others.My reactions by page, because by 250 I couldn't think critically, I could just fangirl absorb the words as fast as my eyes would move and jot down impressions/thoughts: p. 250: Oh my god. I <3 Jonah p. 255: WTF! NO! What! Yass! p. 297: I want a Griggs. p. 304: This is heart-breaking, gut-wrenching and still so lovely. This book... ""Who will be my memory"" I can't.... this book... p. 315: Could he be any more adorable? p. 343: And THAT, ladies and gents, is how you write a credible, romantic teenage relationship. p. 371: oh no oh no oh no I think I know where this is headed oh no p. 394: damn right you better keep Raffy around - the rare female sidekick that is fully developed and awesome p. 399 and on: tears p. 407: Griggs. p. 416: I love the narrative structure, the symmetry.

Even more powerful the second time around.***Merely thinking about Jellicoe Road makes my thoughts scatter and unorganized, so in order to convey my thoughts effectively, I must make a list. Hopefully I’ll give Jellicoe Road at least a fraction of the praise it deserves.7 Reasons to Read Jellicoe Road:1- 
The Writing.
 Enticing, captivating, and dripping with emotion. That’s all I can say. 
“My body becomes a raft and there's this part of me that wants just literally to go with the flow. To close my eyes and let it take me. But I know sooner or later I will have to get out, that I need to feel the earth beneath my feet, between my toes - the splinters, the bindi-eyes, the burning sensation of hot dirt, the sting of cuts, the twigs, the bites, the heat, the discomfort, the everything. I need desperately to feel it all, so when something wonderful happens, the contrast will be so massive that I will bottle the impact and keep it for the rest of my life.”
2- 
The Mystery.
I’m pretty sure everyone was confused for the first third of the book. I am no exception to that. I did get frustrated; I was feeling a bit impatient. I didn’t appreciate the genius behind the slowly unraveling storyline until I had finished the book. In the end, it all came together, and for the element of mystery Marchetta used, I am grateful.
“Whatever is now covered up will be uncovered and every secret will be made known.” 
3- 
The love, the pain, the hope, and everything in between.
 What I find most incredible about Jellicoe Road? Even through all the hardships, all the pain they were forced to endure, a small wisp of emotion was sneaking out of the pages, resonating: hope. 4- 
 You will fall in love with each and every character.
 Days after finishing the book, I still tear up thinking about the masterfully well-written characters. The characterization is so superb, near flawless, to the point where you feel like have known the characters for your whole life. That is the impact her characters have on me. 5- 
 Jellicoe Road will affect your life, whether you’re a teen or not.
 This book has some powerful messages about friendships and relationships. It will not only affect the lives of adolescents, but also the lives of adults. It will open your eyes.
 “It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
 6- 
TAYLOR AND JONAH.
 I don’t recall ever being as enamored as I am with Taylor and Jonah with any other fictional couple. And you know what? They don’t have the healthiest relationship. It is realistically flawed. No matter what they did to each other, no matter what they said, their love was ubiquitous. I don’t care how cheesy that sounds.
“I shrug. ""I'll probably mention that I'm in love with you.""He chuckles. ""Only you would say that in such a I-think-I'll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.”
7- 
Jellicoe Road expertly chronicles the journey that is known as adolescence.
 I’ll get this out of the way: being a teen sucks. I would know, as I am at that stage of my life currently. As a result, this book had a massive impact on me. I could relate to everything Taylor thought and said. Her internal monologues were at times hilarious, and at others, made me choke up in tears from her truthfulness. How Marchetta captures the voice of a teen authentically and effortlessly will never cease to amaze me. Seriously, this book should be required reading for ALL teens. Melina Marchetta, you have officially converted me. Prior to reading Jellicoe Road, I could care less about realistic fiction. I was more of a fantasy type of gal. Now, after being exposed to this masterpiece, my eyes have been opened.Reading through my favorite quotes is making me nostalgic.

First time reading review
Good gracious. I'm in love with this book. Literally. Reading this was like riding a roller coaster. Too many emotions in one sitting. I just find myself rooting for Taylor to find her mother and Hannah and all about the Fucked-Up Five's (just quoting Fitz and Jude's words) story.I'm impressed that the author didn't bore me with the manuscripts. She only write them once, I suppose, in every other chapter and didn't take any more than two pages. But as the story progresses, I find myself drawn to the 'Fucked-Up Five'. Especially to Webb. I personally adore Taylor. She's fierce and sweet at the same time. She's everything I want in a herione. Griggs dear is.. well.. Griggs. Short-tempered. Sweet. Santangelo was my first crush in this story. *giggles* But he's better off with Raffy. And there's Jessa, the young and full of energy girl. With a scarced past. And then the band composed of Ben, Choi and the Mullets brothers is definitely a win.Romance. It's all in the air but it never diverts the story from us. It's basically intertwined with the story.I'm left speechless after reading the last sentence because the author, in some freaking way only I seemed to decode, assured me that from that day onwards, everything will be okay. Not everything eveything. Just ... everything.5 stars. Definitely a must-read.I laughed out loud at this part.I look at him, shaking my head.""No chance. It'd be like cutting off our hands.""""Then learn to live without your hands.""""No, because then we won't be able to do this,"" Ben says, giving him the finger.You're the man, Ben!And, of course, nobody can't not laugh at the Cadets first attempt of invading Jellicoe School's territory. Hahahaha. Taylor's definitely a genius. 0And I'm utterly charmed at this part.""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your hapiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.""I've read and liked Saving Francesca but Jellicoe Road deinitely one-upped it.

Using a sentence from the book that sums up this story, for me: ""I remember love."" Too simple? It's powerful, multi-faceted and complex, actually, just like love... and life... is. I was swept away on the journey with Taylor and the others, and I cried for what they lost and found. In the end, out of the tragedies and hardships of life, I was left with a feeling of love, hope and wonder, that I, along with the characters, discovered... on the Jellicoe Road. LOVED it! Granted, it was a bit confusing in the beginning, with the story shifting between a different cast of characters, at different times. But then, the pieces started falling into place and once I reached the end, I just thought, with tears in my eyes and my heart overflowing: ""What an amazing story!"" I won't go into the plot as this is a story that one just has to discover in all its layers and complexities as it unfolds. Melina Marchetta, an Aussie author and former teacher, is one of my favourite YA authors. Her characters feel so real and the emotions she portrays are so genuine and raw that her books are all special to me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and totally deserving of all the YA literature awards it won, in my humble opinion!
On the Jellicoe Road
 has one of the most powerful (and tragic) openings I have ever read:""My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn’t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead – just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, “Didn’t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?”Did I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they’re some kind of garbage, don’t you know?Wonder dies.""*sniffles*Favourite quotes (Non-Spoiler):""When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey.

On my ""all time favorites"" lies ""On the Jellicoe Road"" by Melina Marchetta, because her style is amazing and the way she drafted this story was unbelievable, simply bleowing me away. Her storytelling is lyrical, genuine and clean, with a very different approach VS the other authors I've encountered so far. Taylor Markham, 17, lives on the Jellicoe Road, in a boarding school. She was abandoned 6 years ago by her mom and found in a restaurant by Hannah, who took her in. They became best friends and she was the only person in front of whom Taylor could be herself, without fears or concerns. When Hannah abruptly disappears, she is extremely worried and goes in search for her. This is basically the main plot, but besides that we also have ""mini"" ones like the territory battles between the kids from Taylor's institution or the love story between her and Jonah, the leader of one of the rival teams, a very lovable character, that will spice up the story. The focus is not very much on the love story, the reader has to be aware of the initiation journey that will make the characters more mature.  I don't know where to begin with the parts I loved. Firstly, the characters are amazing and extremely complex, because they just seem to get better and better as the story progresses. Taylor is something else, because even of her background, she grew up extremely well. As expected, she is complex and difficult to figure out, because after being abandoned, she is guarded and cautious. She is very determined, with a specific sense of humor, very ironic, but smart and witty. Taylor is the leader of the kids from the Jellicoe institution, but she is not in her element, because she doesn't want to stand out, to be noticed. She likes to live quietly, in her own world, but the circumstances will force her to be brave, to go out of her comfort zone and go in search for Hannh, because she needs her friend back. Second, Melina's style is nothing like I've ever read, such a lyrical book, beautifully told and not easy to read. All the elements from the book are tied together and every connection made is sooooo smart, so well blended. There are 2 perspectives, past and present, that until the end of the book will go full circle and the reader will put all the pieces together and see how well they click. Last, but not least, what the reader goes through while reading the book is not easy, but extremely special. The action is very realistic for a fictional read, but so level headed and raw. Melina ""played"" with a lot of themes, like love, love for your close ones, family, colleagues, friends, for yourself! She also focuses on more uglier things like murders, abuse, disappearances, accidents, that open your eyes and shows you the cruel reality. I repeat, even if the story is fictional, the feelings are real and make you so aware of your surroundings and reality you live in. Don't open this book if you believe the action and plot will be sugar coated, but I guarantee you will not regret it, because the message is so strong, you won't forget it so easily.  I gladly recommend ""On the Jellicoe Road"" because this is not your typical YA book. The characters, the plot and everything in between are special and different. Dive in the story open minded and just open your heart to this amazing characters that won my heart irrevocably. 5 stars!",20,default,"['favorites', 'something-new', 'young-adult', 'terribly-sad']"

I should have at least picked up one Australian novel in my first year of book-reading addiction, yet it took me five years to finally do so. Essentially, I ought to have by now given that I'm Australian. Yeah, it's strange that I haven't read many or any.Okay, now the actual review. ""It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.""On the Jellicoe road is about Taylor Lily Markham, who at the age of 11 was abandoned by her mother at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe road. Her only memory of her previous life is standing on her father’s shoulder. Hannah is her only guardian who lives in the unfinished house by the river, and writes stories about five kids who lived there back in the 1980s. Taylor is a part of territory war between the cadets (Sydney boys who come for training every six weeks a year) and the townies (kids from Jellicoe town).The beginning was faintly confusing, but after 100 pages I finally put some of the pieces together. I won’t go into the minor confusion I had experienced in the book, because I believe on the Jellicoe road should be read without much information of the backstory. It will take some time until you start understanding what’s going on, nonetheless you will have an enjoyable time attempting to solve the mystery as you’re reading, right before you start crying at the end. After 200 pages the book does become immensely predictable, however it wasn’t any less entertaining. I’m not certain if I liked Taylor. At times I despised her, and felt her i-don’t-give-a-shit attitude should not simply be excused considering her tough past. At the end I worked out my conflicted feelings with Taylor and saw her in a more of a positive light. The love interest - Jonah Griggs is the leader of the cadets, and is viewed frequently as the ‘dark and tortured’ type. Taylor and Jonah have this heartbreaking and complicated history. There was no insta-love or drooling over each other like crazy in their relationship, thankfully. Anyway, I gladly recommend this book to everyone.

What a gem of a book!It's a very emotional story and at times painful to read because you see these characters that are good people make horrible decisions and become so lost that they don't even know who they are anymore. It's a story about loss, lonliness, death and guilt and all you wish for is that the characters get the happy ending they deserve.Melina Marchetta's writing is superb; she uses metaphors and similes in a way that is never jarring and really creates atmosphere. After reading On the Jellicoe Road I immidiatly want to pick up Marchetta's other books because this novel has instilled a kind of trust in me. I feel like I would love whatever she writes. The way she deals with such serious topics and still manages to make me laugh with her dry humour and sarcasm is fantastic. I loved the characters in this story. Taylor, our protagonist, is a 17-year-old girl who has been abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven. Since then, she hasn't seen her mother or father and feels like she can't trust anyone and that nobody in the world loves her. I feel like characters such as Taylor are very difficult to write because they can be very moody, depressed and even mean at times and yet they still have to be lovable. Melina Marchetta did a great job with this, I really empathized with Taylor and her witty remarks just added another layer to the story. I also loved Rafi and Ben, Taylor's best friends and completely fell in love with Jonah. This book really is full of complex, likeable characters. The reason I took away half a star was because the novel was quite confusing at times. Particularly at the beginning, it took me a while to understand what was going on, who these characters were, what was past and what was present. Getting through these first pages totally paid off though.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes contemporary. I also feel like you would really enjoy it if you liked I'll Give You the Sun. The story concepts are somewhat similar and it deals with comparable topics, even though the writing is very different.",19,default,"['young-adult', 'contemporary', 'listened-on-audio', 'best-reads-of-2015']"

If you’re lucky, you will experience these encounters more than once.I was lucky. I read JELLICOE ROAD. This extraordinary book changed my life, and maybe it will change yours, too.To tell the truth, JELLICOE ROAD kind of ruins you temporarily for all other books. For several days after I finished this book, I wandered around in a daze. I picked up books, halfheartedly read the first few pages, then put them down and wandered away. Nothing seemed to match the magical dream-come-true that was genius author Melina Marchetta’s third novel.It starts out confusingly. What’s going on? Why is there so much tension between all these people? Who are they, anyway? What do they want? Why are they so serious about their situation? But then, invariably, you’ll get sucked in. It’s probably a little like how the average person might fall in love: you can’t pinpoint exactly when someone became special to you, all you can say is that it happened, and you can’t even remember back to a time when they weren’t special to you.The narration and plot progression of the book reads like a dream: choppy and distracted in a whimsical manner. Don’t expect a conventional story arc, or you’ll probably get really frustrated. Best if you just let it happen as it does. JELLICOE ROAD reads like someone laughing through tears. I couldn’t help but smile as Taylor, Jonah, and the others endeared themselves to me even before I could figure out what was going on between them all, even as their painful discoveries about their tragic pasts tugged at my heartstrings.A story this magnificent, this heartbreaking, shouldn’t have this much hope…but it does. That’s the beauty of this book. Melina Marchetta has written a book that is so much more than a simple story in words: it takes on a life of its own.

I was in year 9 of high school and I had just discovered the joy that is reading. I had devoured Melina Marchetta’s Looking for Alibrandi — which I deeply related to, being Italian-Australian — and then Saving Francesca. By the time I had picked up On the Jellicoe Road, Marchetta had only published three books, and I was determined to read all of them because I adored her writing.I’m not exaggerating when I say On the Jellicoe Road changed my life. At the young age of 14, I had not yet read a book that affected me on a deep personal level because I had not yet read a wide-range of novels. That changed when I first laid eyes on On the Jellicoe Road. From the very first page, I knew this would be a special book. On the Jellicoe Road draws you in and fits itself snugly into a corner of your heart. This is a story within a story within a story: it’s about a daughter’s desperate search for her mother, it’s about a sister’s love for her brother, it’s about a boy finding solace after years of torment — it’s about family and friendship, love and heartbreak. It’s about healing, and acknowledging that, even if you don’t believe it right now, you deserve happiness and love, and the world is so lucky to have you. But most of all, it’s about belonging — to a family, a friendship group, a lover — whatever; so long as that person accepts you for who you are.I’m probably making it sound like this book is a dark pit of despair and angst, and while sometimes it can be, it’s also funny and romantic, mysterious and poignant. I cried like a baby during darker scenes and was then laughing a mere page later. I squealed approximately every time Jonah Griggs showed up, and blushed like mad whenever he and Taylor interacted. This book is a whirlwind of divergent emotions — you’ll never know what will hit you and the anticipation is part of its charm.Every character in On the Jecllioe Road is a treasure. I adore them all and you will too, because they’re just so damn relatable. I found pieces of myself in all of them: in Taylor’s stubbornness, in Jonah’s protectiveness, in Raffy’s mother-hen attitudes, in Chaz’s tenacity, and in Jessa’s cheekiness; in Narnie’s steadfastness, in Webb’s joy, in Tate’s love, in Fitz’s liveliness, and in Jude’s vigilance. These incredible, loveable characters are what make the book — they are so real and in your face, it feels like they’re sitting next to you as you read.Taylor, the main character, is probably one of the first characters I’ve ever fallen in love with. At the beginning of the novel, Taylor is deeply depressed and fed up with the world. She has been betrayed multiple times in her life by the people who are supposed to love her unconditionally, and is thoroughly dejected. But she has such a loving heart, even though she tries her hardest to bury her feelings behind a wall of sarcasm and dry wit (she’s actually hilarious), and attempts to keep people who care for her away because she can’t handle being betrayed again.I don’t think I’ve ever spoken about my first crush before, but it was on a book character: specifically, on Jonah Griggs. If you’ve read this book, you’ll know why I love Jonah Griggs so much and if you haven’t read it, you’ll soon find out. He and Taylor have history together, and it’s not the good kind. She feels as though Jonah betrayed her when they were younger, and as a result, there’s so much tension — romantic, hostile tension — between them when they meet again three years later. Jonah is one of the most compelling characters I’ve ever come across; he cares for her so much and I love picking up on his affections throughout the novel, especially the ones Taylor doesn’t notice.If you’re confused for the first 100 pages of the novel, don’t worry, you’re supposed to be. This is not a story that is meant to make sense until you’re close to the end. There are several intriguing mysteries peppered throughout the novel, simmering behind the main plot, that don’t make their presence known until close to the end of the book. It’s a brilliantly clever way of telling a story, and I am so impressed by Marchetta’s ability to keep so much of the mystery a secret from the reader for so long. But once you reach a certain point in the novel, you’ll begin to piece together the clues yourself, even though Taylor, our MC, is unaware of them. That’s when you know you’re reading a bloody good book: when the author can reveal something to the reader without the protagonist knowing. I’ve read this book four times and I’m still picking up on clues at the very beginning of the novel that I wasn’t aware of the first time round.I will remember On the Jellicoe Road for the rest of my life. I love this book with all my heart because it taught me so much, but what sticks with me the most is that, just because I might be damaged, doesn’t mean I’m not worthy of love — any kind of love. You need to read this book to understand. Territory wars, unexpected romance, love, friendship, death, cheesy 80s songs, The Great Escape, and strange dreams all come together to make a flawless novel. I don’t think I’ve ever called a book perfect before, but, oh gosh, On the Jellicoe Road is so damn close.",17,default,"['fave-author', '5-star', 'ultimate-best', 'ya', 'contemporary', 'romance', 're-read']"

This is a truly difficult book to review. Usually I am so excited about reviewing books that I have given 5 stars, and I've been dreading writing this review for some reason. Yes, I did like it a lot. But I just was reading through other 5 star reviews and, I'm not sure I liked it quite as much as most people do. I also see that so many reviewers feel so guilty if they disliked it or had any criticisms of it whatsoever, since it is so widely loved ... and I guess that's sort of how I feel. I really liked it, but I'm not sure if I can say I adored it as so many fellow reviewers seem to. Don't get me wrong. This is a very good book. But it didn't make me cry and I'm not fangirling or drooling over it. I enjoyed it in a rather sane manner, I guess you could say. If you've read other reviews of this book (or, you know, if you've read the book itself), you probably know this already––this book is confusing as heck for at least the first 100 pages. It has two different perspectives––you know, switching between the present and past kind of deal. Well, not that simple, but, I'm not trying to turn everyone's brains into mush here. And then the main character has these dreams/hallucinations about a boy in a tree and it's like ... Okay, is this really happening? Is this a memory? What? Meanwhile, there are a bunch of private school kids having ""territory wars"", and you don't know what the heck that's about either. So on and so forth. For a while, I promise, you will be very puzzled indeed. I figure readers have one of two reactions––to throw the book down in frustration, or to be intrigued and keep reading.Well, it was the latter for me. Although personally, I try never to give up on books at all. But even though this book was frustrating at first, it got a lot better as it went on. And even in the beginning, I was interested even though I was bewildered.What carried this book along for me was Melina Marchetta's writing. She has the type of writing style I wish I had ... and since lately I've been in somewhat of a writing slump, reading this kind of made my blood boil, like, ""WHY CAN'T I WRITE THIS WELL?"" But of course, I couldn't hate the writing because it was so good. Damn it. I also found the structure of the book interesting, how the whole thing is a mystery that gradually unfolds as you watch all the different stories connect. Marchetta sure takes the ""show, don't tell"" rule very seriously. And I'm not sure whether it's a good or a bad thing. I suppose it's both. I mean, showing is one thing ... and thrusting the reader into a story they don't understand is another. At first I felt a bit irritated reading this book because I felt like I was being left in the dark. Marchetta doesn't tell us any backstory. On the other hand, I don't think she exactly had a choice, seeing as the book was more about revealing the story piece by piece. But, oh well. It may be slightly aggravating, but I understand the intentions behind it. Moving on ...The characters ... I don't know. I liked them well enough but I didn't feel like I quite connected with them. I was too distracted trying to figure out what was going on. No, they're not bad characters. I thought they were realistic portrayals of teenagers––how they act, how they talk, how they think, etc. But, I've had stronger connections to characters in other books, which I just did not feel here. So ... just ... ah. I don't know what else to say. This is all very confusing. You may wonder why, then, I'm still giving this book 5 stars. Well, I'm trying to decide whether it's out of guilt. For some reason I would feel bad giving it less, because I understand what Marchetta's intentions were; and I don't think she failed at them, it's just that it took me until the last page to understand them. So I feel like it's more my fault than hers. I also feel like, if I gave this a second read, I would like it a lot more. So I'll have to wait a while and then pick it up again.Sorry, this review is probably utterly nonsensical, and I am just talking to myself now.The point is ... Yes, I recommend this book. Go read it. Think about it for a while, and read it again. And you'll probably like it. ",18,default,"['young-adult', 'yes-yes-yes', 'realistic-fiction']"

4.5 STARS 
There's this little part in the GR book page that enumerates the accolades the book has received and the ones Jellicoe got look too legit to quit (sorry, couldn't help myself). Then you factor in the glowing reviews that ratchets up the expectations from great to impossible to meet. It can't really be THAT good, right?Melina Marchetta will beg to disagree.I'm not going to natter about the first few chapters making no sense because it absolutely didn't. But you won't be left floating in pure confusion, whatever little is revealed in the story will be compelling enough to hold your interest. There's no other way to enjoy this book but to come in blind. Someone asked why Marchetta would tell the story like this. I don't know, maybe because she can? The words were simply elegant and lyrical. You do not mess with talent... this author felt like she slapped me with a bucketload of that.
""I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.""
But unlike most books dealing with angst-ridden issues, this one didn't feel weighed down by it's own plot. It read surprisingly light and funny. I loved all the secondary characters. I loved Jonah Griggs. And Ben (Me? Yes you, Ben). And Raffy. And Heckle and Jeckle. And Fritz. I am foreseeing a re-read in a week or two because finishing this book felt a lot like saying goodbye to friends. 
I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it. ""what are you so sad about?"" Santangelo says to me. ""We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.""
I've only ever cried once or twice over a book, I think, and no, I'm not taking recommendations to shred my heart. I like my hardcore track record as it is, thanks. This one, I thought I've toughed it out well enough. It has been steadily plucking at my heartstrings around the 75% mark (it got me up to throat clearing, no biggie) then this book just yanked at 'em, hard, with (view spoiler)[Taylor finding the tree empty of Fritz and Webb, then waking up begging her mom for just one more day.  (hide spoiler)] and I was a goner.I see this book in everyone's TBR but only 9 have actually read it. QUIT WITH THE PUSSYFOOTING AND THE TOMFOOLERY AND READ THIS.Word of warning:Do NOT read this by yourself, in your car if it's the last 15%.Total emotional annihilation.People will stare at the crazy, crying woman clutching her ipad.",18,default,"['young-adult', 'favorites', 'review', 'foreign-setting', 'heartwarming', 'heartbreaking', '2013-favorites', 'goddamn-onions']"

I can tell this is so hard for him because he won’t look at us. “Sometimes I forget just how bad he was, so all I can remember is that he’s dead because of me. It’s unnatural, what I did. Sometimes I’m thinking about it in the middle of class and I’ll walk out and ring my mum and say, ‘I remember that he took us to the circus, and that we were laughing, so why did I do what I did?’ She always has an answer. ‘And that night he smashed my head against the glass cabinet, Jonah. Do you remember that? And when he burnt your brother with the cigarettes, Jonah?’“Other times I’ll wake her in the middle of the night and say, ‘He told me that no one loved us as much as he did.’ And she’ll say, ‘And then he walked around the house with a gun, threatening to kill us all, because he wanted us to be together forever.’Griggs looks up at us. “What happens when she’s not my memory anymore? What happens when she’s not around to tell me about his belt leaving scars across my two year old brother’s face or when he whacked her so hard that she lost her hearing for a week? Who’ll be my memory?”Santangelo doesn’t miss a beat. “I will. Ring me.”“Same,” Raffy says.To be completely honest, I don’t like reading realistic fiction because it’s always so darned sad and filled with issues that weigh heavily on me. Real life itself is difficult enough to handle. I use fiction as an escape and I don’t want the fiction I read to be chockful of the issues I’m trying to avoid. At least, not unless there are elves and magic involved. It takes a rare book to make me like realistic fiction and Jellicoe Road is one of the few ones that do.There are three other books on that short list of realistic fiction I absolutely adore and all three of them were also written by Marchetta. Telling, huh?Anyway, I’ve been wanting to write about Jellicoe Road for the longest while. I read it and I loved it so much that I didn’t want to analyze it. So I didn’t. Then I read it again and still didn’t feel like writing anything about it. The third time I read it, I loved it even more–it’s not perfect but it gets so darned close to it that I’m just about incoherent. Hah.The story focuses on two groups of friends. One group of friends is in the present time and the other in the past. The relationship the group in the past has to the group in the present is what the story is made of.The story itself focuses on Taylor Markham. Broken, wounded Taylor who lashes out at everything and everyone that will make her soft. Who clings to the one person who doesn’t give her the answers she’s yearning for. Taylor whom adults continue letting down and Taylor who has dreams of a boy in a tree.The boarding school Taylor attends is divided into different houses that are separated by gender. Taylor is the unwilling leader of one of these houses. But she’s not just the leader of the house; she is also the leader of the underground community. Jellicoe School is involved in a territory war with the townies and the cadets who come camping near Jellicoe Road every summer. Places are lost and regained in this war; there is a purple notebook (courtesy of a Chairman Meow) full of relevant (and sometimes irrelevant) rules. No boarding school gets along with a townie and vice versa–and don’t even think about the cadets.Taylor begins the story as prickly as a porcupine–with good reason. She is estranged from her friends Raffy and Ben in the beginning but eventually thaws out and lets them in. She makes friends with the leader of the townies and the son of the town’s mayor and police chief, Chaz Santangelo. Then there’s Jonah Griggs:Jonah Griggs.Not just a name but a state of mind I never want to revisit…Jonah and Taylor have history. And not the romantic kind. I won’t say anymore because you need to experience it for yourself.The book is heavy and deals with dark and important themes like drug, abandonment, parental neglect and at one point, pedophilia. There is a lot of pain and angst and the questions it asks…Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?are ones that will give you pause. But Marchetta’ magic is in the relationships she builds and the ease with which she portrays them. The friendships between the group in the past and the group in the present are flawed and deeply so but are presented with an inherent honesty that gives evidence of their sincerity. You want to believe that friendships like the ones in the book exist and you want to have friends like the ones in the book. The romances in the novel are subplots and while their importance is considerable, at no point do they take over the story. In fact, they are seamlessly woven through the story. This book is a true crossover novel because all the adults present in the novel are just as easy to empathize with and be sympathetic to as the teenagers which just brings home the point: at no point do we ever stop growing.Also, the book is funny. Witness:I lean against the bars that separate us from the others. “So let me get this right,” I say to one of the Townie girls. “All it takes is to insult someone’s mother?”“No,” she explains. “That’s the beauty of it. They don’t actually have to insult. The words Your mother are enough.”“So if I said to you, ‘Your mother is a…?'” I shrug.“Just ‘Your mother.'” But it doesn’t work if girls say it to each other,” she continues. “You have to have a penis for it to affect you in such a way.”What I mean by this so-called review is…read the book.

Seriously, it makes me want to revisit my YA bookshelf and take every book I have down a star because it is just that good. To say that Melina Marchetta has written the quintessential coming of age novel or that she writes of personal growth, family, friends, loyalty and first love simply doesn’t do it justice. I find myself starting and stopping this review so many times, because I’m unable to capture exactly what makes this novel excellent without making it sound corny. You’ll have to see my 5 stars and inept gushing and judge for yourselves what makes Jellicoe Road so brilliant. I recommend this to anyone, not just fans of YA. As others have mentioned the beginning is somewhat confusing. And the focus is rather narrow. In addition, this is another YA novel with a lack of attention to school, homework, and authoritative adults. However, Marchetta’s writing is so beautiful, and the story so powerful that the further you get into the book, the less those things matter.

The first 150 pages of the book are in fact a bit unsettling and confusing. There are different plots going on at the same time, part of it dreams, part reality and part memories from the past but it's difficult to see how they are related till well into the book where finally the story fulfils all of its potential and the plots that apparently made no sense at the beginning converge seamlessly into one beautiful, tragic, poignant story of a girl searching for her roots and her identity no matter what, no matter how brutal the truth may be.

 “And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.” 
Who cried? Me? Nooooo, why would you think that? Red puffy eyes? I have no idea what you're talking about...So where to begin with this story? I won't say much because reading this book is a unique experience on it's own. You have to go in without knowing anything at all.But to sum it up, the story is about Taylor Markham, who was abandoned by her mother as a child and is now in a boarding school. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. But oh people, it's SO much more than that. The story might be confusion to start with, but just stick with it. The topics varies between responsibilities and grief and battles lots of mental health problems.I haven't read a proper YA in such a long while, but this was so much more than just that. Remember to keep your mind open and keep reading if you ever start this one, and please do. Also Jonah Griggs has captured my heart... Not only him though, the whole crew, past and present.

Even though it started off a bit slow for me, it took very little to draw me. I don't think I can even put in words how I felt while reading this book. I tried so very very very hard not to cry or feel but I'm sad to confess that I failed on all accounts. I can say without any doubt that Melina Marchetta has taken the award on being the best at killing you with the words that she writes. After this read ( as with all her books ) I'm left wanted more of her work and can't and wouldn't stop until I've devoured all of her works. This Book was majestically written and is sure to leave you gutted, weeping and feeling left both physically and emotionally drained.

I'd read (and ultimately given up on) something by author Melina Marchetta before - Finnikin of the Rock, which for me personally was not a good reading experience. So I wasn't expecting much with Jellicoe Road; ultimately, I ended up with a new favorite.This book is pure brilliance. The writing is superb; the way Marchetta crafted and executed her story is clever and unique; and the characters are so memorable, lovable, and genuine. Highest compliments from someone who's known to nitpick.*NOW TO CLEAR THE AIR*I do want to make a few points about Jellicoe Road that may make the reading experience more enjoyable: * Jellicoe Road is **not** a dystopian book. The 'war' is a traditional turf-competition between rival teenagers: those who live in the boarding school, 'Townies,' and Sydney Cadets who participate in a 6-week training program out in the bush. * There are two stories told simultaneously throughout the book. Taylor's story, set in the present day, in told in regular font, and the story that Taylor reads about is set almost 2 decades prior and is told in italicized font.* Pay attention to the characters, because this has a fairly large ensemble cast. I made little biographies of them on my bookmark. Seriously.* The book is set in Australia, so a wee bit of knowledge about the Australian education system would be beneficial (at the beginning, I just had a tab from the Wikipedia article up). What I look for in a powerful, ""favorite book"" type is a meaningful connection (I call it the 'Why Should I Care?' factor). Light-hearted entertainment is great, but the best stories (in my opinion) are the ones that are moving and substantial, stories that are simply unforgettable. If you read Jellicoe Road, I am willing to bet it will be a story you never forget. To be honest, I try to stay away from ""hot mess"" books; in other words, the types of stories in which characters simply have a screw loose. These are the stories (and yes, they seem to be on the rise in YA) in which characters do stupid things for apparently no reason and remain oblivious to the consequences of their actions. Yeah, we all have ""hot mess"" moments in our lives, so we can all relate, surely, but I want to see growth and character depth. I also don't like ""bummer books"" - meaning books that are just so heavy on sensitive subjects or ""issues"" that they descend into melodrama. With Jellicoe Road, what's interesting is that despite the heavy subject matter (and the book does deal with some pretty mature topics), Jellicoe never descends into melodrama. Marchetta's book is captivating, but it's not exhausting and it's not emotionally manipulative, either. There's just enough humor and hope mixed in to counterbalance the drama and tragedy. All of the characters have some hurt, habit, or hangup that they deal with over the course of the story, and this is definitely no exception for the two main characters, narrator Taylor Markham and (my favorite) Jonah Griggs. Taylor's young life is a complicated and sometimes depressing story, but Marchetta never casts her as a victim; over the course of the novel, Taylor manages to come to terms with her circumstances and tries to cope with them. In a genre that often portrays teenage girls as walking stereotypes, I greatly appreciated the way Marchetta created Taylor: strong, but also vulnerable; sweet on the inside, yet unsure how to express affection; scared of the future and life's uncertainties, but brave enough to take responsibility and leadership for her world. Perfect. And without saying too much, I think that Jonah Griggs is the **perfect** love interest that I just knew existed somewhere, but hadn't quite found yet. I don't mean he's 'perfect' like he's without flaws or has no personality, I mean his character compliments Taylor in just the right way. This was indeed a very strong pairing. I am a LEGIT fan.I know that this review is already really long, and if you've read everything so far, have a cookie on me!Two more things I want to address quickly:- Portrayal of Friendship: I'd argue that the theme of friendship is a major one in Jellicoe Road, and the relationships Taylor forges with her peers is both real and inspiring. It was so moving to watch a troubled, unsure young girl transform into a caring, empathetic leader. Beautiful! And Taylor's friends are so lovable and memorable, they definitely helped make the book what it is. I also loved and appreciated that these were healthy, substantial relationships, which brings me to my final point:- Portrayal of teenagers. I love YA and won't ever read any other genre as faithfully, but to be honest, quite a few books out there make me embarrassed for teenagers today, just based on the stereotypical ways they're portrayed. For a bunch of kids living in a pretty isolated community, with not a lot of useful teachers or adults around, these kids were pretty dadgum responsible. Like, incredibly so. And I'm not talking about one or two - I mean the whole ensemble cast. This may be a point of irrelevance to a lot of readers, but I wanted to point out how grateful and amused I was to read about such entertaining but mature teens. Maybe one of the (many) reasons why I loved this book is because I respected these characters, what they had to go through and how they handled themselves in the process. And my guess is that you will too.Quick say: I've found a new classic and a new favorite. Please (older teens) give Jellicoe Road a try.

Taylor Markham’s disconnect from everyone around her arises from a deep desire not to rely on or be relied on. Too much has happened to Taylor, specifically her abandonment by her mother and the desertion of Cadet Jonah Griggs when she tried to find her mother, to allow her to trust easily. When her friend and mentor Hannah disappears as well, Taylor retreats from her new responsibilities as leader of her school. It’s all perfectly justified in the text, but her complete irresponsibility drove me crazy.Taylor accepts the role not because she wants to be in charge, but because she hates the idea of being under anyone else’s control—and proceeds to screw up repeatedly because every time things get tough, she retreats to Hannah’s empty house. I hate it when people agree to do something and then ignore their responsibilities. It really gets on my nerves. So it was probably most of a hundred pages before I started caring about Taylor.And then I deeply cared about her. Once she starts letting people in, she’s engaging, tough, and loyal. She does have the ability to lead, and demonstrates it repeatedly, from brokering a peace between the three factions of school, Townies, and Cadets to finally tracking down her mother. I was impressed by Taylor’s strength and determination as well as her weaknesses—ultimately, by her humanity.Jellicoe Road has powerful secondary characters, all of whom are tied to Taylor in some way; in a sense, Taylor’s character is revealed by her allowing others to rely on her and be relied on in turn. And it’s not just her House members like Jessa and Raffaela, or anyone else in school, such as Ben or even the detestable Richard; Santangelo and Griggs, who originally seem like typical bullies, turn out to be some of the best friends she could ask for.Griggs fascinated me, and not just because he’s the love interest. He’s got as tragic a history as Taylor and is broken in his own way, and I love that their story begins long before the book does. He’s violent and mean, but it’s clear early on that this is something he puts on for show, a way of protecting himself. He’s conscious, as I think most children in his position are, of how much of him is like his abusive father, and the contrast between his more brutal behaviors and his tenderness toward Taylor makes him compelling.In addition to the wonderful characters, the structure of Jellicoe Road, with its intertwining stories, really won me over. I like having a challenge when I read, and Hannah’s “novel,” told out of sequence, was wonderfully challenging. Despite having trouble remembering which of the five characters was which to start, I found myself looking forward to the narrative intervals to see if I could puzzle out what happened. As a conceit, it’s a little too perfect—coincidentally the order in which Taylor reads the story reveals the truth in exactly the right order to keep her (and the reader) guessing, but the story itself is so compelling I was willing to give it a pass.What also worked for me is how that narrative ended up bringing the three factions together and undoing some of the misunderstandings that had arisen with time. At the beginning, it doesn’t look as if Taylor and her people can ever be friends with the Townies, headed by Chaz Santangelo, and the Cadets, led by Jonah Griggs (with whom Taylor has a history). And somehow they manage to stumble toward an accord that’s managed by the fact that both Griggs and Santangelo are essentially nice guys who have to work really hard at being jerks.This is ultimately a story about restoration: restoring Taylor’s faith in others, restoring her relationship with her mother, restoring the original understanding between the three factions. It also has a lot to say about how most people are essentially good. One of my favorite scenes is a very tense meeting between the three faction leaders and their seconds, where they can’t maintain the tension because the seconds are all musicians and drift away into an argument about amplifiers.As for Taylor and Griggs and their romance, it’s clear early on that he cares for her, but their relationship isn’t so much romantic (though it’s that too) as based on mutual need. The third story in this book, after the primary plot and Hannah’s story, is the truth about what happened when the two of them ran away—an episode that linked them both so it was inevitable they would ultimately come together. And yet that mutual need is as compelling a romance as I could want. The moment that brought them together, for me, wasn’t their first kiss, but the point where Griggs tells Taylor why he was on the train platform that day. Romance comes later—though Taylor has to point out to Griggs that he’s been romantic—and it’s incredibly satisfying. I can easily see the two of them lasting as a couple because of the depth of their connection.I read this twice for the Book Battle, the second time taking notes for my bracket, but by the time I reached Taylor and Griggs’ road trip I had to put the pen down because I was simply sucked into the story. It’s beautiful, and heart-wrenching, and I love how ultimately both narratives are about a need to belong to something bigger than oneself. I fully intend to come back to this book again and again.",14,default,"['own', 'favorites', 'book-battle-2016', 'protag-female', 'romance', 'supernatural', 'ya-contemporary-fiction']"

But any other word doesn't have quite the right strength. So when I say that it was devastating, read that as ""in all the right ways"". Which means I suspect it'll be one of my very favorite books ever, even though I doubt I'll be able to bring myself to reread it and I'll be careful about who I recommend it to.It's a challenging start, too, which doesn't help in the recommendation area. You have a huge cast of characters, a problematic viewpoint character, political factions (with subfactions and associated power dynamics), and a 22-year time span that all hit you right up front. Don't get me wrong, I was drawn in right from the start and Marchetta is good enough that I didn't feel lost so much as overwhelmed. Reading other reviews, it's clear that the reactions to this jumbled start are mixed and highly varied. Personally, Taylor drew me in immediately with her mix of vulnerability and courage so I was strongly engaged and willing to spend the mental energy to track all the moving pieces. And it does take mental energy because a lot of the story happens in the past and is revealed in patches and fragments along the way.The fact this all comes together (and gets such consistently high reviews for such a challenging work) is tribute to Marchetta's storytelling skill. All those pieces coalesce organically and very powerfully over the course of the novel to form a complete story that carries an immense emotional power. It'd be interesting to track a group of people who read the book in tandem and see how their experiences and opinions match up over the course of the novel. I suspect that while they'd be all over the map at the start, they'd quickly converge such that whatever drew them in initially (and kept them going past the challenging beginning) they'd be in shared-experience space relatively quickly. I think that's part of the power of the structure Marchetta has created because she weaves all those disparate elements of the story into a powerful whole that is full of those things that define us in our shared humanity—love, power, tragedy, despair, redemption, forgiveness, friendship, frailty, and family.There are a lot of elements coming together here, and I'm not organized enough to be terribly detailed. So here are some thoughts on some of them, for what they're worth.Griggs and Taylor I Loved the second-chance romance between Taylor and Griggs. I loved seeing the development of that relationship in the present and the reverberations from their meeting three years ago. I particularly liked seeing them draw strength from each other where they needed it most. But my favorite part of their relationship is that I can easily see it persisting a lifetime, even as young as they are. Theirs is a bond based on mutual respect and care and with their eyes open to the potential for change that the future brings (and working together to let that change unite rather than divide them).Time Fragments The ripples of three past tragedies (the third a near-miss with its own ramifications) are interwoven in the narrative in a way that is easy to get wrong. Marchetta does a fantastic job making these work in unison, even on their separate tracks. And even though it looks like you discover the key to each separately, they actually function together to deliver a catharsis at the end in a way that each not only builds on, but multiplies the effect of the others. This story could probably have been told chronologically. But that would have robbed it of so much of its power.Tate Sucks The truth we learn about Taylor's mother draws my sympathy for her personally, but horrifies me in regards to her daughter. (view spoiler)[It's bad enough that she dragged her daughter through her despair and drug addiction. But what kind of mother artificially constrains the love of the generous woman who will care for Taylor for the foreseeable future by extracting a promise not to become a surrogate mom?!? Talk about selfish in the extreme! That ended all sympathy for Tate and pissed me off at Hannah for giving such a promise. And then fulfilling it! Shame on both of them. And what I really hated is that everybody treated that as perfectly reasonable—including Taylor. (hide spoiler)]Magic or Spirituality or Something The supernatural has a very present, though subdued, place in this story. It's nothing too overt, mainly impressions and dreams. But I loved how not only the characters, but the story took these aspects of humanity seriously. I loved that they have real power (if only in the lives of those who experience them and take them seriously). I particularly liked the solid spirituality it gave the story without having to explain everything (even itself).Finally So yeah, I loved the book. I knew by a quarter through that I wouldn't be putting it down until I finished. I have no regrets for the lost sleep. The emotional punch at the end was everything you hope for in the very best stories.",14,default,['young-adult']

Usually doing that means one of the following: I am in a hurry to post a review for the book for a deadline (doesn't usually happen), or I love the book so much that I just have to write a review about it immediately.Such is Jellicoe Road, my second Melina Marchetta book. Ever since I finished and enjoyed Saving Francesca, I've been itching to read another Marchetta book to experience the goodness of her writing and the realness of her characters. But alas, I know I must pace myself because Jellicoe was the only other book I had of hers -- I still had to buy The Piper's Son and Looking for Alibrandi after Holy Week. After finishing two books from my Required Reading for April, I decided to reward myself with her book.And man, was it such a good idea. I gobbled up Jellicoe Road so fast that I surprised myself. Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham, whose mom left her when she was 11, picked up shortly by Hannah. At fourteen, she ran away from her boarding school to look for her mom only to be found and brought back by a stranger. Now, she's almost eighteen, and she is the leader of their school's underground community that is neck deep in a territory war with the kids from Jellicoe town called Townies and a group of kids undergoing military training aptly named Cadets. Then Hannah disappears and it throws Taylor's life out of the loop. If it wasn't enough, the leader of the Cadets turn out to be Jonah Griggs, a guy from Taylor's past that she's trying hard to forget. Taylor's life unravels as she tries to cope with Hannah's disappearance, piecing together clues Hannah left and things her memory is trying to hide from her.One word: wow. I was warned that this book would be an emotional ride, but I wasn't expecting that. It's really hard to describe the book without putting a spoiler, and the last thing you want to be with this book is to be spoiled. I've been warned that the first 100 pages or so of this book would be confusing, and indeed it was. For some people, this might be enough for them to stop reading and never revisit the book again, but trust me when I say this: don't. Keep on reading, and somewhere a few pages later, you'll find that this book had you in its grip and will refuse to let you go up until the last page.Just like in Saving Francesca, Marchetta definitely had her way with the characters and how they interact here. I thought the book would just be about the territory wars, which kind of turns me off, but the author made that as interesting as figuring out Taylor's past. I loved the relationships that the characters formed in this book -- they all had history with each other, and even if I have equally awesome friends, this book made me crave the same history that Taylor wanted: ""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking."" I loved how they all just formed this friendship without too much effort, and how some characters who come off as annoying at first become even a little bit endearing in the end.But that plot -- oh that plot. When I got to my first ""aha!"" moment in the book, I just couldn't stop reading. I wanted to know what happens next and I want it now. At the same time, I also didn't want it to end. I just want to live in Jellicoe Road, if that was possible. I loved how everything tied up together at the end, and how the story kept on surprising me everyday. Even when I thought I had it all figured out, I was still surprised at the end, and I don't think I've ever read a book that did just that. When I was done with the book, I had an extreme desire to reread it all over again, if only to figure out what part I missed now that I knew how everything fits.While I was going through the first part of the book, I wasn't really sure if I would like it as much as my other bookish friends did. When I closed the last page, I was sure that I had just as much love for this book as they do. Like what I tweeted, reading this book was like breaking my heart and then putting it back together again. It was that awesome. Jellicoe Road reminded me of why I love contemporary YA, and it definitely made me a fan of Melina Marchetta. :)Read it, read it. Take your time with the start and be amazed at how Marchetta weaves a story so beautiful that it keeps a hold on you long after you have closed the book. ♥",14,default,"['2011', 'best-2011', 'contemporary', 'ya', 'tfg-100', 'favorites']"

A home to come back to every day of their lives.Where they would all belong or long to be. A place on the Jellicoe Road.
God, I could just sit here and sob all day.  (x)For about 0.2 seconds, I thought I would make it out alive. Oh, how I wish I could have those 0.2 seconds back. Just so I wouldn't have to feel this 
ache
 in my heart. It's really confusing at first. There's all the talk about territorial wars and people disappearing and a side story that I was having a hard to finding the relevance of for about 40% of the book. I would think to myself, ""is this really what I was afraid of? Would I actually leave this book unscathed. Unmoved? And Marchetta then said, ""let there be pain"".
My mother deserted me at the 7-Eleven, hundred of kilometers away from home. Hannah, however, did the unforgivable. She deserted me in our own backyard.
I was right to be afraid of On the Jellicoe Road. I'm afraid of anything that makes me feel too much, so you'll only see me intentionally pick up a book like this once-in-a-never. But this book... gah, this book is just something else entirely. It's painful, it's raw, it's funny, it'll make you want to cry out at the injustice of it all, it'll leave you screaming why why why why. 
“What do you want from me?” he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.
On the Jellicoe Road was faithful to life in the sense that not everyone gets the HEA they always dream of. To be honest, I don't think anybody does. But some less than others. Shit happens, life happens, and sometimes it's hard to pick your life back up. I wept over the lost promise of the future. I wept over the lives affected by tragedy. I wept for the broken friendships and the broken dreams. I wept for what could have been.
“Forgive me, Taylor Markham.” Before I could ask him how he knew my name and what I was to forgive him for he said, “take care of my little girl.”And then he told me to close my eyes.And I think I’ve been frightened to do just that ever since.
All I have to do is think about the ending to end up in tears again. Half of me is screaming to get my shit together and the other half, the half that's winning, is grieving. But it's not all doom-and-gloom and Jonah Griggs is sure to win your heart. Not even steal it, because you'll hand that sucker over to him everyday and twice on Sunday. This is undeniably an incredible story. You don't just get the Printz award for nothing. You get it for excellence. For being impactful. And that's exactly what On the Jellicoe Road was.

4.5 (Rating only dropped from five because gosh darn it I spent the first hundred pages of this novel thinking ""who are you people and why are there so many of you."")Gah. Where to start with a book like this? The first half is odd and so confusing. You understand the gist that there's a territory war going on between the residents of Jellicoe Road and they're split into three factions; the Townies, the Cadets, and the students of the Jellicoe School. Of course, enter our main cast, which is a mix of all three and you can see how this would be fun and entertaining. But this book doesn't stop there; there's also flashbacks to a group a generation before who suffered death through a huge car accident on Jellicoe Road. These flashbacks are vague in the beginning, but slowly gain clarity until the image is too heartbreaking and clear.Both groups are riddled with traumas and sadness. The main character, Taylor, was left at a 7-11 at eleven years old. The generation before suffered the death of most of their families in a huge car accident. Every character in this novel has a purpose, problems, and a personality all their own. It's so hard to not give legions of spoilers right now, but I'll resist the temptation so that those who haven't read this can be encouraged to do so.Marchetta's writing is unique to say the least. It's interesting, but oh so exiguous. By the end of the book, you still have no idea of eye colors, hair colors, and for some characters, you know absolutely nothing of how they look, just their typical facial expressions and maybe some body language.This was both great and frustrating. I appreciate her different way of approaching description since I created the images of the characters in my own mind, and even if they look the opposite of how I'm picturing them, I would still know them just by their walk or the way they crinkle their nose. I don't know; maybe my mild OCD is why the whole no general description drove me bonkers. That's my only complaint, and that's not even a real problem since I don't actually mind as much now that I've finished it. :)The final thing I wanted to praise was a parallel Marchetta hid in here. I loved that she did it, and adored how she presented it. (view spoiler)[(When Taylor saw Sam and thought about how she could have turned out the same way had her mother not ""given"" her to Hannah. I was so depressed I ate a whole bag of Haribo.) (hide spoiler)]All I can say is read this book. Especially if you enjoy books taking place in private schools, small towns, or Australia. Or contemporary YA, modern classics, novels with a darker tone, or books that will keep you guessing.

BRILLIANT.i was not entirely convinced by the book blurb (but i still read it anyway, since my GR friends insisted Jellicoe Road is really good). halfway through it revealed to me that yes, so maybe Jellicoe Road is award-winning. finishing & closing the book made me realized that Melina Marchetta conned me, but oh, how i loved to be conned this way! because Jellicoe Road is one BRILLIANT read. (I’m done reading in 6 hours! Man, i could not, would not put it down.)First half was so confusing – i did not know Marchetta is contructing two stories that will collide in the end. I needed patience to read Jellicoe Road and i was rewarded BIG time!Taylor’s strength came out in the middle of the story, when things started going awry that she needed to stay in control. I wanna hug her, tease her, and constantly remind her that her past (mistakes) does not define her future. She was willful, defiant, and cunning. I feel for her, especially with the dream scenes. They were heartbreaking.Griggs is one tough character. Not because he’s the leader of the Cadets, but because the story that Marchetta wove for him was dark, hopeless but resilient. His background made me appreciate him more at the end of Jellicoe Road. I found his character very strong – i just love him!This is not just a love story; there’s also a touch of mystery, crime & suspense. That’s a BIG plus for me!Jellicoe Road is also about family and friendships, and how you can find love and family in between those friendships. It is definitely a must-read. Why? Because Jellicoe Road will surely stun you into silence.

One of the highest-regarded YA novels I've encountered, with glowing endorsements, a stratospheric cume GR average, and a coveted Printz award, 2006's (On the) Jellicoe Road (my American version evidently dropped the ""On the"" from the title) is a clunky, melodramatic mess that aspires to share shelf space with the classics, but barely treads water in the bargain bin. Among my two GR friends that shared my lukewarm opinion of this, both opined words to the effect of ""it's not the book, it's me"" when explaining why they could not connect with the narrative. I can't be that charitable. Melina Marchetta has the duty as author to bring her Taylor Markham protag to life, give the reader someone to cheer for, loathe, feel  something for, not surround her in a sea of murk and expect the reader to generate feelings for her plight. It's not even clear what her plight is, exactly. We learn she was, at age 11, abandoned by her drug-addled mother at a 7-11 store on the Jellicoe Road, we know she attends a boarding school with ""warring factions"" between classes and residence houses (never explained well, and never really factors in the story, anyway), we know she has a boy that likes her named Jonah Griggs, and she may or may not like him back. There's a few Kenny Rogers jokes (yeah, the '70's-80's country crooner...how au courant). There's more flashbacks than you can shake a stick at, and  none of them makes an iota of sense. (Yeah, they eventually do, but by the time they do, you probably will have given up caring ). Heck, I'm getting confused and bored just writing this. I'll stop here, but I'll just say I just didn't get the appeal of this book. Kudos to those who could plumb its depths and derive meaningful enjoyment from it.

Taylor Markham; leader of the borders at the Jellicoe School. She is 17 years old, has no time for emotions and limited care factor for many things including the territory wars. She now has to ensure the borders don't lose to the cadets or the townies, things become a lot more complicated when she has to come face to face with Jonah Griggs; leader of the cadets and someone Taylor has history with.As Taylor begins her holidays as a senior, in charge of her house on campus, in charge of the borders co-hort during the wars; her world begins to change, Hannah disappears, a recurring dream is haunting her sleep and a manuscript that Hannah has written seems all too real and her own story is unknown to her.When I first started reading this story, it started off weird, I didn't really know what was happening or where Marchetta was going, I kept thinking this better pick up soon or I'm leaving it as a DNF, thankfully I kept going, I was engrossed into the story of Taylor, Griggs, Raffy and a like... It was a wonderful story that I had to finish quickly. I read Looking for Alibrandi back in high school and was always curious to read the author's other novels... On the Jellicoe Road has a bit of everything for everyone in it, suspense, pain, humor, romance and all in between... its a great coming of age novel that is directed at young adults, but I think anyone would appreciate this one...

That book was fantastic, but I have to admit that it had taken me a while to like it, like 100 pages or so. Then it just kept getting better and better.

They are not fictional at all, they're so real, raw, and to a point relatable. I loved them all, I was happy when they were happy, I was sad when they were sad, I was as devastated as they were and I was in sync with all of their emotions. The thing I was looking forward to in this book was the romance because I read A LOT about the amazing romance that is Jellicoe road, and seriously what were these people reading?! The romance is so not the point, it is not the focus and it takes a teeny tiny part of the story!!

By the end of the book, the characters in this first scene, which is set in the past, blend together with the present and we finally discover who was related to whom and how it all works. In real time there is a touching coming of age story about a teenaged girl living in a boarding School and sometimes with a women in an unfinished house. She is alone in the world, parents either dead or long since abandoned her and so she is a little lost, hard core, cynical and yet doing her best to be a leader in her group of girls and attempting to live her life. She is also desperate to make connections and to find out about her past.There are many appealing flashback stories about happy young sometimes beautiful kids living happy lives and loving each other. And there is also a lot of death and disaster and how all of that effects people. What would you be like if you'd've lost your family as a kid? Would you find a suitable substitute mother and or father? You have to pay attention early on to understand how all of the relationships work and how each is important to the present day.

Probably ever. My mind is a tangle of thoughts and emotions. Melina Marchetta, what have you done to me?This book is so achingly sad. This sadness seeped into my heart gradually. One drop after another, and then BAM! And it was overwhelming, and I couldn’t take it anymore, and I couldn’t breathe, and I was crying , crying…Many reviewers mentioned that at first On the Jellicoe Road was very confusing, and that they straggled with the beginning of the book. So I braced myself for this, but it never came. I was under Marchetta’s spell from the first sentence. Opening line that gripped me right away:
""My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. I counted.""
Melina Marchetta’s writing is beautiful and after I turned the last page I had a strong urge to open the book again and start from the beginning. This story has haunting quality; I can’t stop thinking about it.And her characters, these wonderful broken characters. I loved them.

At least at first. The story is about Taylor Markham, a high school student who was abandoned by her mother at the 7-Eleven when she was 7. From my understanding, it won the Printz Award. There are 2 story lines in this book that alternate, past and present. They come together to reveal the mystery behind Taylor's identity and family history. The way Melina wrote the story was very confusing for the first half of the book. She jumps right in without explanation and you get so much thrown at you that it's hard to process it all. I've read and enjoyed books written like this before, but this one took a bit too long to get some answers and by then I had forgotten a few details. Everything does come together at the end though.The plot itself is very emotional and dense with a touch of mystery added. Though I didn't really care for the ""war games"" going on at the school. It was poorly explained and I found it was pointless as it was in the story but nothing was really done with it. Like an after-thought. The characters were well constructed. I enjoyed their simplicity.While I can't say that I was awed by this novel, I did find the story very touching.

On the one hand, if they are done right, the story hooks you, and makes you need to know how the disparate scenes are connected, and how they got to be what you're seeing. Those kinds of stories are fantastic. On the other hand, there are stories like [On the] Jellicoe Road, which just plop you down in the middle of everything - present, past, dreams, etc - with everything melding together and creating this surreal stew, which leaves the reader utterly confused until such a time as the author decides to, I dunno, introduce a character mid-way through the book. This is the type of book that requires a patient reader... and a patient reader I am not. I tried starting this book on my Nook several times, and I just could not get into it. The opening line is fantastic, and the prologue always hooked me with a promise of this book being the kind that would speak to me in emotional terms... but then the book proper would lose me... every single time. It's just too jumbled, and the abrupt shifts of main character (which I didn't even realize until attempt #4 at starting this), perspectives and scenes just threw me off and I'd move to something less confusing... promising myself that another time I'd try again with Jellicoe. Then this book ended up being my real life bookclub book, and I determined to push through and actually finish it, because I'm determined to finish all of the bookclub books. But still I found it hard to actually READ this book. Maybe it was the formatting of my Nook copy, which is very... free-verseish? Not sure if this is how the actual book is or if there's a problem with my copy, but it was extremely distracting. So I said screw it and downloaded the audio from Audible. So now I've finished, and well... I don't know. For much of the book I was quite a bit less than impressed, but after the 60% mark the story actually DID start coming together and I was (finally) intrigued to see where it went. But having to trudge through 2/3 of a book in confusion is a LOT to ask of readers, especially (I think) teen and YA readers, which is the target audience. And, personally, I just don't think it was worth it. I think it could have been more coherent and written in a way that doesn't require the reader to have the patience of Job just to get to the part where the STORY starts. And this was especially true of the audio, because with that damn music leading and ending each chapter, it felt like each chapter was a series of individual snapshots rather than a story. Once the past and present storylines finally joined up I was almost fed up waiting for it.That being said, I did enjoy the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and Fitz. I enjoyed the message, that family is found in the most surprising situations and that we never know what the future will hold, so it's best to live and love in the moment. I also felt like this was a story of absolutes, the kind of absolutes that make moving on near to impossible because of the amount of oneself given into another person's care, and how dangerous that can be for the one who gives of themselves that way... you might never be able to be whole again. Not that that lesson was learned by the younger generation though, because even learning of Tate's struggles after loving someone so completely that she's literally incapable of functioning without him, Taylor jumps right onto that bandwagon and goes for the same kind of ride. Fuckin' insta-love.And that's all I'll say about that. I did actually like Jonah though. He was pretty funny, and as a love interest in a YA story, I can say with complete honesty that he's probably one of the most likeable and relatable I've read about in a long, long time. Just a smidge too-good-to-be-true, but at least he wasn't emotionally abusive or controlling or fucking psychotic like is apparently the IN THING in YA these days. So, overall, I was underwhelmed by this story. I wanted it to be great, and I wanted it to really wow me. But it just didn't. There were some great moments, some poignant scenes, and even a little tear may have been jerked toward the end... but then I kept waiting for it to end... and perfect endings were coming and going, and I'm sitting there thinking ""What is she waiting for? END THE STORY."" I think the book should have ended at the end of Chapter 25. Maybe the epilogue would still be OK, because it doesn't need chapters 26 or 27 to exist. But it just kept going, and that again was an irritation, because it felt a little manipulative. Gotta squeeze out that last little bit of emotion by stretching the Tate & Taylor bit, wrapping up the Hannah & Jude, and the Taylor and Jonah romances, and tying everything with a lovely pink ribbon. There, finally finished. But ugh... I LIKE endings that leave the reader feeling satisfied with a resolution but not locked in with no room for post-read imagination or wonder. So... yeah. I wanted to like this a LOT more than I actually did. But at least I finished it, finally, thanks to Audible and 2x speed.

They may overlook these young adult books, and we know that young adult books will never get a Nobel prize or something, but sometimes they forget that teenagers also deserve books that they can relate to. That's when young adult book becomes important because it--in particular way--helps shape the personality of young souls. A good young adult book can provoke the mind of its young readers--a better one can wreck and havoc their feeling. Marchetta's Jellicoe Road is one of the better ones. Marchetta's flair in capturing the teenage angst becomes her strongest point in this book. Let's be real here. Teenage angst is something real, and adult people sometimes forget that being a teenager can be hard because teenagers still search who they really are, they still search their real self, and it's a hard phase. They're a vagabond, looking for the meaning of life, and if they run into wrong side, they can ruin their life forever. So, see, it's hard being a teenager. And that's what makes Jellicoe Road feel so emotional and raw because Marchetta is being honest to their readers. She gives us an imperfect protagonist and says, ""Here's Taylor Markham. She's having trouble, like most of you, so let's see how she solves her problems together."" Taylor is a sincere character. Her angst, her search for her mother, her frustration, and her insecurity are not artificial. They all are perfectly captured by Marchetta, captivated in an amazing and extremely beautiful way of writing, that feels so soulful and emotional. It's really hard to write in such ways, that you can feel every part of Taylor's soul insinuated on Marchetta's sentences; that sometimes Taylor and her friends were alive, and the story Hannah writes were alive as well. She handles her problem in the most teenage way as possible, and sometimes she makes mistakes. But Marchetta tells her readers it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to cry, it's okay to get angry, because that's how you learn. It's just heartbreaking to follow Taylor's journey in finding the true meaning of family and friendship. Jellicoe Road is such an important book for young readers because they can learn a lot about family and friendship from a book that they can relate. It indeed deserves that Michael L. Printz award, one of the highest awards that a young adult book can get. When Narnie asks her father, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey"", and her father answers, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand"", I think he's wrong.

Jonah Griggs takes my hand under the table and links my fingers with his and I know that I would sacrifice almost anything just to keep this state of mind”Marchetta has gain created a masterpiece! I absolutely loved Saving Francesca, but Jellicoe Road has left me lost for words. Her writing is utterly mind blowing! I was just sucked into a completely different world of cadets, townies and kids at the boarding school competing for territories, it felt so real and I loved it so much, that I just didn’t want this book to end. Taylor is one of the best female characters I have come across in a while; she had this fearlessness about her that I really liked. I absolutely adored Raffy and Santangelo, every time they were together they just brought a huge smile to my face. I loved Jonah, he wasn’t your typical male character; we got to see his macho side and also his vulnerable side, which he tried to keep guarded (this just made me love him even more!). Finally I loved the poignant friendship between Jude, Webb, Fitz, Narnie and Tate. Jellicoe Road has definitely become one of the best books I have ever read; it was intense, heartbreaking and simply unforgettable. Some of my favourite quotes;“Then why are you here?”... He stops and looks at me “I’m here because of you. You’re priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way is tuned into mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime”I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it.“What are you so sad about?” Santangelo says to me. “We’re going to know him for the rest of our lives”But I don’t want to let go, because tonight I’m not looking for anything more than being part of him.

I will not give any type of a summary as there is no way that I will ever do this story justice. I will just say that Marchetta is a genius. I have read a couple of her previous books and loved them as well but this one is my all time favorite of all time. I heard going into it that the beginning was confusing as hale and I totally agree with that, but just because it is confusing doesn’t mean it isn’t gorgeously written. I know fully believe that this woman can write anything and I will love it. Her way with words is like a song they just sing to the reader. The story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude, and Fitz was the hardest story I have ever read and I loved every minute of it. I loved trying to figure out all the confusion that Marchetta weaved into her story and I am proud to say that I figured out everything except for one detail that I should have seen but overlooked as my love for a character shadowed my eyes. Taylor was a great character. I loved her relationship with Jonah. She took no poo from him and he took no poo from her it was a very realistic from the start. There was one part in the book that my heart literally jumped right out of my chest and when you read this you will know the exact page where it happened because that scene is very overwhelming and so real that it hurts.

My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted

It’s hard being fair with this book because it pissed me off like no other book before. and I have such a complicated feelings towards it because I think it had the potential to be a stunning coming of age story and yet it felt sloppy and misleading which made me resent the fact that its execution miserably failed its content; Disappointing.Everyone who read the book will tell you that the first half is an absolute confusion and that’s true ; I agree 100%. But for me it wasn’t only confusing, it was also messy, pointless and absolutely ridiculous once you know what the story is really about.The author uses the first half of the book focusing on just one element of the story and because it’s so intense, you are lead to think that it’s the central storyline of the book and yet it actually turns out to mean basically nothing when it comes to the bigger picture; an inside joke between some of the characters , Yes, It has some sentimental value but that’s it.

It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love

And I don’t know how to feel about that, Because the author wasted half of her material on basically nothing when she have so many things to depict and portray like the loss of a loved one, grief, survival guilt and abandonment issues. Yes, the story once it gets going is deeply sad and moving but that doesn’t mean it’s written or executed well; The story after all deals with sensitive issues that I’m not immune to. If someone in the street tries telling a sad story and you feel for it and it affects you, it doesn’t mean he/she is a great storyteller, it just means you’re having a proper human reaction to something that will upset anyone.Also the transition from the first half to the second is so jarring, It doesn’t give you time to well adjust and to connect to the characters and what’s happening to them.

Hold my hand because I might disappear

Speaking of the characters; expect the main one who’s well written and fleshed out; the others are simply there, they’re not complex, they don’t have anything that’s for them and they felt flat to me.

Maybe memories should be left the way they are

The book alternates between 2 timelines that are connected somehow. I was invested way more to the past timeline, I thought it was engaging, deeply touching but rushed and neglected. I think if the book was split equally between the two timelines, I would’ve been completely in love with it. Everything about the past storyline was convincing and believable and it made me feel deeply for the characters while the present timeline felt unconvincing, confusing and not well executed. 

Grief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for. 

I’m really upset because I wanted to love this book and I expected it to be a new favorite of mine and it could’ve been but here we are , Maybe I’m missing some hidden meaning in that first half that would make all of it worth it, maybe I’m not getting it the way I should. But all I know is I didn’t love the book and honestly the difference between how much I wanted to and how much I don’t is making me feel miserable.But take my review with a grain of salt, I was buddy-reading this book with 4 other amazing friends and they all loved it, I think they gave it all 5 stars so I think even though it didn’t appeal to me that much, It could be a favorite for others",12,default,"['buddy_read', '2019', 'literary-fiction']"

There might be slight potential spoilers in my review. Taylor Markham was a teenage girl living in a boarding school. Her mother deserted her when she was very young and a woman named Hannah living in the vicinity of that school had found her all those years ago. Hannah sort of looked after her for a while until Taylor was a permanent resident of Jellicoe school. There she and her friends got in a kind of territory war with other kids from other schools but her mind was mostly occupied with finding ways to search for her mother and discover her past. The book began with a story written by Hannah about a fictional accident where two families died twenty years ago. After the accident, the kids of those families grew up together in that same boarding school. They had the kind of friendship that could only be formed by people who had no one but each other in the world. One day Hannah just disappeared without any explanation and Taylor was devastated because Hannah was the only person she thought was hers. Taylor was often drawn towards that incomplete story by Hannah and around in the middle of the book she began to have a feeling that her past had a link to that story. How exactly were those fictional characters connected to her? Why did her mother leave her when she was young? How did Hannah know exactly where to find her and why did she even care for Taylor so much? This is the type of book where for a long time nothing makes sense and then as you go on all the seemingly unimportant loose threads wrap up neatly.Jellicoe Road is a nearly perfect YA book in my opinion. This book deals with grief. The grief of losing the person that meant the world to you or even losing the person you never knew but loved anyway. This is a perfect tragedy. While reading it I couldn't help but think of Zafar Iqbal and Sheba prokshoni books that I loved as a child. Particularly one by Sheba called ""Class Eight"". Those fights over which group gets to use which part of the town, boarding school shenanigans, unlikely friendships with someone you thought would be an enemy, teen angst, little character moments that will make you feel so sad- all these elements are so beloved to me because I grew up with them. The only complaint is that some of the characters especially the juniors acted too juvenile. I kept seeing the thirteen-year-olds as 7-year-olds in my mind because of how they talked. And Taylor acted too impatient and dumb most of the time. It took awfully long for everything to be resolved that readers would see from miles. Taylor's history I could predict almost immediately after I started to get into the story because twists like this had been done many times. I wonder why it took her so long to connect everything about her past. But in my opinion, nobody should read it for the twists but the life and turmoils of an abandoned and a toughened teenage girl. For the hearts in past broken beyond mending. And for those families that had everything until they didn't. I did a bad job explaining what I felt reading this story...suffice to say it stomped on my heart with the force of an angry buffalo. I'm sobbing my heart out at 3 in the morning and I can't breathe. And crying while reading books is rare for me.

What to say about this book...I've put off writing this review, because I don't really know how to describe it in a coherant fashion. For the first 150 pages or so, I was absolutely lost. I contemplated giving up several times and could not keep up with how disjointed this story was. Melina Marchetta wasted absolutely no time diving right into the guts of the plotline, offering exceedingly little explanation. At times, I felt like I was nodding along with a conversation about quantum physics or (cringe) politics, while posses no prior knowledge of the subject. Thank God my GR friends encouraged me to keep on reading. Marchetta is a beautiful, poetic writer. There are so many quotes within this novel that I want to write down in a notebook and keep with me at all times, or have tattooed somewhere discreet. They're that profound. She nailed the complexity aspect of this novel. I did need some further discussion and explanation following my completion of the book, so I could make sure that I actually understood what happened, but once I was clued into each detail, I was blown away. There are so many different interwoven layers within Jellicoe Road. I highly suggest, at the advice of Alexa, to keep a sheet of paper with you and write the characters names down in order to keep them straight. This might sound silly, but it would've helped me so much more if I'd have done this! Taylor Markham is a fantastic female lead. She is independent and loyal. She has a bit of a temper, but that just makes her colorful. I thought at the beginning that she was kind of frigid towards some of the girls within her House, but she can't help it. Taylor had so much love and affection within herself, but came off emotionally constipated, likely due to her tragic past and difficulty with those close to her. I loved, loved, LOVED the progression of the relationship between Jonah and Taylor. Jonah is so incredibly romantic <3 I will definitely go back and re-read some of his lines whenever I need a good swoon. I loved them because there was an underlying affection, even though both of them were supposed to be die-hard enemies. The two fit so perfectly together, like some heart-shaped puzzle piece (so corny, I know. It's late.) I want more of these two, yet I'm 100% satisfied with their situation and how the story ended. The story of Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Webb, and Jude is a heartbreaking one. Again, I can't say much about these five without giving away a rather significant portion of the story, but this bunch claimed my heart and ran with it. Jellicoe Road and all of its characters were filled with this all-encompassing love for one another, that I could feel my heart swelling even though I had tears streaking down my face. I don't think I've ever read so many characters that possessed such selfless, genuine love for one another. And the best part? It wasn't cheesy at all. It felt real. You know what else felt real? The angst. The heartbreak. The losses. And there's quite a bit of each category in this one. Be prepared. Surround yourself with a few boxes of Kleenex. I will definitely be reading more of Marchetta's work in the future, but am slightly intimidated that all her stories will be as complex as this one. Truly, though, her writing is so wonderful that the brain-busting will be worth it. ",12,default,"['read-in-2010', 'paid-full-price', 'books-i-own']"

Taylor Markham yearns for a history. A fragmented past filled with loss and pain haunts her dreams and days. So much of her past is a mystery she cannot piece together without a little help from her friends. This book is filled with characters that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. Every single one of them made an impression on my heart—the Mullet Brothers, the second in commands, terrifying 14 year old girls ;), Santangelo, Raffy, Hannah, Webb, Tate, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, and Jonah. They made me crave the days when I was surrounded by my friends and family everyday. To be honest, I didn’t really let myself see and feel how much I missed it until Jellicoe Road. With emails, texts, calls, and Skype, I try to delude and sway my heart to believe it is the same. But nothing really replaces that closeness.

Jellicoe Road was one hell of a journey filled with mystery, love, fun, grief and pain.

It is a book that you need to go into knowing little about. For the first 100 or so pages, I was completely baffled. The chapters are confusing and the main plotline seems to hover on the periphery never really coming close enough for you to figure out. The writing is intense and emotional and remained so, even when I couldn't quite grasp what it was i was feeling.I don't even really know what to say, other than I knew Melina was building this story from where it needed to begin, and that she wrote the story this way for a reason. Trust me, she did. In the end, when all the little threads of plot so carefully crafted at the beginning of the book start coming together, you are left with a story so compelling, so heartbreakingly beautiful. One unlike anything you have ever read before. It's hard to describe a book that seemed to elude me for most of the time I was reading it. This is a story about a girl who got left behind, about friendships so unique they span years, and about identity. It's about the Jellicoe Road, which stays a constant to every character in the book tying them all together, like its not just a road, but a character in its own right. Melina has this way with words that just pulls you under leaving you with no choice but to immerse yourself in them. She builds her characters in a way that makes you wish you knew them. To Taylor who is blunt and hurt and afraid and kick ass in a way not a lot of teenage girls are. To Raf who is strong and sassy and has such a wonderful outlook on life. To Santangelo who's grown up in a woman's world and is all the more better for it. To Jonah, who's built like a tank and tastes of honey. To Hannah, who carries the book in a way I could never understand. To the people who lived on the Jellicoe Road, who know the true meaning of friendship, grief, understanding and love.

But here is what happened; I didn’t understand what was going on in the book until I was in the middle of it. I even thought of abandoning the book but the writing was beautiful and kept me going. And when it started making sense, it was worth all the chaos. Things that I loved:As I mentioned earlier Jellicoe Road is definitely tough to get into but Melina Marchetta’s writing will suck into this strange world where kids learn to protect theirs and take over others’ land. I loved that all the characters had multiple layers and a deeper story. I loved that even before I understood the plot I got deeply invested into the lives of these kids that I couldn’t stop reading.I am totally in love with the kids from 80s in the manuscript.The characters in Jellicoe Road deal with death, grief, abandonment, drugs addiction and suicide and I am sure for a Young Adult book this is too heavy. I am still confused whether to tag this one as Young Adult or contemporary or even a mystery. Things that didn’t work for me:I am finally getting used to not searching for responsible adults in YA and you wouldn’t find them in Jellicoe Road. And I am not gonna lie, it did feel like it took ages to understand who they were and what happened to them. Though I kinda guessed it about three-fourth into the story, but I am not going to complain. While I am happy at how things turned out for the three factions, I also am kinda annoyed that the story took huge diversion from that part of the story. There were times when the teenage angst and the whiny female lead got to me, but I am glad I chose to eye-roll and ignore them. Bottomline:If you are ready for a roller coaster ride that may or not end up in happy tears Jellicoe Road is the perfect YA for you.Blog | Facebook | Twitter |  Amazon |",11,default,"['reviewed', 'a-z2018', 'fiction', 'ya', '2018', 'e-books', 'suspense']"

The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.” 5++++ stars because this brilliant novel deserves them!Do you want to get lost in the world of summer, trees, sunrise, sunset, friendship, love, memories, nostalgia which is constructed by lyrical writing, raw emotions and masterfully forged mystery? Then you should definitely read Jellicoe Road without further ado.I lived in this book. I fell for its characters. I fell in love with their friendship and story. I laughed with them. I cried with them and I died a little every time with them. 
 I loved this book and it’s going to be forever etched it my heart. 
Five stars and more are for books like this. I don’t give special place to every book in my shelf right away. I don’t give any book five stars like candy.  Books like Jellicoe Road show me a very different world, emotionally connect me to the characters, make me wonder about life, happiness, grief and in the end, teaches me something beautiful and devastating. This book first starts with a prologue of worlds colliding at Jellicoe Road which slowly grows into a powerful friendship. The story shifts between past, present and dreams. Initially, the plot may be confusing and you may not be sure where it takes you but as you continue, you’ll see the story masterfully unravelling in front of your eyes. The constant shifting of present and the story from the past kept me intrigued and I couldn’t stop turning pages fast enough. The past has a beautiful story about 5 best friends; Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz and the tragedy that befalls them.  “And then their voices stopped and their souls stood still and they ceased being who they had been. Because who they were had always been determined by him.”In the present, we have Taylor Markham, 17, Jellicoe School student and reluctant leader of the territory wars that take place between Jellicoe School, Cadets from a school in Sydney and teens from the town. Taylor was abandoned at the age of 11 by her mother on Jellicoe road and rescued by Hannah, one of the House guardians of Jellicoe School. Past and present are inextricable and to understand her present better, Taylor is curious to know about her past and her search leads her to the tragic story of 5 best friends from the 80’s.“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.”Every character in this book is created with so much emotions and depth to the point that they feel real. They have strengths, they have flaws, they have grief, they have happiness but all in all, they are bound by love. The plot is intricately designed, the writing is lyrical and the story is powerfully told. Even after re-reading this book several times, I've never got exhausted by this story.To put it simply, Jellicoe Road is a uniquely written masterpiece. It’s my all-time favourite book along with The Book Thief. Everyone should read it with lots and lots of tissues and chocolates in handy. “And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.”",11,default,"['admirable-characters', 'contemporary', 'mystery', 'amazing-plot', 'books-i-fell-in-love-with', 'beautiful-writing', 'favourites', 'books-that-should-be-more-popular', 'best', 'books-that-had-an-impact-on-me']"

You have:-this school battle that sounds like it may be dystopian or apocalyptic (it's not) so you're trying unnecessarily to figure out this new world (and those of us who aren't Australian trying to figure out the school grade system).-you are introduced to all the characters right off the bat from all the houses at the boarding school plus cadets and townies and how they all relate together. I was worse than lost those first few chapters.-the story is periodically interrupted with italicized inserts of a whole new cast of characters you're not sure how they relate to the story or each other.-Taylor has vague dreams that don't make sense, plus a history of being abandoned by her mother that you know you're not getting the full story about.-Hannah has her own history she's not sharing and you can't quite figure out her relationship to Taylor or the school.-and a prologue from twenty years before (a beautiful introduction by the way), which I got later was related to the characters in the italicized inserts (duh, it's the same names) which made them so much more interesting once they had a foundation, but when everything was dumped on me at once, it took a good hundred pages before I wasn't confused at what characters were in what scenes and how everything related together and even half the time what was happening.The only things that kept me going were A) my own stubbornness (because this book has gotten such rave reviews and I was bound and determined to find out why) and B) Griggs. While I found Taylor a bit annoying, I was dying to crack Grigg's shell. I honestly don't know if I would have finished the book if it weren't for him, which is a shame because by midway, I was so caught up in Taylor's story, I finished it in a day. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I know if I went back and reread the book, it would be so much more poignant the second time around, but I'd rather have been caught up in the first time instead of being so frustrated.Once I understood all that Taylor is protecting inside, I wanted to protect her and help her along this journey to discover why she was abandoned by her mother years ago. I loved her relationships and some of the dialogue and in the end I cried for her. All the characters are endearing. It's that powerful and beautiful and tragic. And the ending is perfect. The only thing that was a stretch for me was that she didn't figure out the mystery right off the bat, and if she knew, we should have known. But it didn't bother me too much to discover the journey along with her.",12,default,"['young-adult', 'mystery-thriller', 'romance', 'contemporary']"

Here's the thing: her writing is powerful and deeply emotional, and it's difficult not to gush, stare at the pile of tissues next to the reading chair and wonder how she managed to make you cry so often and like it, or otherwise succumb to a state somewhere between awe and stupor. I've learned to have high expectations every time I start one of her novels. I don't give a lot of five-star reviews; out of the last 80 or so books I've read, I've given five stars to seven, and three of them are Melina Marchetta novels. The beginning of this one, as several reviewers have pointed out, is a little bit confusing. There are two stories being told, a present-day narrative and a story about five teenagers in the past. In the present-day narrative, seventeen year-old Taylor Markham, whose mother abandoned her at a 7-11 when she was eleven, is the reluctant leader of the the boarders' faction in a school territory war between the boarders, Cadets, and Townies. “Huh,” I thought. “Maybe this will be the Marchetta novel I don't end up loving.”WRONG. Then I was sucked into the rabbit hole, completely captivated by the characters and their stories. Grief and guilt are major themes here; the stories of these teens are riddled with more tragedy than any young person should have to bear. It's almost too much weight for a narrative to bear, really. But while part of the point is that there's something about grief that is fundamentally lonely, Marchetta's characters typically refuse to let each other carry its burden without help. They get angry with each other, annoyed with each other. They might refuse to communicate with each other for a while, and at other times, they might not communicate very well. However, on a very basic level, one of this author's greatest talents is the representation of friendships held together by love, force of will, and sheer faith in the notion that the friend is worth the effort. It's part of why her secondary characters tend to be so endearing, and it's a major step in the growth arc for her each of her main characters. I don't know what else to say about this remarkable novel other than to speculate that if it doesn't emotionally affect a reader on at least some level, I have no idea what to do with that reader. I'd be tempted to make the sign of the horns for protection, go all Jenny-from-the-Outlander-series-in-a-bad-moment, and declare, “Ye have nae soul!”Okay, kidding on that last part.Sort of.

It took a good ¼ to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I’m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn’t be rereading this book in the near future, about ¾ the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy. Given how much pleasure I got from reading it, perhaps I’m wrong and perhaps just the right amount of content was included. The seemingly mandatory teen romance(s) that are in young adult books with teenage characters; I’d like to read just a few sans that plot point.It’s definitely worth continuing to read as the reader is eventually let in on everything that’s going on and all the mysteries are solved.4 to 4 ½ stars",11,default,"['novel', 'young-adult', 'fiction', 'bookclub', 'goodreads-author', '1-also-at-librarything', 'readbooks-female-author-or-illust', 'z2011', 'zz-4star', 'reviewed']"

As much as I enjoyed the end, it was too little to late for me. If not for all the positives I had heard from Bookers, I probably wouldn't have finished it at all. That being said, it was worth it to stick it out. It tied everything together and I get it. I almost feel like I should read it all over again, that way everything would make sense.

But when you think about the comparatively short time students spend there, it makes sense. No matter how ancient its foundation, no establishment - school, college, regiment, club, whatever - is really any older than its current most senior members, which in the case of most schools means four to six years. After that the only explanation for any local custom or observance would be, “We’ve always done that.” With the Jellicoe School, an Australian boarding school about 600 kilometres from Sydney & another kilometre this side of the Black Stump, the principal preoccupation is a form of mock combat called the Territory Wars, a three-sided struggle between the students of the Jellicoe School, the Townies - the teenagers who live in the nearby town itself - & the Cadets, boys bused out from a military school in Sydney to encamp for their annual field exercises. Some readers, probably mostly attracted by the story’s relationships, find the Territory Wars a distraction. I loved them & thought they gave the school real distinction - without them, On the Jellicoe Road would be like Tom Brown’s School Days without Rugby (duh!) football. The principal character & narrator, Taylor Markham, is the House Leader of one of the school dormitories, which makes her a caregiver & advisor for the junior girls, as well as a major strategist in the Territory Wars. She has a complicated & stormy emotional life, having been given away by her addict mother (@ a 7/ll store) to a woman named Hannah who acts as Taylor’s guardian as well as being a kind of non-resident house supervisor. The rules for the Territory Wars are set down in a purple covered book which is passed on from one senior class to its successors. I’m a bit vague on how they’re conducted tho’ eventually we discover their origin - they seem sort of like a large scale version of Capture the Flag with no flag fought for access to trails & to the river. Hostages are taken to effect the transfer of territory, but they, especially the younger girls, are treated with courtesy & respect. Violence seems to be limited to an occasional punch up amongst the boys & negotiations & peace talks occur with all the gravitas of Bismarck or Kissinger. But there is also a backstory, partly told in the form of a MS (printed here in italics) written by Hannah that Taylor is reading, that involves an earlier generation of characters who come to figure importantly in the present story as well. Besides her school life, Taylor has to deal with two other emotional relationships, her quest for the mother who abandoned her & her growing attachment to Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets. I loved this book & definitely ranked it in the top five school stories that I’ve read by contemporary authors, alongside (in the order I read them) Patrick Gale’s Friendly Fire, Megan Abbott’s Dare Me, Anton DiSclafani's The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls, & Tana French’s The Secret Place. Some of the parallels are striking: like Sophie in Friendly Fire, Taylor is in effect an orphan for whom her school is also her home & family. Like Dare Me & Yonahlossee, Jellicoe Road gives us miniature world in which competition is the principle of moral & spiritual formation - along with caregiving as in The Secret Place. In On the Jellicoe Road we see how a five-star book illumines those we’ve already read. If you like school stories & you’re not living in Australia, get hold of the audio version. Not only does Rebecca Macauley read it beautifully, but you’ll hear Taylor & the other characters speaking in their own vernacular. Indeed, I enjoyed it so much that I’ll be pleased to give my copy of the CD to the first GR friend who asks me for it, if you’ll promise to pass it on to another reader to enjoy afterwards.",10,default,"['the-secret-history', 'five-stars-in-2015']"

Five months after...Have you ever been intimidated to write up a review of a book you just read?Where you scramble to find the right words to best describe the full experience of what you just went through but come up with a page-full of inadequate sentences and ramblings that made little sense? This was how I felt when I read Jellicoe Road. The first few pages of this book confused me. I remember thinking that maybe I was out of my depth and that I should stop and save it for a day when my mind wasn’t so full of cobwebs. But there was just something about Narnie’s silent tenderness that wouldn’t let me stop. So I read; until the words off the pages became clearer and the characters of the book spoke with determined voices. I read until the book became a movie in my mind’s eye and the heartaches became so visceral that reading became a cycle of starts and stops. But no matter how much time I gave myself, the characters’ miserable plights became even more heartbreaking that I found myself tearfully wondering - why the heck was I putting my heart in an emotional blender? I am one of those readers who steer clear of angst and reality fiction for the simple fact that I read to escape. My life is real enough. I’d rather read of rainbows and unicorns and slain dragons. But after reading Jellicoe, I couldn’t help but feel that I was missing a whole lot.Before Jellicoe Road, I read Melina Marchetta’s Saving Francesca and The Piper’s Son first. Don’t get me wrong, both books affected me in their own rights. But Jellicoe Road is something else altogether. Once I figured out the elaborate web of this novel, I learned to appreciate the overwrought and emotional journey that Melina Marchetta took me at the time. I love the way Melina made me fall in love with a character that to some may consider flawed beyond redemption.Take Tate Markham, for example. She fell apart because the love of her life died; so much so that she couldn’t even stay sober for her child. She abused her body by any means necessary to stay numb. I found her selfish and weak, neglectful of the single person who should’ve been her solace and salvation. But throughout the book, did I feel any contempt against her? The answer is, no. I found it difficult to get angry when all I could feel was her palpable loss. Melina Marchetta's writing is that potent. I could go on and on about every character in this book, but I’d probably just end up repeating myself anyway. I read On the Jellicoe Road last May and it’s taken me a while to actually write a proper review. I have been re-reading this on days when not a single book on my shelf looks enticing. I can honestly say that asking me to pick which among of Melina Marchetta’s works is my favorite is like asking me to pick which of my two children do I love more. It’s just wrong. This is an award-winning book that rightfully deserves all the accolades it’s been getting. As for this review, all I can say is, I tried my best.",10,default,"['favourites', 'cant-put-these-down', 'own', 'marchettaisagod', 'aussie', 'aussome']"

It has teenagers in it, but it isn't YA. I can't see teenagers enjoying it like they might enjoy Looking for Alibrandi, which in my opinion is the superior book. But I've realized that the Printz Award is awarded to books that adults wish teens would read, not necessarily those that they would enjoy. I'm not saying that Twilight should have gotten the 2006 Printz. Rather, I wish this book hadn't been marketed as YA, because it isn't.It took me two months to finish it. The first 100 pages are very difficult to read through the first time around. I can't imagine most teens finishing the book, let alone getting past the first chapter. The story doesn't pick up until 1/3rd of the way through. Pacing is a major issue. Honestly, I wouldn't have finished this if I hadn't read Marchetta's debut. And the unabashed praise surrounding Marchetta was also persuaded me to stick through to the end. As a protagonist, Taylor is functional. She's neither brilliant nor depressing. She just exists, and I guess that's part of the problem. She doesn't have a well pronounced voice. Jossie, from Looking for Alibrandi, had a voice. Taylor has a whisper. She isn't memorable, which is why I wasn't running to finish Jellicoe.I didn't like Jonah Griggs. I heard some of you scream in anguish. Sorry, but it's true. Sure, he was throwing himself a constant pity party, and he was supposed to be ridiculously handsome, but I didn't like him. Much like I didn't like Jacob in Looking for Alibrandi, I didn't like Jonah Griggs. Their romance was kind of bleh. Their relationship rubbed me the wrong way.The inter-weaved plot lines didn't work for me. I would have rather Marchetta focused on either Taylor or Hannah. Both didn't work for me. Also, the family plot line and the territory plot line were a random fit. What did one have to do with the other? Favorite character: Either Ben, Chaz, or Sam. Sam's story, and consequently Taylor's backstory, was really grating. I would have rather the novel focused on them. That, I thought, was sad, not Jonah's tragic abuse story. I hate when characters are excused for their actions because of their tragic pasts. 2.5 stars. This wasn't for me. ",10,default,[]

Melina Marchetta has a masterful way with words. Her writing is simple and yet effective. She’s down to earth, whilst being thought provoking. Lamb dressed as mutton. I could go into a plot summary for you, but I think it would ruin the experience; therefore, I’ll say this:There is a story within a story that inevitably intertwines the past to the present, and both are vivid and remarkably told. The dust jacket and/or blubs will present this book as a mystery, but to be frank, that’s a bit false. All mystery dissipates 150 pages in, with the first 50 pages being a bit of a confusing mess. I’ll admit, I had my doubts about Jellicoe Road in the beginning. The narrative hops around way too often, in no seeming order, and there were times when I had no idea who was speaking. But I pressed on, hoping that the story would reveal itself in time if I could only endure for a little longer. I’ll note here that Marchetta has this way of luring you in against your will. In this instance, I was compelled by Taylor Markham, even though there were times that I was a bit put out with her. She’s just so lost, so solitary, so angry and she’s been so betrayed. You want to slap her, then give her a hug. Though, as Marchetta has proven with her other works, her narrator is never the only character to shine albeit they shine through a rain cloud as her characters are almost always emotional train wrecks. Nevertheless, everyone is complex in their own unique, intriguing way. You get the sense that these people exist, somewhere along the Jellicoe Road. Their stories begin to feel like your experiences, their pasts become your memories. You can’t help but fall a little in love with them.All in all, Jellicoe Road won a Printz Award for good reason, and if you can just stick it out for 50 trying pages, you will be more than well compensated.",10,default,['2010']

It is Australian Melina Marchetta's third book and the first of hers I've read. A fault that will have to be remedied quickly as I absolutely loved this knotty, painful, beautiful book. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School--a backwoods boarding school located somewhere in Australia. Abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, Taylor was taken in by a mysterious woman named Hannah and installed at the school. Now eighteen, Taylor is embroiled in turf wars between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets. But when Hannah up and leaves without a word, Taylor is convinced it has something to do with her mother and with a horrific accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road twenty-two years before. Past and present become harder to discern as the story unfolds. Simultaneously obsessed with and terrified of finding out what happened and just how closely it is tied to her own fragmented life, Taylor is forced to form alliances with the leaders of her rival gangs, including Cadet leader Jonah Griggs with whom she shares a confusing and painful history. This story grabbed me by the throat and shook me until I begged for mercy. Parts of it read almost stream of consciousness and you have to just let it wash over you as characters and histories distill and become clearer on the page and in your mind at about the same pace they do for Taylor herself. And by the time the wars really begin, you are so invested it's impossible to extricate yourself from the world Marchetta has created. Fortunately you don't want to. I was charmed by the dust and heat of the Australian summer, the layered language with its overtones of fear and longing, and the periodic chapters detailing the story of five children who were determined to survive after the world ended. This book will both stop your heart and then remind you how to breathe again. It's gorgeous and deserves every accolade it gets.",10,default,"['ya', 'belovedbookshelf', 'girls-who-do-things']"

Stunning.''It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la.''Jellicoe Road is a story about grief, love and family ties. (In an unusual way, I guess.) It follows two different story arcs. One being Taylor's life in a boarding school, and the constant territory wars between the townies, the cadets and the kids who attend the boarding school.The second arc follows a story about 5 kids, which Hannah, who is Taylor's 'guardian', tells her about. What this story is actually about, and how it ties in with Taylor's story, you have to find out for yourselves! At the beginning I was kind of confused by all of this, but that still didn't take from my reading experience. I was glued to the pages, even though I had a hard time figuring out what is going on.That's how amazing Melina Marchetta's writing style is.Breathtaking, beautiful, captivating.Sounds strange, but I feel like this woman totally got me! I've waited for a story like this for so long!The whole scenery and setting were right up my alley. The characters were SO real. I felt like I was there. With them.

We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.

This is Printz prize winner, which many have said is a clear indication of YA greatness.Taylor Markham is among the senior students of a boarding school, and the novel opens as she is given more leadership responsibilities to fight the Townies and Cadets, all of whose borders seem to intersect. All the teens take the rules and territories with utmost seriousness, the way teens do. This premise was a bit confusing to me as a reader at times, because it was hard to visualize some of the landscape (and do Cadets always live in tents?)Taylor's Mom abandoned her when she was 11, and she's lived at the school ever since (so here's the YA orphanish trope) but she's been looked after by a woman living at the school named Hannah. Hannah has her own book about a group of teenaged friends that Taylor starts to read, and it starts playing an even more important part in the story. And then Hannah disappears.And then there are serial killers and mysterious brigadiers and drug addicts and prostitutes.I felt it was a little uneven in the storytelling, to the extent that some of the characters lacked a certain realism. I actually thought the best parts were Taylor's connections with other people; the author is able to capture that heightened, ""this matters more than anything else so far in my life"" feeling, and also the inevitability of some relationships.

Then in between chapters we get the second story told in third person that follows a group of friends after they share a traumatic experience. Over the book, these two stories merged in such a way that it will leave you speechless. And that is where the magic of this book lies.So why not five stars? To be honest, I had a really hard time getting into the book initially. Marchetta throws you in with little no background or explanations and there seemed to be no solid ground to grab onto. I didn't understand the townie vs cadets vs students war that was going on or how it was so violent with no consequences. And I also didn't warm up to Taylor right away. She's a very prickly character who seems to care for no one - not even herself. As the story goes on, we get to know more about her and eventually I understand her actions. It was a bold choice to start the novel this way and ultimately it's why I gave it four stars.My absolute favorite part of this story was the past glimpses.

""It was boring and confusing then confusing and weird and then it was weirdly beautiful. I cried."" I can't give this book five stars, no matter how much I liked the ending or how much a re-read helps because my first read of the first 2/3rds of the book wasn't a good experience. I forced myself to finish it and you should never feel that way about a five star book so here's a review, eyes wide open.Jellicoe Road tells two stories, separated by decades, and neither of them was initially compelling for me. The story the highly quotable opening lines come from the first, older story. The first story set events in motion that the second story relies on. Unfortunately Melina Marchetta tells the first story like an asshole. I'm sorry, I tried to think of a better way to put it, but even my best alternative was just a watered down rephrasing of the asshole sentiment. Marchetta deliberately muddles a complicated series of events. She constantly obscures how the stories connect. It became frustrating, felt unnecessary, and really detracted from my experience. To stop you from connecting the stories too fast the characters that appear in both stories have two names. Yeah, characters. If it had to be done then it should've only been done once. I enjoy thinking while I read, but I don't enjoy crossword puzzles either.I experienced a bit of name soup in each individual story. There were so many character's running back in Taylor's story, the present day story, that I sort of gave up. There are little girls running around all of whom Taylor is responsible for, other house heads, her friends, the townies, and the military camp group. When you tack on a secondary story with characters who have nicknames and unrevealed proper names it just became too much. I don't think it was me because I've been perfectly capable of keeping track of a large cast before. Also, I had similar feelings about the cast of Saving Francesca.Taylor's story involves the territory wars -- a game the students at the Jellicoe school play against the townies and the military school, but the game is taken very seriously for some reason. Since these games only go on while the military school is out there doing training I never felt the game was as life or death as it felt to the characters. They had to tolerate each other for six (or was it eight?) weeks a year. The fact that the wars were so temporary made me really uninterested in negotiations between the various factions. I didn't get why it was such a big deal for the townies to get access to ""the clubhouse"" if the military school would be gone in a few weeks. It felt like a frivolous thing to invest so many pages on and I could tell the author went back and forth a little on how important the 'wars' were. At one point Taylor marvels at being in a place for the first time in years because they'd lost the territory back then and at other points she says they only actually have to be careful while the military school is around... Well, which is it?The end of the book connects a lot of people and events. It made little snippets of conversation or things peppered through the book come together. Re-reading I saw more connective stuff like 'oh there's the purple notebook' and 'oh mention of the postman,' but I wish this stuff had stuck with me enough to enjoy it all at the conclusion. Of course, if I hadn't found so much of it bloody inane I might have begun to guess at the importance of certain things earlier.There are some timeline things that made no sense to me, like Jessa knowing about the tunnels. Her mother died when she was two and her father lived as a hermit in the woods for years afterward. She doesn't know he was the hermit or that he died. It's implied he didn't stick around long after her mother died because he was afraid of tainting her. Hannah found her in foster care and brought her to Jellicoe, yet somehow her father who had been out of her life for a significant period of time let her know there was a secret tunnel in her dorm building? Eh... No. Unlikely. There were several dorm buildings and her father never knew Jessa while she lived at the school so I think it's all just a little too unlikely.As for the characters, Marchetta made my heartbreak for Tate even though I hated her. She made me feel the tragedy in Hannah wanting to live even after her brother died. She made me want Jonah for Taylor and Hannah's happy ending. I cried more than a little over an apology that needed no forgiveness and the author made the unfinished house from the beginning of the novel into a dream for me too. The conclusions of the book, even the serial killer story, made the rest of the novel worthwhile, but it doesn't blind me to the flaws or how difficult it was for me to slog through some of it. I think it's a good book, but unfortunately I didn't have a religious experience over it.",9,default,"['coming-of-age', 'gloomy', 'romance', 'young-adult', 'better-than-i-expected', 'printz']"

It’s teasing me, asking me to open it right back up again so I dip my head into the strong, lyrical verses of Marchetta’s writing so I can fall in love and hate with the characters all over again.Taylor Markham is a confused young woman. She was dropped off at some random 7-Eleven when she was just a kid by her druggie mother, and once she left the washrooms, was taken to the Jellicoe School by this woman who, throughout Taylor’s life, becomes the closest thing she has to a mother. But Taylor’s life at the Jellicoe School isn’t so great. Most of the children who attend don’t have families and are there because they’ve got nowhere else to go. Not to mention to territory wars between the two other sects of that area. (Note: this is where I comment on the confusion that takes place in the first 100 pages. Don’t worry; it all clears up later.) Taylor becomes the leader of the territory wars when she’s seventeen, a senior, and months away from graduating, it is finally when life begins to get even more complicated.Taylor was such a strong heroine. Some didn’t like her very much, but I found her voice to be true to her situation and found her quite accurately filling out the shoes for someone in her position. Her actions really made me think – most of the time, it seemed, she was performing an action over talking, but everything she did sufficed in making her life seem believable. At some points in the story, she made me feel like throwing myself in front of a zooming train for her, and during other points, I felt like hugging her to my chest to stop her breaking sobs.Griggs was so magical, so loving and heartbreaking and loyal and fantastic…I couldn’t breathe whenever he spoke. He had some of the most romantic lines I’ve ever read in my entire life, and forgive me, Taylor, but I was just so jealous of you. Griggs was everything you look for in a romantic partner, and even though he had his flaws, he seemed complete to me. Although Marchetta never went out and said he was extremely handsome or anything like that, the way I looked at him was with a blurry line crossing from beautiful to just an average guy whose heart could beat, too, and I loved seeing him like that. The supporting characters were so fabulous, and I’m talking about everyone who was anyone in this book. From Ben to the Mullet Brothers, I was happy (or furious, whichever it called for) with everyone. Although this story was told from Taylor’s POV, a key plot of this book was with a cast one generation older, the cast that makes up everything Taylor needs. I won’t spoil this review in giving away any details, but those supporting characters, and the story they had to share, was absolutely indescribable, and I cried and laughed along with them in turn.Earlier on in this review, I said that there were some foggy, slow part in the book that made others put this down. Although I never really found the story to be moving on too slowly, I will say this book, no matter how beautiful, is not for the impatient. The first 120 pages, before the book really begins to shine, is confusing, muddy, and although well written, just as mind boggling as the emotions that run through Taylor’s body the entire book. Warning: this book also isn’t for those who hate the heavy. Reading this is like dropping a box of hardcover books onto your back and then having to cross a desert with them there – it’s tear-jerking, unexpected, romantic, mysterious and questionable.I loved this book with all my heart and feel like, although I just finished it, reading it again to pick on all those little lines again. The highest praise I can give ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is a five-star rating, but even so, I wish it was more. More like a hundred. JELLICOE ROAD, without telling a lie, is the best book I have ever read, and is absolutely recommended. *Because this book had so many fantastic lines, I’ll share one shining quote with you, the one that stood out the most.“He shakes his head and, although it’s dark, I can tell he’s crying.‘What are you thinking?’ I whisper after a while.‘That you deserve romance,’ he says.Page 237On the Jellicoe Road by Melina MarchettaAudience: 14+ (sex, drugs, alcohol, suicide, and some older youth audience reading)Rating: 5/5 Recommend?: Yes in all languages.

here!
Here's a funny story I want to insert before I write the real review: when I first heard of Jellicoe Road, I immediately thought of that song from the musical Cats, ""...because Jellicoes are and Jellicoes do, Jellicoes do and Jellicoes would..."" I Googled the lyrics and looked for it in Youtube, feeling so cool that I remembered the song and everything, and then I realized it was JELLICLE, not Jellicoe. *facepalm* (By the way, if you're reading this from my blog, I inserted the video of the song below, just in case you want to hear it too! Careful, it gets quite catchy.)Totally unrelated (though hopefully funny) story aside, here's the review! (You: Finally!)Jellicoe Road by Australian author Melina Marchetta is set as a dual narrative, a technique which I have loved ever since I read Holes. It starts out sort of like a puddle of string, entangled in itself, with you hardly knowing what to do with them, but somehow, somewhere along the book these little string ends start finding each other and connecting and forming something beautiful and perfect that absolutely makes sense. It's hard to understand my explanation, but really, it's my subconscious channeling you to read it stat. As you journey with Taylor and Co., everything seems complicated but wait until you read the final pages. Ahh, so that's why this happened. You may find the resolution a bit long, but it's okay because it ties up all the loose ends which leave you in no doubt regarding the fates of the characters, while maintaining a little ambiguity as you wonder what happens to them beyond the book's scope.Feelings-wise, I think this book is so... passionate. Powerful. Intense. It comes across to me that way, not because of the vivid imagery or the intricate plot, but because of all the emotions the characters are feeling. I measure a book by how it evokes feelings in me, and this book takes home all the awards because I think it made me feel everything I could possibly feel at my age. I read this at the end of my college summer semester, where I felt like a prune, numb and empty from all the schoolwork and literally sleepless nights, but this book managed to make me feel good, which is not at all unwelcome (I'm like a grape now. Sorry for the food analogy, I just want to eat some grapes.) Wow, Marchetta.Also, Taylor Markham and Jonah Griggs both possess strong personalities, which definitely adds to the passion + tension + overall intensity of the story in a lot of ways. It makes for an interesting dynamic.But here's the thing: what really did me in was the prose. Marchetta's writing contains a flowy, dreamlike quality that is part witty and part poignant, among other things. It's an interesting combination that manifests itself several times in the text. Like this quote, for example:And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die. But there's a joy and an abundance of everything, like information and laughter and summer weather and so many stories.There are several others, believe me, but I didn't have the foresight to write them down because I was too busy reading everything that I finished the book in a day. It is THAT good. If it is not obvious yet, Jellicoe Road is something I DEFINITELY recommend you to read! The experience is nothing short of magical, as all dreams are, no matter bad or good. :)",9,default,"['2012', '5-stars', 'owned', 'young-adult', 'award-winning']"

It's not like my thoughts on the book have much sway on fellow readers. Original post  here.The connection? No, it wasn't all that difficult to figure out. In fact, I had fun with it. It's just like the matching type examinations in school, way back when. I appreciated the mystery and the hint of suspense, of course. It's one aspect of fiction that I thrive in. And even if I did figure out early on that Melina Marchetta was actually narrating two stories - one from the past, one from the present - and that they will eventually tie up in the end, I enjoyed reading this nonetheless. Jellicoe Road is a heartwarming story about friendship, family, love, death and loss, coming to terms with life's trials, and the ties that bind ~ all the important things that transcend time, space and distance. It's what I truly appreciated about the novel, actually. The author begins the story with something just a tad trivial - territory wars - and then comes out strong in the end with all the stuff that matter. The first half is a meandering mess, but the storyline builds up somewhere in the middle so that by the time you get to the second half of the book, you'll be so hooked you'll be unable to put it down. :) Unfortunately, much as I would like to expound on my observations, I highly doubt that I could give an accurate description without revealing too much of the plot, and we really don't want that. Like Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, this book is highly spoilery (is there such a word?), and I don't want to be the one to kill the fun. The writing wasn't exceptional, but I liked its simplicity and straightforwardness. The characters? Well, there were times when I thought Taylor Markham was such a drama queen, but then I try to put myself in her shoes, and while I know I can never relate to her, I think I can comprehend where all the angst was coming from. Jonah Griggs would never be a ""literary crush"" in a million years, but he is perfect for Taylor, and they sincerely deserved each other. Everyone else - Raffaela, Chaz, Hannah, the Brigadier, etc. - were secondary personalities that helped build and shape Taylor's character. The Great Reveal - well, more like Great Reveal in Installments - didn't shock me as much as I thought it would, however. I think that I read through the chapters more for the purpose of confirming what I already know, and it didn't really blow me away. Still, it tugged at my emotions; the realizations and acknowledgments in the end broke my heart, and I appreciated people's histories and how these can change lives, in a major way. Because, more than anything, Jellicoe Road is Taylor Markham's journey to self-discovery, and the story of acceptance of the people around her.

I'm formally changing my 4 star rating to a 5 star one. I also still love Jonah Griggs with my entire heart.
It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.
It's hard to review a book that you really like because it's so difficult to give it the justice it deserves. Melina Marchetta is an incredibly underrated author, who has a gift for crafting realistic voices for her teen characters. Her characters are flawed and she puts them through the emotional wringer, but Marchetta never allows it to get melodramatic. There's a perfect balance of the exploration of family, friendship, and romance. Marchetta's prose is absolutely beautiful. Seriously, I have so many lines highlighted on my Kobo. I don't really know what to say other than how I loved creatively and beautifully Marchetta wove all of her characters together. All of them are connected in some way, and go on their own emotional journeys. No character in this novel is left one-dimensional. Plus Jonah Griggs is a new favourite literary boy of mine. Just saying. 
Some of my favourite quotes:
“Taylor Markham,"" said Raffaela, ""I'm going to say a prayer for you."" And although I wanted to mock her and explain I didn't believe in anything or anyone, I realised that no one had ever prayed for me before. So I let her.”According to Dickens, the first rule of human nature is self-preservation and when I forgive him for writing a character as pathetic as Oliver Twist, I'll thank him for the advice.“So apart from writing letters home to your fantasy girlfriends,""Ben says, walking backwards, ""what do you guys do out here without television and phones?""""Men's business. Bit confidential,"" Griggs says patronizingly.""Wow, wish I were you,"" Ben says, shaking his head with mock regret. ""All I'll be doing tonight is hanging out in Taylor's bedroom, lying on her bed, sharing my earphones with her, hoping she won't hog all the room because it's such a tiny space.”“What are you so sad about? We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.”",9,default,"['young-adult', 'reviewed', 'standalone', 'own-as-ebook', 'get-your-tissues', 'awesome-heroine', 'awesome-hero', '5-star-reads', 'band-of-friends', 'tw-sexual-assault']"

I already know I'm not going to do it justice...so bare with me, as I try not to butcher it.Jellicoe Road is the past and present coming together to create one manginificently beautiful tale, full of grief and heartache and hope.I'm not gonna lie, this book is a hard hard read. If it's not the interlacing of two different stories, then it's the tragedies that these characters, from two different times, face. Trust me, the writing is pretty much impeccable. The bits of story we get about the past are confusing because Marchetta wants them to be...it's all part of the suspense of the book and ultimately adds to the climax of it. I think the confusion is really just mystery and gives us suspense.I would compare this book to a psychological thriller film. It's one of those where you're like, ""Am I supposed to know what's going on? Because I'm completely lost. Or stupid."" But then at the END it all comes together and makes perfect sense and you can't believe you were oblivious to the brilliance occuring right in fron of you because the whole thing has been amazing!!!!!After I read this, I layed in bed like a comatose patient, unable to move due to an incredible overdose of grief and sadness. It's not that the book has a sad ending, it's just that when I reflected on EVERYTHING these characters had to go through I felt miserable for them. Another confession....I sobbed. Horribly. At least 3 times in this book.It was really an emotional journey that I went on with this book, as cheesy as that may sound to anyone....it's true. A raw, emotional, exhausting journey. This was a hard read because of the content, but worth it and an extremely compelling journey. Seriously, my new favorite book.So do myself, and yourself, and Melinca Marchetta a favor and go out right this minute and buy this book. Lock yourself away and fall into the world of the characters who live on Jellicoe Road.",9,default,"['absolute-favorites', 'books-that-moved-me', 'contemporary-ya']"

 5 AMAZING STARS!
 Quite easy one of the best books I've read this year!
“I live on the Jellicoe Road. Where trees make canopies overhead and where you can sit at the top of them and see forever. My aunt built me a house there. Remember that.”
 Now and then I come across some little book that not everyone is raving about, definitely not the book of the month. It catches my attention when one of my friends is reading it, I add it to my TBR list and soon I forget about it. Few months later it catches my eye again and I do wonder when will I start it. Some other flavour of the month book comes to the scene and once again I let it go. I easily get caught in this race and little gems like this book get forgotten in the never ending TBR pile, but then comes one day when I'm tired and a bit disappointed by these popular books, let down by the hype and reach for the book that has been forgotten.What a revelation! I started reading and instantly loved it. I got invested in it and just couldn't put it down. I got caught in a magical whirlwind and lost myself in a brilliant story. I got emotional, sad, sentimental, I was touched deep down and through teary eyes I reminisced about life, love, friendships, memories and didn't want this book to end, ever. I felt I knew the characters, I felt part of their existence, I wanted to leap into the pages and give them all a big hug and whisper something, anything. These are the signs of a good book for me. I couldn't put it down, I got so involved I lived and breathed with them all, I kept reading and losing myself regardless of the life still going on around me, but at the same time I didn't want the story to end. 
 “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.” 
 Well, let me tell you, this book was definitely a  Journey!This book will have a special place in my heart.",9,default,['top-tbr']

This is a frequently five starred novel, but I think I went into this with all the wrong expectations.The story follows a girl named Taylor Markham who was abandoned by her mother. She is the leader of her house in their war games (a significant plot in the novel), which is complicated by her blossoming romance with Jonah, one of the other leaders. On top of that, the person Taylor is closest to, Hannah, has disappeared, leaving behind snippets of her novel which may contain more truth than fiction.I guess I just assumed this was a contemporary novel written in a normal format, but the way the narrative was structured was extremely confusing to me. Hannah’s story is interspersed with Taylor’s, and for most of the novel I had no clue what the point of Hannah’s story was. It comes together in the end, but as a reader who prefers a more linear format, the way the novel was presented just didn’t work for me.I can see where others got such enjoyment out of this book - it's a highly emotional story, but also ambiguous in a way that can be rewarding once you piece the story together.Despite its strong points, this one just wasn't for me. I personally didn't feel enough of a connection to the characters to feel invested. Coupled with the annoyingly confusing nature of the story, I didn’t get much enjoyment out of this.I also really hated the whole war games plot line - by far the least interesting part of the novel.I’ll say I’m kinda bummed that Jellicoe Road didn’t work for me, since it has been on my TBR for years and one I had always assumed would be a favorite once I actually got my hands on it.Recommended for patient readers who won’t mind being confused for a large portion of the story, as well as fans of YA contemporary that deals with heavy themes.",9,default,['2-star']

As a travel buddy, this book kept me awake. It failed to bore me long enough to leave it inside my bag. In fact, as I was trekking the mountains of Mambukal, I can't help but look for my own Jellicoe road, the type where the canopies of the nearby trees form a tunnel. The type where I would set my eyes on the five friends bonded by fate. Sadly, my gaze did not meet anyone with the eyes that seemed to belong to Narnie but it did not lack smiles through which for a brief moment I connected with. As days crept on, so did my curiosity for these five friends who, I believe are the real heroes and heroines of this novel. This is their history, present and future. Everything that made Jellicoe Road rich in amusing events and games were created by these fab five. Their presence have etched too deep into the hearts of the townpeople including the police, the mayor and etcetera that their lives seemed to eveolve aroudn them. Taylor, the supposed heroine of this story stood out as an important link in the completion of their fate. It felt like I prowled into Taylor's diary who was then retracing her heritage to cope with her identity crisis and occasionally bumping into those entries where she wrote about her crush/lover. I guess, if Marchetta did not explore the story of these five friends, Taylor's diary would be common.This is readable and enjoyable. It does not really evoke change in me or that type that makes me want to get up and run. But it does pinch you in your heart, enough to make you feel that any friendship is not perfect but it truly exist for anyone who wants to leave loneliness alone.",9,default,[]

I opened up to the first page and it was so heartachingly beautiful that a single tear slipped out of my eye. That was nothing compared to how I felt when I finished this. I was actually sobbing- you know the ugly crying where there tears and puffy eyes and snot and wailing? It’s gross but thats about what I looked like. This book is beautiful, emotional puzzle that you, as the reader, are able to piece together as the book progresses. I’ve honestly never read something so emotional in my life and I can’t find a way to express how happy I am that I picked this book up. I was confused, I laughed, I smiled, and as realization kicked in, I cried - oh God did I ever cry. This book changed my life in a way I didn’t completely believe books could. The story alternates between Taylors life at the Jellicoe school with the territory wars, which i’ll be honest are pretty confusing, and the story her guardian, for all intents and purposes, is writing about 5 young kids. I grew so attached to the story Narnie was writing and the kids in it. I loved Taylor and I loved Jonah and, oh gosh I just adored all of them. There wasn’t one character I didn’t like.It’s such a poetic novel. One minute nothing makes sense and the next it all makes sense and it will tear you up I can assure you of that. When I look at my friends reviews on goodreads a lot of you have it marked to-read and I’m telling you right now to stop procrastinating on it and read this book.

On the Jellicoe Road is technically a YA book, and certainly it is a coming-of-age story with adolescent characters. However, the term 'YA' somehow feels pejorative when describing this book because this story (these characters, this plot) just feels bigger than that. This is not a book for lazy readers. It is intricately plotted, weaving between the past and the present, and for the first 100 pages or so it's difficult to grasp all of the characters. The mystery is deliberate, though, and the reader is feeling the same confusion that the book's protagonist Taylor Markham does. Taylor is 17, and the reluctant head of house at a boarding school for children from troubled backgrounds. Her background is complicated, murky, painful; she was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road at age 11 by her drug-addicted mother. Hannah rescued her, but who is Hannah? Friend, guardian, substitute mother? Hannah lives in a half-built school by the river, next door to the school. At the beginning of this story, she disappears - leaving no explanation - and this is part of Taylor's emotional unravelling, but also the catalyst for a journey (both literal and figurative) of self-discovery.The Jellicoe Road School is somewhere out in the bush of Australia, but it borders a town. The Townie kids, the Cadets and the boarding school kids have been engaged for decades in a complicated turf war. There are shades of the Outsiders in this aspect of the novel, although it's not nearly so much about poverty/class - and nor are the divisions between the three groups so insurmountable. Indeed, Taylor has a complicated history with Jonah Griggs - the leader of the Cadets; and her best friend Raffy (a Townie) has a complicated history with Chaz Santangelo, the leader of the Townies. At first I wasn't convinced about this aspect of the plot - I was afraid of a 'Lord of the Flies' scenario - but it is handled so deftly, and Marchetta connects it to the past in a way that is immensely satisfying. The book begins with an accident on the Jellicoe Road: two cars are in a head-on collision, and two families are nearly wiped out. If you do read this book, read this passage carefully. Read it several times, and commit it to memory. The past storyline and the present storyline merge together in a way that is, frankly, ingenious. The emotional impact of it is intense. About halfway though the book, as I began to make connections and predictions, I became intensely invested in Taylor's journey in figuring out who she is and how she is connected to the other characters. In many ways, this is a tragic book; nearly all of the characters in the book are damaged, and it is beyond what is realistic to for them to be made completely whole again. However, it is also a hopeful book - and it takes love, loyalty and friendship very seriously. Adolescence is an emotionally intense time anyway, and this book understands that and gives the reader emotionally intensity which is both authentic and earned. Highly, highly recommended. Marchetta is one of my favourite YA authors, and this book deserves 'classic' status.

The only other five-star book I read in 2012 was Once Was Lost, and that was way back at the beginning of the year-- so I guess you could say I was overdue for an amazing read. In lieu of writing a normal review, I thought I'd make a list of the ten moments or... aspects, I guess, that lingered or stood out in some way. Because, as anyone who's read this book knows, Jellicoe Road is so beautiful and haunting that writing a regular review of it is far too daunting a task. (I didn't include any real spoilers in the review, but I did put some stuff under spoiler tags just to preserve the reading experience as much as possible-- if you click them, it won't ruin the ending or anything.) So without further ado, here are the ten things that, a week after reading, my mind still won't let go of.10. Poor Sam. He breaks my heart, especially because he's probably only 14 or 15 years old himself-- this boy is in desperate need of some help. His role in the book is minimal, but his impact was not.9. Santangelo. (You will be seeing quite a few secondary characters on this list.) His evolution over the course of the novel was natural and gorgeous. I knew from almost the moment he was introduced that I would be keeping an eye on him, and my how that paid off!(view spoiler)[Favorite Santangelo moment:""It's like when I was in year eight and we had to study The Diary of Anne Frank. I mean, she died of typhoid. Can you believe it? How could Anne Frank die of typhoid? The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying, and it was like nothing could kill what was inside of her. I thought, okay, maybe a gas chamber or a firing squad could kill her but not an illness that other people survived.""I'm very disturbed to find out that the leader of the Townies has a soul and I'm beginning to develop a bit of a crush on him.Me, too, Taylor. (hide spoiler)]8. The Prayer Tree. I found it to be a symbol of home for many of the characters, especially Taylor and Raffy. It was a marker of the past and, somehow, the characters were able to connect at the Prayer Tree in a way that they couldn't elsewhere. It brought people together, even when time and prejudice seemed to separate them.7. This quote.He's the most beautiful creature I have ever seen and it's not about his face but the life force I can see in him. It's the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he's saying, ""Here I am, world; are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?"" Except the boy is dead... It makes me want to yell at the God that I wish I didn't believe in. For hogging him all to himself. I want to say, You greedy God. Give him back. I needed him here.This is probably the moment where the tears started forming, and they never really went away.6. I already mentioned Santangelo, but I have not yet dwelt on Raffy. She was a wonderful friend to Taylor, and even more than that I loved watching Raffy and Santangelo's interactions. Loved. Marchetta never clearly spelled out what their history was, but in the end I don't think that was the point. When Santangelo ate Raffy's pickles, I swooned a little. (There's something I never thought I'd say.) 5. The fifth tin. I hate it.4. Oh my oh my the friendships in this book made my little heart melt. There was the perfect mix of hilarious camaraderie and touching earnestness. (view spoiler)[Hilarious camaraderie:""We can give you a lift,"" [Santangelo] says grudgingly. Griggs is looking straight ahead as if he doesn't give a shit.""But just say we get finger marks on the seats?"" I ask. ""Can we borrow your hanky?""Raffy and I are both amused by my humour.""Just don't touch anything.""Touching earnestness:Do I remember what Raffaela said in the car park of the Evangelical church?""Who do I believe in?"" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. ""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""So beautiful. The interactions of Taylor, Jonah, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben made me alternately laugh and sigh. (hide spoiler)] 3. Taylor's voice was unique and I loved being in her head. She has this wry sense of humor that is so engaging, and I was quite drawn to her no-nonsense attitude, prickly personality, and the way she tried to suppress her own longings. 2. The magical realism of Taylor's dreams was just... gah. So good. The boy in the tree, the wailing-- it was all so haunting and really got under my skin.1. Hee hee... this will strike most of you as a strange favorite aspect of the book, but for some reason I was drawn to the silly little rivalry between Griggs and Ben. I think it was because they both were important to Taylor, yet had completely different personalities, Jonah being self-contained and intense, Ben being sarcastic and self-deprecating. (Loved. Ben.) There is nothing I would love more than to see a burgeoning bromance between these fine young men.(view spoiler)[For this reason, one of my favorite, favorite parts of the book was when Griggs saw Ben playing the violin and kinda-sorta apologized for messing up his fingers earlier. Hello there, let me just type out the entire exchange because it lights up my soul.When it's time for Ben to play his solo-- his eyes closed, his mind anywhere but here, his fingers so taut and precise that it almost looks painful-- my eyes well with tears. Because you know from the look on Ben's face that he's somewhere you want to be... The place goes off. I can feel Griggs's shoulder against mine and I hear him mutter something under his breath.""What?"" I say, irritated. ""He's fantastic.""There's a look on his face that I don't recognise and I don't quite get it until Ben jumps off the stage, surrounded by Townie girls.""Hey!"" Griggs calls out to him. ""Violin guy!""Ben points to himself with that who me? look, walking towards us.Griggs doesn't say anything for a moment, but then he clears his throat. ""If I had known... I wouldn't have gone for your fingers that time.""D'awwwww.Also, in my frenzy of obsession upon finishing the book I read tons of interviews from MM. In one, she delivered this shocking revelation: Ben and Jonah will one day be roommates. I read that and then fell over dead with cuteness and wonder. Goodbye everybody, I must go pray fervently for a short story to someday be published detailing their life and times together in Waterloo. Ahhhh.

I'm not articulate enough but still, let me try. Melina Marchetta has written a book about two sets of young people who have lost much in life. Taylor Markham is abandoned by her mother at eleven outside a 7/11, to be picked up by a complete stranger and placed in a boarding school called the Jellicoe School. She grows up having no identity because the two people who should give her one are gone. She spends the next six years being angry and aloof and not allowing herself to become too hopeful about good things. Narnie, Webb and Tate lose their parents at twelve when their cars collide in a terrible accident out on the Jellicoe road. They are left to fend for themselves, along with their new psycho-hero-friend Fitz and the ever reliable Jude. A tragic story for all of them and I was sad, I really was but I was surprised that the strongest emotion I felt was envy. I was envious of them. Not for having suffered so much, but for having each other. They are left alone with no one to guide them or love them. So they guide and love each other instead. What I love about Marchetta's writing, and I've loved it ever since reading Saving Francesca, is how harrowing her stories are but she smooths the edges of impact by doing it with gentle hands. Its subtle and simple but so painfully honest that its elegant. Its not fancy words but what she observes; its how she sees the world that makes her writing poetic, not necessarily the way she's telling her story. Taylor, and again I felt this way about Francesca and Tom in The Piper's Son, is a specific part of us. She's that quality that makes us react against those who care about us, that makes us push them away because we don't want to seem vulnerable. We piss them off but inside we're praying they see through it and realize that we do need help, and more than that, we're lonely and can't live without them. We throw everything we have at them but hope they'll be the ones to crack the walls we've trapped ourselves in. She's our anger, uncertainty and aloneness and yearning. And then Taylor does us a favor and she cracks. She breaks open completely and demands from the world everything she wants. She demands and takes and in then end, I hope she wins. I know this isn't making sense anymore so if you'd like to move on, feel free to leave me here. I'll keep going, if you don't mind, until I've unloaded all I have in my head and my chest because I just, have to. Marchetta writes an adolescence I wish I had the guts to have had. Her characters are so well-drawn. From Taylor, Raffaela, Santangelo and Jonah Griggs to Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude and Fitz...its quite a group to keep track of. But you do because when they come on the page, they're not characters but feelings. Sad feelings, a lot of the time, but strong and they won't let you forget them. To expose yourself in the way they do, what they reveal of themselves to each other is both admirable and enviable (that word again). Let's just say, its hard enough to do as an adult. I certainly didn't speak so unreservedly and meditatively about myself at that age. But I wish I had. It all comes back to this quote (which if you’re not too anal isn’t really a spoiler) (view spoiler)[
  
""We end up with the Townies and Cadets at the McDonald's on the highway at two in the morning. I look around at everyone and can't help thinking how normal we look and I don't think I've ever felt normal. I watch Raffy as she removes the pickles from her hamburger and hands them over to Santangelo without them exchanging a word, and I realize there is more to that relationship than spelling bees and being enemies. These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking. Jonah Griggs takes my hand under the table and links my fingers with his, and I know I would sacrifice almost anything to keep this state of mind, for the rest of the week at least.""

(hide spoiler)]. Its about belonging and I think that's ultimately what Marchetta is writing about. Don't get me wrong, this book is overflowing with serious life lessons. She talks about sacrifice, acceptance, redemption, guilt, keeping promises, perseverance, so many things. But belonging and solace, she says it right there in Chapter One. Throughout the story we find Taylor belonging more than she thought she did to people and places she never would've guessed. And the ending ends peacefully enough. As much peace that can be gotten from all the tragic events she puts her characters through.With all of that said, its not a perfect novel. But what is, I ask you. What is! Yes, like many complain, its a rocky start. But you survive. I love the opening lines so much that I would've endured a hundred more pages of jerky narrative. The plot was impressively tied together. The mysteries, however, weren't quite as mysterious. I would call many of the plot twists early on after which I would smack myself for my own damn cleverness. The territory wars...a melodramatic ploy, in my honest opinion. It was all a very long laugh that they took too seriously. But Taylor's inevitable connection to it later in the novel is sweetly satisfying. Another point to Marchetta's well-connected dots! This novel is just impossible to put down. Its not that you force yourself to stay awake, its more like you sit and read and forget to stop. You think a minute has gone by but suddenly you’re squinting your eyes because the light has dimmed. Has the sun set already? I still don’t know if Jellicoe is real, or if there is a Jellicoe school that served as inspiration for her novel, but all of these characters found something of themselves in this seemingly inconsequential town...to commemorate a place like that the way she does is amazing. Its as if any place in the world can suddenly be beautiful. I try to stay away from grand proclamations because I’m constantly changing my mind and so my feelings and opinions shift in kind, but such gestures are to be expected when you read someone as good as Melina Marchetta. So I’ll say this now, she’s my favourite young adult writer, full stop. A few come a very close second, like Malorie Blackman and Carolee Dean, both to whom I’m devoted after only one book and J.K. Rowling, of course. How can I not when she owns my entire childhood, which she keeps in pretty jars along with the rest of the childhoods of my generation? (Also, to be fair, I’ve only just this year started reading YA, so I’m sure there are hordes of other great authors for me to discover).And finally I think the reason why I love and envy Marchetta so much is that she writes compellingly the very stories I wish I could.",8,default,"['this-shelf-is-divine', 'identity-and-psychology', 'ok-fine-its-ya', 'goosebumps', 'hit-me-in-the-heart', 'own', '21st-cent']"

That’s the trouble when I read stories discussing the issues of teenagers. Good thing this book talked about values of friendship and family, or else I couldn’t find anything good to like about this book. I can imagine negative comments on this review, and yeah, bring it on.What I don’t like in the story:The reader will be introduced to the territory wars between the Townies and the Cadets, through the story telling of Taylor Markham. That is where most of the story will revolve. I don’t appreciate that part of the story; it’s like a stupid scheme to be implemented in a boarding school. I know it’s hard for me to relate on that side of the story since I didn’t get to live in a boarding school, but I’ve heard enough of the territory wars, even the small scale one. It may be a good component to a new storyline, but to be reading numerous chapters just to discuss about territory wars, which doesn’t have any strategic ideas against the other troop, only a story of falling in love with the enemy is tiring. It’s like I want to pull the hairs of the girls and pinch the boys on their sides to tell them to be serious on their business, and studies.Taylor will eventually search for her guardian, Hannah, which somehow confused me. She doesn’t seem to mind the existence of Hannah, so what’s with the sudden eagerness to find her? I think Taylor’s character is too dysfunctional that her emotional attachment to Hannah is as confusing as her character. It can be said that she’s trying to keep herself detached from anyone, but I hope she showed a little heart since she’s speaking in the story. It could be a positive side to the story telling, but I find it annoying. I know it’s only me.A boy in the tree, the Hermit, the Brigadier, Hannah, Jonah Griggs, the serial killer, Santangelo, the Prayer Tree, the Club house, the territory wars. They are all put together to create twist and confusion to the story, which eventually will be put in order as the story unfolds. Sounds exciting, it sounds thrilling, a page-turner one can say, but I say annoying, and trying-hard. I think the author tried too hard to put confusing aspects of the story to put suspense and mystery. It’s a good factor in the story telling, but I think it wasn’t written at the right place and time. I don’t know, I may be wrong, but that is what I feel. Throw stones on me now.Taylor’s coldness and stiffness annoyed me more. Her character is too cold, inside and out, that it’s kind of hard to understand her interest on other people’s business. Her concern on Hannah looks fake, and her falling in love with the enemy is stupid. She is also so eager to find her real parents, but her emotion was too shallow to understand her purpose.See, it’s hard for me to appreciate stories written about teenagers. I know I’m talking like I wasn’t a teenager once, but I am confident to say I wasn’t as annoying and stupid as these characters.What I like about the story:If I don’t like Taylor, then what three stars are for? It’s for the story of friendship and value of family that the story tackled.Italicized portion of the book will introduce the reader to another story. One may find it confusing, but only if you would not pay much attention to the early part of the story. Honestly, I like the italicized part better than the story of Taylor and her dysfunctional leadership in the territory wars.The italicized part is not just any story of a manuscript but a story taking account of one of the character’s story. I must say that part is well written and thank goodness to this part, the rest of Taylor’s silly storytelling was put in order. This part talks about the friendship of 5 friends from the boarding school, who originally started the territory wars. So, yes, it explains the silly territory wars the group of Taylor is engage into. The five friends were united by the accident in Jellicoe Road, and a friendship tight enough to keep them together started. The 5 friends experienced different issues in their younger years, but they remained supportive of each other. They grew up, lived a life away from each other but their lives are still tangled altogether. Their friendship keeps them connected at one point to another. And that is what I appreciate in this story. I remember my friends, and the unwritten rule of loyalty we once made. I remember the faces of my good friends who’ve been my confidantes since grade school, my close friends from the teenage years, and those I met in the University. This part of the book is close to my heart. It’s a rare gem to find friends who will stay with you up to the end. The friends who will remain by your side to lift you up when you’re down. And the italicized part didn’t fail to convey that heartwarming message of friendship and importance of family.I feel the need to acknowledged Manchetta’s effort to intertwine the story of 5 friends to Taylor’s own story. There are twist and turns, suspense and intrigued, and practically the end eventually justified the means. Though I still can’t help but hope that Taylor’s character was given more depth, and I know there’s a better way to tell us the connection of the 5 friends and Taylor’s life. I really find the emotions I feel for Taylor’s character were too shallow, for me to even appreciate her existence to the storyline.",8,default,['the-child-in-me']

This is one of her books, that has been heaped with praise, so I thought it would be a great next book.I must say, the book was a journey, for both me and the characters. I went from ""this is weird"" to ""what the heck is happening"" to ""THIS IS AMAZING!"". There was this beautiful story of connection, forgiveness, love, and friendship wrapped up in a mystery. Taylor had been abandoned on Jellicoe Road at age eleven, and more or less, cared for by Hannah, whose disappearance set the whole story in motion. In her search, Taylor found Hannah's manuscript, and though it seemed random at the time, she was soon able to draw parallels between the fictional lives of the characters and her own.At the same time, Taylor was leading her team in the annual boundary battle between her school, the townies, and the cadets. Alliances formed, and grew into something quite wonderful. These unlikely friendships brought me so much happiness, and it meant a lot to me, that Taylor found her people.As Taylor found more and more clues in her search for Hannah, I watched all the pieces fall into place, and then, all the feels were unleashed on me. Once it started, I couldn't stop the avalanche of emotions that began filling me up. There were lots of tears as it all became clearer, but there was a lot of joy in there too.I had to be patient, and let Marchetta lay the foundation for this wonderful tale.

Now about the book and how I felt while and after reading. I was looking forward to read this book for ages. I had read so many 5-star reviews to this book that it never occured to me that I could be not charmed by it. The weird thing is, I tried to love it. I honestly did my best to find a way into the story and warm up for the characters and learn to love and suffer with them. Unfortunately, I didn't find my way into the story. The first 100 pages or so were meant to be confusing, well, to me they weren't. I sensed such a connection after, like 50 pages, and when everything came clear I just inwardly nodded and shrugged, because it was a bit obvious to me, really. Why else would an author connect two stories like that? And why else make them so ""tragic""? The two main story-lines seemed a bit weak to me, by the way. I was highly annoyed with the war games. They seemed pathetic and useless to me, because well, they really had no use except for bringing Taylor and Griggs together. I actually wondered how people come up with such stupid games and ideas, while reading, I wondered whether there are people in the real world who act the way the characters acted. If such people exist I am persuaded that I should avoid these people, for otherwise the urge to strangle somebody may turn out to be stronger than my self-control. Taylor was pathetic. To me she was just pathetic and that's absolutely it. One second she was all analytic and serious and icy and the next she turned into an 'emotional' mess who hid somewhere in the corner. She was chewing on her 'problems' the whole bloody time instead of doing something, or accepting the past and getting over it and just living. It felt like Taylor was walking circles over and over again and I just wanted to slap her, hard, and walk away. What use is there from moping over your ""terrible-terrible"" life in your room? There is the world, there are responsibilities, things that have to be done.Her relationship with Griggs wasn't any better. It was 
beyond weird
 and completely unrealistic to me. No real romance, and definitely no chemistry at all. Hannah could have acted in a more grown-up manner too, but well, I didn't judge her. As for the other characters... Well, they weren't anything special, expect maybe the one who was always mentioned and remembered, but never appeared. I couldn't make out a real plot in this book. Just a story moving really really really slow. I wasn't exactly bored, but I was 
impatient
 and just wanted it to end as soon as possible after about 70% of the book. Exasperated. That's the word for how I felt. To the majority of the people the write style of this author seems magical, amazing...whatever. To me it is forced, difficult to swallow and weird. It doesn't get me, I cannot get into a story with such a write style, it is like a dead text to me. The whole story with all its characters and places and descriptions and plot twists felt unrealistic, forced and 
'un-alive'
. As if the author tried hard to be unique and impressive and failed. I'm sorry, really, but the whole time while reading I felt either like shrugging or rolling my eyes. The face I made the most while reading (like 80% of the time): ",8,default,"['i-prefer-rum', 'hate-the-heroine']"

Little accidental foray into the YA world for me, and my feelings are mixed.I see why it can feel satisfying to gradually piece together a story from a set of ambiguous puzzle pieces; for me, though, it's a style that often makes me feel alienated. I usually like to be grabbed immediately and to feel like I'm living inside the book, not to find myself scratching my head and saying, ""What's happening here?"" And because I'm like that I often end up detaching from books like these and failing to figure things out, as much out of emotional distance as out of the book's actual ambiguity. Occasionally, though, the style works for me and I feel really brilliant for having solved the puzzle and satisfied that I stuck with the book. This particular experience fell right in the middle of those two poles. What appears to be the main plotline of the book is pretty unclear at first, and is interspersed with insets from an even murkier subplot where you really have no idea who's talking or what's happening. Of course, the two stories are connected and the hows and whys of that gradually unfold -- a little too gradually for my taste. To the book's credit, though, I did stick with it and was rewarded -- mostly -- by increasing clarity after the halfway point or so. I might reread it and appreciate it more the second time around, if I cared enough to do so.I will say that the plot, once it finally unfolded, was pretty brilliant. Some of the characters and their dilemmas were interesting, although I never really felt like I knew any of them well. The romance was a bit too crafted for my tastes; the guy was that oh-so-perfect balance of tough and sensitive, macho yet emotionally available for the heroine. Yawn. I also get a little tired of the whole I-want-you-but-I'm-too-proud-to-let-you-know-so-I'll-just-endure-my-own-private-heartbreak-until-someone-hits-me-over-the-head thing.I'm not usually a YA fan and this book didn't convert me, its merits notwithstanding.

Having been abandoned by her mother at age 11, her erratic, mercurial and depressed moods does not make her a favourite among leaders. When Hannah, her mentor and guardian disappears, Taylor is burdened with the anxiety and the numerous questions that come with it. To top off her worries, there is a territory war going on between the Townies (kids populating Jellicoe Road) and the Cadets, who visit for 6 weeks each year for training. In the search for answers, Taylor not only uncovers mysteries regarding her mother and Hannah, but begins to mature and develop her identity.Meanwhile, a story from the past of 5 friends, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Narnie and Tate, is being told. At first, these storylines seem completely irrelevant and unrelatable, but as the story develops, the past and present collide.Placed in the middle of a muddled town, Melina Marchetta left me completely baffled. However, in the midst of confusion and tragedy, the story continues to surge forward, and as questions were answered, I found myself lost in the captivating worlds of Jellicoe Road. Taylor’s coming of age is evident, especially after a beautiful, bittersweet ending. On the Jellicoe Road ends with life, identity, and characters, laughter, death and a road that will be remembered.This book is highly recommended for all. Melina Marchetta’s powerful use of words and breathtakingly beautiful moments differentiates good books from excellent, and will reside in your heart.",8,default,[]

This one's tricky to understand how I feel about it... On the one hand, the lyrical writing hits me deep in the feels many times and makes me laugh. I also feel so in awe of the complex plotting that Melina Marchetta did. On the other hand, the format/structure felt clunky and I couldn't really get into the story until about halfway in when I felt like I finally got at least a grip on how the dual narratives might connect. The idea of the territory wars then felt quite abandoned halfway through too, when I don't even know how I felt about this elaborate territory war game thing yet. But the twists were twisty surprising and the characters were quite diversely unique. I love the characters Raffy and Chaz, and Taylor was interesting. In the end I think the biggest thing that bugged me was how melodramatic the book was... It got too sad, like for the sake of inserting some drama into the story. Taylor cried so much, had panic attacks so much, and I couldn't balance her magical dreams with the forcefully realistic sadness. Great to see Melina Marchetta get ambitious and develop her writing, but for the book among all she has written that gets the most raved reviews, I definitely prefer her others. ",8,default,[]

I finished this book last night and I WEPT through the last few chapters! My heart has been ripped out of my chest. My God, this book! This book is BREATHTAKING! This book is a triumph! It is that truly rare gem that you know will forever redefine excellence in your mind, and every other “great” book will now be compared to, and you already know will likely pale in comparison to. This book is the BEST YA novel I have ever read. This book may be one of the best books I have EVER read in my LIFE!Honestly, I don’t have the words to describe the astonishing beauty that is this story and this prose. What a privilege it was to have this reading experience! What a privilege it was to know these characters! What a privilege it was to be captivated by this gorgeous prose! A friend of mine who’s an avid reader had been recommending this book to me for years! I wish I had listened to her much earlier! This book should have been my absolute priority! When I finally started reading it, I was very confused! I spent the first 25% of the book not knowing what is going on. In fact, I read the first 25% twice, in hopes of finding some important info I had missed the first time. Then I got very nervous that I’m not going to like the book because it doesn’t make sense and I’m going to disappoint my friend by going back and saying I have no idea what she liked about this book! O, Ye of Little Faith! I needn’t have worried one bit! Every single sentence here has a purpose. Every single piece of the puzzle will masterfully fall into place. It all comes together BEAUTIFULLY! I don’t really want to talk about the plot. In my opinion, it’s best to go into this book knowing as little as possible about it. And if you really need to know what the story is about, it’s been discussed in great detail by so many other reviewers. I’d rather talk about how it made me FEEL all the feelings. Suffice to say that the book explores some heavy themes, but at its heart, it is a coming of age story; a story about finding who you are and where you belong, and where you long to be. it’s a story about devastating heartbreak, loneliness, immense loss, but also resilience, the absolute healing power of friendships, the beauty of first love, and the places and people who make us feel like we are home.This book has a complex plot, one that is structured intricately. There are dual narratives and a large cast of characters. You could say there’s a lot going on, and the book is under 300 pages! But what you have to understand is that this is not your average run of the mill YA. You’re in the hands of a true genius! This is a rich and complicated tale. And it’s very sophisticated, both in the themes it explores, and in the art of storytelling. The author seamlessly moves between the dual narratives, and slowly, slowly, unravels the mystery elements and unspools the thread that will connect all the pieces.By the end, you’ll sit there, absolutely stunned. Not just by how the dual narratives come together perfectly and harmoniously, but by the small details, the subtle connections that truly take your breath away. You’ll come to find that nothing was wasted here. That every little comment, every tidbit of info, and every thought was there for a reason, and they all create such a tsunami of emotions within you! The prose is truly hauntingly beautiful. Melina Marchetta is an astonishing wordsmith! Few can do what she has done here! Very few!It is extraordinary how the author manages such a large cast of characters so masterfully. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, and I couldn’t help but to care about each and every one of them. God, I don’t remember having read many books where I fell so deeply in love with so many of the characters, even the minor ones. And the punchy dialogues! They were so real. I giggled reading some of them. But then again, I also cried many times, reading Taylor’s narration of her story. What an emotional rollercoaster this was!This book did something to me. It sliced through my heart, cut a piece of it, and stole it forever! This is a book I will never forget! One I suspect I will come back to again in the future. This book deserves to be read by all, and not just young adults. Not the likes of Twilight, which for some incomprehensible reason steals the spotlight. This is the caliber YA literature should be.I kneel before you  Melina Marchetta. You’ve bewitched me. You’ve somehow bottled up magic and served it up in this 300-page package. Thank you for this book! We are not worthy!5 shiny starts, but only because the GoodReads scale cannot do this book justice! P.S: I know this book was written before the age of hashtags on social media, but can we make this hashtag a thing? #JonahGriggsForever",7,default,[]

Melina Marchetta’s The Jellicoe Road was the first contemporary Young Adult novel I’ve read, and to be honest, I was not sure what to expect. The story started with a shock, the car accident involving the Schroeders and the Markhams, and I asked myself, will this be one of those sad and tragic stories? Then it was revealed that it was part of a manuscript that the narrator, Taylor Markham, was reading. The setting of Taylor’s world was quite unfamiliar: the school system in Australia, the Houses, the Townies and Cadets, some of the terminologies that were used, all of these for me needed a little of getting used to. I’ve already gone by the first 5 chapters yet I was still not sure how I can get into the story. I felt like an outsider looking in while reading Taylor’s narration and I was not sure if I really care what these kids were going through with their school struggles and seemingly pointless territory wars. My interest was more attuned to the manuscript: the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude felt like it has a lot more grounding since I was a witness to the friendship they forged amidst a horrific tragedy. Then I was in the part in Taylor’s timeline where Hannah left suddenly and Taylor could no longer contain herself and she just needed to confront the principal about it. She revealed that she hated the thought of appearing weak in the eyes of the other students even though deep inside, she felt weak without Hannah. It felt like I understood Taylor a little bit for the first time, for who hasn’t even once in their lives hid what they were really feeling inside, pretending as if everything was ok.I thought there was an inverted contrast between the struggles of the Fab 5 in the manuscript and Taylor: For Taylor, who was having trouble trusting anyone because of her past, her life-question was: how can I trust anyone ever again? Those who were involved in the accident needed each other to survive. For Narnie and the rest, their life-question was: How can we live if we didn’t trust each other to hold us up? Thematically, I thought this was where both worlds would converge, that through friendship, they would find their own self-worth. But not everything’s as neat and ideal as I expected. The novel was dedicated to unfold tragedy after tragedy, and everything began to unravel because of the disappearance (and death) of Webb. Webb was the lynchpin of the Fab-5’s friendship, he was the one holding everyone up, the one who’s passion for life inspired them to continue living. Without him, the consequences were disastrous: Tate left suddenly, Fitz became crazy, Narnie and Judd both harbor guilty feelings about what happened.There was this scene where Narnie and Judd was talking in the river. Narnie said that if Webb disappeared, there will be no one left for her, and she felt she might disappear, and Judd was the only one who was making her feel that her existence has substance and reality. That was a beautiful portrayal about how friendship matters to some people: the presence of others, especially their connection to us, helps ground our existence, the glance of the friend confirms that we are alive, that we are somebody worth it worth it worth it!At first I was disappointed with how the story was progressing in the case of the 5 friends. I thought that in spite of their friendship, they were unable to see their own self-worth, that the friendship didn't give them the strength to survive and flourish. Especially Tate, I thought, how could she leave so suddenly, and how does that honor Webb’s death? Upon further reflection, that was what I wanted to see, but what was the novel actually trying to show? Instead of in spite of, I realized they were able to form friendships that could last a lifetime despite what they've been through. How much could we say about our own lives?It was obvious that there was a connection between the 5 and Taylor’s world. When all of these connections were slowly revealed, Taylor’s issue on trust was being put to the test. Jonah Griggs was her main gateway to recover that capacity to trust again, Raffy and Chaz were the supporting pillars of that gate. Truth be told, I was imagining what my impression is if I met Taylor in person. Without knowing her history, I probably wouldn’t like her because of her moods and attempts to push people away and piss them of in the process. This novel reminded me to always look at a person without judging eyes for we never know what his or her story is. I find the author’s writing style fascinating and frustrating at the same time, it was descriptively sparse and half-the-time muted, it is as if the reader was watching a scene outside a window draped with translucent curtains, never revealing the whole scenery, bending the light and obstructing small portions of the unfolding story. There were some things that the book was silent about that I would have loved to know: how did Taylor react when she was found out that Fitz was the one who killed her father? How did Tate react when she found out about this, or did she ever know? What was going on inside Narnie the whole time that she lost her brother, how did she manage to be strong all of a sudden?Another thing that I liked about the novel was the dream scenes that Taylor included in her narration. I thought dreaming in the novel was how the author showed that people we love who have already passed-on never really left us. A touching moment was when Fitz was finally reconciled with Webb through Taylor and her dream. It is as if to say, some friendships do endure even beyond this world. Even with all the tragedies and the traumas the characters endured throughout the novel, most especially Tate and her daughter, this is one of those books that ended so gracefully and satisfyingly. Taylor, who had trust issues from the start, dropped her insecurities and found the grace of forgiving her mom. Through the inevitable darkness of death, both daughter and mom found intimacy and freedom. Narnie, who had lost her ability to wonder after the car accident, through the healing of belongingness and friendship, finally regained that which speaks volumes: peace within herself and hope for the ever surprising renewal and enchanting journey towards tomorrow.Here are some of the lines in the novel that I really love:“See, I remember love. That’s what people don’t understand. And what I also remember is that in telling that tale to the Cadet on the train I got a glimpse of peace.” – Taylor“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well they can tell what I’m thinking.” – Taylor“Webb was grinning. Tate, too. They always grinned in unison. Like they were thinking the same mind, sharing the same heart.” – Hannah Manuscript“And then you came along and you spoke to me and nobody had looked at me in the eye for years.” – Jonah talking to Taylor“And he knew that, but all his life he’d been treated like crap to the point that he believed that he was crap. He’d never done anything good and nobody had ever said anything positive to him. But that night, on the Jellicoe Road, it was like he was reborn. The lives he saved gave him purpose and he loved those kids more than anything.” Taylor telling the story of Fitz“I remember love. It’s what I have to keep on reminding myself. It’s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that’s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It’s not the pain they’re getting over, it’s the love.” – Taylor“Then we spoke about our dreams and how we always felt safe in them, no matter how bad everything else seemed.” – Taylor talking about the Hermit“I want to yell out to everyone, “It’s a game, these territory wars. They loved each other.” – Taylor“I’m here because of you. You’re my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime.” – Jonah to Taylor“But living in the heart of Narnie was the only home he had ever had. Deep down he knew he wasn’t enough to keep Narnie alive for the rest of her life. But he could try.” – Jude“What are you thinking?” I whisper after a while. “That you deserve romance,” he says.” Taylor and Jonah“Naw. You just have to belong. Long to be.” “By blood?” “By love,” Narnie said, without looking up. – Jude, Fitz and Narnie“If you close your eyes, you get to control your own darkness,” Jude tells Santangelo.“If I want more, I need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all my might, and do the best I can with it.” – Taylor“I want to tell them that the brilliance of that memory of lying between them won’t be easily surpassed and that the stories of their love for each other touch me in a way I didn’t think possible.” – Taylor about Hannah and Jude“But my mother said she wouldn’t die until she had something to leave her daughter.” – Taylor about Tate",7,default,"['young-adult', '2012-reads']"

I don't think I'm satisfied with this. Will revise eventually, especially after I'm done with my rereading. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This feels more like a dream.Meet the tenacious Taylor Markham. She's a girl with issues. Not issues like who she's going to go to the dance with, nor like contemplating the next move in the chess game she's about to win, by the way. These are deep-seated issues, like looking for a mother in the drugged figure who changes her name every time they move, or facing a terrible lonesomeness amongst people she doesn't quite know to be a friend or a foe.This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like, to quote a song title, a beautiful disaster. I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow. Very raw, very deep. It cuts into the very soul; it's about that hidden side of us we don't want the world to see (and which it turns its back upon - ironically, sometimes just when we need it the most). This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side. Really, it's quite the emotional roller coaster - it will make you cry, laugh, cuss and dream, all in the same page.Essentially, this isn't a book that invites you to keep those rose-colored glasses on. This is a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. { Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like a very personal journal of a girl, trying in vain to keep herself sane. There is here some talk of the most sensitive subjects: teenage pregnancy, drugs, poverty, prostitution, murder, depression. These are, however, merely mentioned in course as seemingly everyday objects - which, in truth, they are. { This may also serve as a reminder that it never hurts to look twice at the dark alley or the sleeping figure on the train; they may very well be linked to us in a way we may never know. }However, as bleak as the world seems, Marchetta does offer us something to hold on to. It may be just a few words carved in the tallest tree, or a song quietly repeating in a dream, but there's always something good to look forward to behind the bad.There's always wonder.Other notes:I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow. Very raw, very deep. It cuts into the very soul; it's about that hidden side of us we don't want the world to see (and which it turns its back upon - ironically, sometimes just when we need it the most). This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side (get ready for a roller coaster there!).About halfway, I somehow felt that I didn't (or couldn't) like this book - but then I realized that it was because I saw a lot of parts in me here that I 1) shun today, and 2) tried (and trying!) hard to change. To see those little behaviors and feelings that used to be how I operated and felt suddenly made me understand that what I was going through, while I was in the same stage as Taylor (though, of course, not of her circumstances!), was not as unique as I thought. I wasn't alone in that sense, though I felt back then that I was. I disliked being brought back there - but, hey!, it's a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical.",7,default,[]

Those who are regular readers of Persnickety Snark know that I am a HUGE Melina Marchetta fan because she's a talented writer, she has created many intensely personal and real characters and I think she's the bee's knees as a human being as well. This is biased. But then again the Printz award, and the plethora of other awards she's won for this title and the others, show that (perhaps) I have exceptional taste.Jellicoe is my beloved. I adore it. I have read it many times and recently listened to it as my first ever audiobook experience. I can't objectively review it anymore. So instead of writing a proper review, I am writing down the twelve reasons I love it.1. At first it has a more confusing structure than the Christopher Nolan movie, Momento. Relax and let all the carefully crafted threads start weaving into a tapestry of awesomeness. The results? A scene that will squish your heart into minced meat. It also makes Jellicoe Road a fantastic book to re-read multiple times as you always pick up something new.2. Shows that tween girls really are terrifying and that they can make teen boys quake in their boots.3. All of Marchetta's boys are crushable. But she has a way with kissing scenes...don't believe me, check this out - ""When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already."" Melting yet?4. Jonah Griggs, the MOST compelling tortured love interest in YA. He's not supernatural, he's just supernaturally divine. He's an ass, a joker, a tough nut, a sensitive soul and a great snogger. He's also kitted out in fatigues most of the time. He's perfection in his detailed imperfection. Only he could swear at a girl and still make you swoon.5. The band. Don't want to ruin it but if you've read the book you know why. Comic relief in mullet form.6. The past - heart wrenchingly awful and beautiful in one clearly imagined intro. The rest is gravy.7. Hannah - the heart of the book and one half of the soul of the book. Her story and that of the one she loves, is just....ahhhhh.8. Territory wars. Forget Hogwarts and Voldermort, that's child's play. See what happens when boarders, townies and cadets battle over territory. Enormously fun, sometimes brutal and a great use of the Aussie bush.9. Santangelo and Raffy. He might be a bully and a cad and a hardheaded mule but his bickering with Raffy cracks me up. He's a good sort and she's a fabulously strong, maternal, uncompromising chick in a completely different way than Taylor.10. The way in which grief, desertion and family are all integrated so beautifully with love, friendship, war and identity. Big ideas but delicately crafted.11. The boy in the tree.12. Taylor Markham.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, and when it started I suspected a hint of dystopia, with weird dream-like interludes (because, seriously, it’s hard to find a YA book at the moment that’s not dystopian!). Not so. I'll admit the first few chapters are confusing and you may be tempted to put the book down - DON’T DO IT!!! It all becomes clear, and then you can sit back and enjoy the ride. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting (at 2am this morning in fact, which may explain why I'm having trouble stringing sentences together at the moment). The story is set around the life of Taylor Markham, the 17 year old newly elected ‘leader’ of a boarding school on Jellicoe Road. Taylor was abandoned by her mother when she was 11, and her only recollection of her father is riding on his shoulders. The only adult influence in her life is her mentor Hannah, who lives in an unfinished house by the river and who has suddenly vanished into thin air.To top all of Taylor’s problems off, there is a territory war about to start between the boarders, the Townies (kids from the Jellicoe Town) and the Cadets (a group of boys who come for a 6 week training exercise every year to Jellicoe). The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother. The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again.Running parallel to Taylor's story is the story that Hannah has been writing, about five kids who grew up in the town 20 years ago. This story is shown in pieces throughout the novel. I loved the way the two stories (past and present) were interwoven. Even though you start to figure out how it all fits together as you read, it doesn't ruin the storyline at all, in fact I found that it enhanced the story as it all meshed together and I started to understand how everything related. I also loved the story of the territory war. Not only because it made for some good laughs but also how it starts as one thing and changes into something else as the story progresses and the characters come together. I don't know where to start with the characters, they were all so real, and each a product of what they had endured in the past. Of course the back stories are slowly revealed throughout the book so you don’t know why they are the way that they are, sometimes until the very end. It was amazing to watch the characters change as their relationships developed and they came to terms with their past. I particularly loved the characters of Taylor, Griggs and the Brigadier - from the beginning you just know that each of them are much more than what they seem. The 5 kids from Hannha’s story and the secondary characters Chaz, Raffy, and the rest of the kids from the boarding school, are well fleshed out and add to the story. I’d recommend this book to everybody. Lots of laughs, and a few tears as well. A fantastic book by a great Australian author.

I've had years to marinate over the (nearly) unanimous love for this book. It has a tendency to raise expectations, you know. So maybe if I'd read it years back, I wouldn't have found it good, emotionally effective, but a bit disappointing.The first 100 or so pages were kind of a slog. I very nearly checked out more than once. I simply wasn't interested in the turf wars between Boarders, Townies, and Cadets. It all seemed so silly, so entirely overblown, that something that lasts only a few weeks would have such an incredibly high importance for everyone involved. It's not like these are rival schools, just across town, not entirely. The Cadets are only in town for about two months a year and surely have other things to do with their time. Rivalry made sense, but elaborate decade and a half wars with treaties and maps? Just kind of silly, and not terribly interesting. I only kept reading because I found myself becoming invested in Taylor despite myself. I got entirely caught up in her voice, in her emotions, and in wanting to see things turn out better for her. That, I think, is where this book really shines. And not just when it comes to Taylor herself. The teenage characters in this book all feel so real, and Marchetta put in serious effort in developing them to be so. And so I kept reading, to the point where the plot became bearable, just because I kind of loved these characters in a story that I didn't care about at all.I sometimes complain about a lack of actually present adult role models, and that's rarely more true than it is here. But I generally forgive the book for that, because that very absence is sort of a plot point, instead of a convenient device. Taylor's personality has been molded by her mother abandoning her at a young age, and by not having a true substitute parental figure in her life at all. Hannah is the closest thing she has to an adult who cares for her on a personal level, and she's always kept her at arm's length and vanishes at the beginning of the book. (view spoiler)[Seriously, Hannah, what the hell? I get that Taylor's mother specifically asked her not to be a mother to her, but there's no reason she couldn't have been an aunt. And there's also no reason for her to put the vague wishes of Taylor's absent, drug addicted mother over the very real needs of her young niece. I'm so sad for Taylor that the one person entrusted to care for her still wasn't able to put her first. (hide spoiler)] So yes, while it's a trope that I'm a little sick of, it was used very well here.I do wonder if reading this sooner might have made me feel a little more forgiving towards those first 100 pages. Then again, without the vast reputation this book has, I doubt I would have continued past the first 100 pages. It was worth it, in the end.",7,default,"['contemporary', 'young-adult']"

I was so overwhelmed for hours thinking about what I've just read. Reading the first 200 pages of this book was a slow and almost agonizing process for me. I kept looking at other friends review to reassure myself that this book was worth it in the end. And boy am I glad to have kept reading, oh yes,I am !!There are still one or two things I don't understand about the story. (view spoiler)[How intense was the territorial war? Were the kids ever serious? What exactly are Cadets sand Townies? Are they like kids that are sent to a summer camp or something?  (hide spoiler)] I had a very hard time placing the scene in a certain time line. It seemed ""dystopian"" at first but it mentions Michael Jackson and Harry Potter which made me even more confused. But apparently the Townies, Cadets and the Houses were at ""war"". It just didn't seem like a child's game of tick tack toe. Aside from this major conflict there are questions to be asked about Taylor (the main character) and her past. And the story about Webb, Narine, Fitz, Tate (who I only realized later was used as a woman's name =P) and Jude. (who turned out to be used as a male's name) The story of these five people that didn't fit at all in between chapters. You realize how hard it was, and I'm quite amazed and proud of myself for not quit reading then and there. It was exactly at page 218 when I started to put jigsaw puzzles together. And once that name ""Xavier Webster Schroeder"" was said, I had goosebumps all lover my arms and realized that those 200 pages were well worth it. But there were so many other mysteries to be solved and I wasn't going to stop until I found out every single one of them. And the author's way of slowly revealing them was genius. This book is about I'll-die-if-you-die kind of love, my-whole-life-has-changed-because-of-you kind of love, I'll-go-insane-if-you-leave-me kind of love. But it's also about friendship built on love and trust. Redemption and forgiveness. I'll recommend this book for those who wants to feel.

I dare you to prove me wrong.I'm not kidding though somehow she's done what I started to assume she would do and not only amaze me again but put me in my place as I read through this book.

She's done it again"" and I wonder will she ever cease to amaze me.Special Note: I will go on record stating that the audiobook isn't perfect. I won't say I would avoid it.

I am still stunned. Just as ""Saving Francesca"" and ""Looking for Alibrandi"" by Marchetta, this book has made me cry. But additionally it has made me sit in silent stupor on the sofa afterwards, because even the hopeful and positive ending could not erase the enormous sadness the story instilled in me. It is difficult to explain without giving to much away concerning the mystery of Taylor Markham's past which unravels piece by piece. Taylor is a state ward in an Australian boarding school. She was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at a Seven-Eleven and almost immediately found by a woman named Hannah when she was eleven years old. Before Jellicoe Boarding School Taylor lived with Hannah for a year, who is a counselor at Taylor's dormitory now. As newly elected head of her house Taylor is responsible for the well-being of her house-mates, but also for the traditional territorial wars with the so-called Townies and the Cadets, a bunch of boys from a military school camping in the woods. Taylor's past catches up with her, when she has to negotiate with moody cadet Jonah Griggs. Four years ago she got rather close to him him when she tried to run away to find her mother and he was trying to go back to his family. Taylor still blames him for getting caught, for betraying her. The situation gets even messier, when Hannah suddenly disappears without telling Taylor. Taylor begins to realise how much Hannah means to her and that there might be a connection between the story Hannah has been writing about five kids living on Jellicoe Road twenty years before, Hannah's distance and her own life. The narration alternates between the present told from Taylor's point of view and snippets from Hannah's manuscript. I read and read and felt so sorry for Taylor, for Hannah, for Jonah, for the five friends, for Jessa, the Hermit and other people. Not likely to forget them.

And I don't know :) (haha waaa sorry I'm emotional ^^)This book is about broken people, lost people, people who life has -I'm not going to say mistreated them- but whoa that's a lot of baggage to carry, just saying.But the story is so beautiful that you get yourself into it. And it starts so silly (that territory war really? I was just seriously how could they have drag that thing for 17 years!?) but then it begins to get so serious and intense!This book is about friendship... and you know this saying ""Friends are the family you choose"" or something like that. This people didn't choose each other they found each other, and saved each other. It was just so heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.I wanted to give it 5 stars but they are just some small things that.. Well, the book starts pretty confusing! They are two stories and so many characters and names and stuff going on that you don't get anything, and when you finally start to get it then it gets predictable. This is not entirely bad, it just annoyed me. But everything else was so good that you really don't care for this.One thing I like to say is that I usually don't like books with two or more stories in them because you usually get attached to one of them and the others are just in the middle of the whole thing and you just want to skipped it or read it fast so you get to where you want.

Everything about this book, from the characters to how they relate to each other to the emotions, is intense. I finished reading this a couple of days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. Book hangover alert! This is such a beautiful book about love, friendship and family.

One of her boarding school's house mothers, Hannah, picked her up and watched out for her ever since. When Hannah suddenly disappears without an explanation, Taylor realizes that her past is somewhat tied to Hannah's and she has to uncover mysteries to learn more about herself.I admit that I was lost and confused by the first few chapters of the book. Taylor narrates but interspersed in her story are pages from Hannah's manuscript about the incredible friendship of five kids who used to live in that area. Hannah's story occured more than twenty years ago so basically you're following two story arcs as you read. I think this is also the first time that I've read a novel set in Australia so some of the terms used and the school structure were a bit confusing for me. Just keep reading and by the time you get to the middle, I'm sure you won't be able to stop. Each revelation will make you want to know more. I love the characters in this book - Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz and also the kids in the manuscript: Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude and Fitz. They're all a part of this amazing story. And the sizzling connection between Taylor and Jonah has fed my YA romance hunger. I highly recommend this to fellow YA fans or even those who aren't into YA.

Melina Marchetta is one of those authors. I love how she manipulates words. Sometimes, I still feel like crying myself to sleep over The Piper’s Son and Froi of Exiles only improved on the second reading. On the Jellicoe Road is a different animal. The stories of Taylor Markham, Jonah Griggs, Ben Cassidy, Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude never really came together for me.

Of a character driven story. See what I did there.When I’m reading a character driven novel I need to be able to connect with the secondary characters if not with the—unreliable—narrator. Every fragmented scene was merely an anecdote that had happened to someone else, to people I don’t know or wish to meet. It was all so far, far away from me. I’m not talking about the fact that I live in Northern Europe and the author with her characters lives in Australia, I’m talking about the emotional connection that never was. I did not care. On a technical level I can admire what Marchetta was trying to achieve by indulging in non-linear storytelling and I wish there were more books like this—only better—to challenge readers of all ages. The problem is she’s not good enough author to pull it off. Neither was Hal Duncan, come to think of it, no matter what the award committees might think.

I don't like being sad. A lot of authors feel manipulative when they make me cry - doing bold awful things to their characters. It feels like they're squeezing the tears out. But here I was happy to cry. If I tell you what the books about it sounds silly. Taylor is at boarding school - playing a war game with the kids from town and the cadets from a military school each fall. She's also trying to figure out who she is - literally - not a euphemism. Taylor doesn't know her parents. And it seems like she doesn't even know where to start to get the answers - but it turns out they're right in front of her. So the book is a mystery. And a romance. And a growing-up-and-getting-better story. All of it lightly done - the story has a gauzy nearly ephemeral quality. I read the first ten pages of the book four times. I thought I was missing something. It literally made no damn sense. But I was reading a puzzle - and when you're just looking at the top right corner piece you're not seeing the waterfall. I think this may be the best book I've read this year. It may have usurped those 42 dead Japanese kids. But I'm going to readdress that question in a few days - when this buzz has worn off. Bc - no lie? - I have a book high like you would not believe. I just read a story with so much sadness and so much love that it was magical. Ps - the romance aspect? It was a 6 out of 5 stars.

I live on the Jellicoe Road. There are the Townies who think they own the place, and the Cadets who come once a year. Then there’s the Jellicoe School – a collection of abandoned and troubled teenagers who have all congregated at this bushland boarding academy.And every year, there’s the territory war.For as long as anyone can remember the boarders, cadets and townies battle it out for territory around Jellicoe – from the prayer tree to the club house, bike tracks and river walks. Jellicoe is a puzzle, and whoever gathers the most pieces, wins. This year Taylor Markham has been voted leader of the school. Santangelo is the Townie boss, and Jonah Griggs the Cadet commander. Between the three of them they’ll wage war … but when the battle gets underway, the fight takes a turn none of them saw coming.Taylor and Jonah have a history. They ran away together when they were fourteen years old. Taylor was running to her mother, the one who abandoned her on the Jellicoe road when she was eleven-years-old. And Jonah was just running.When the war gets underway Taylor’s house mentor, her beloved Hannah, leaves unexpectedly with no word of when she’ll return. Taylor travels down to Hannah’s half-finished house everyday, searching for clues… like Hannah’s manuscript. The novel-in-progress tells tale of five Jellicoe children; Narnie, Jude, Tate, Webb and Fitz. The plot is out of order and mired in tragedy, but the more Taylor reads the more she’s convinced that there’s truth to the story. And maybe, just maybe, Hannah’s story will fill the gaps in Taylor’s own memory.First published in 2006, ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is Melina Marchetta’s standing ovation. Winner of the 2009 Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature, ‘Jellicoe’ put Marchetta on the world stage and for many young readers it is the Marchetta book of their generation.‘On the Jellicoe Road’ was a real departure for Ms Marchetta, and as a result the book seems to have a polarizing love/hate effect on audiences. Both ‘Looking for Alibrandi’ and ‘Saving Francesca’, Marchetta’s first two novels, were told in linear. But ‘Jellicoe’ is not that easy. Narrated by Taylor Markham, readers are subjected to her fragmented mind – we are privy to the holes in her memory where something from her childhood is simply too awful to recount, but little pieces come floating out of the ether. Taylor’s memory is jogged by the sudden disappearance of her beloved Hannah, the woman who found her abandoned on the Jellicoe road all those years ago … with Hannah’s disappearance Taylor is forced to link the tragedies of the past with the events in her life today.Aided by Hannah’s unfinished manuscript, Taylor delves into the tales of five Jellicoe teenagers; reading about their antics and friendship, the sadness that bought them all together and the tragedy that tore them apart. The tale of the Jellicoe five becomes the parallel story to Taylor’s, told in fragments as Taylor reads various pages of the manuscript and pieces the plotline together…This, I think, is the biggest hurdle for readers to overcome. The backwards and forwards momentum of the novel and the duel stories, coupled with Taylor’s determined forgetfulness around the events of her childhood … it means that the novel comes to us in drips and drabs, the story leaking out like a dripping tap. But, therein lies the beauty of ‘Jellicoe’. This is a tough novel, to be sure, but it’s also one of Marchetta’s most rewarding and heart wrenching. ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is a novel that stays with you long after you’ve read the last line. Taylor Markham leaves an impression, and if you persevere with the novel (despite lingering doubts) you’ll never regret having met her.‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is especially beloved for having such a wonderful array of characters. From the Townies to Cadets, but especially the Jellicoe School, this is one novel that offers up a smorgasbord of secondary characters. There’s Townie leader, Santangelo, flanked by his Mullet Brothers (also affectionately called Heckle and Jeckle). His father is the resident Jellicoe cop, and Santangelo has a dubious and complicated past with Raffaela (a townie girl who attends the Jellicoe School). Ben and Raffaela are Taylor’s reluctant confidantes, the only two Jellicoe students who don’t immediately doubt Taylor’s capabilities as the new leader in their territory war. Then there’s Jonah Griggs. Josie had bad-boy Jacob Coote, while Francesca pined for strong silent type, Will Trombal … but Jonah Griggs is in a league all his own amongst Marchetta’s men. Taylor first met him at a train platform when they were both fourteen years old and running away, now they are each leading their own factions and fraternizing with the enemy is strictly forbidden. There are rumours about Jonah. Rumours about what he did to his father when he couldn’t take one more beating. Rumours about what he does to those who trespass on Cadet territory. But the most persistent rumours concern him and Taylor … Jonah Griggs will break your heart, only to melt it again. I think he remains Marchetta’s most complex male lead (though Finnikin and Tom Mackee are giving him a run for his money). Jonah is beautiful for his complexities and many shades of grey. He has a violent past that continues to impact him today, but with Taylor he seems to find an inner peace that is born of their intense love. Taylor and Jonah are definitely a stand-out couple, especially for their proof that you can heal after tragedy, but not by yourself. How does Jonah Griggs get to be a ten? He sits on a train with me when we’re fourteen and he weeps, tearing at his hair, bashing his head with the palm of his hand, self-hatred pouring out of him like blood from a gut wound in a war movie, and for the first time in my whole life I have a purpose. I am the holder of the grief and pain and guilt and passion of Jonah Griggs and as we sit huddled on the floor of the carriage, he allows me to hold him, to say, ‘Shhh, Jonah, it wasn’t your fault.’ While his body still shakes from the convulsions, he takes hold of my hand and links my fingers with his and I feel someone else’s pain for the first time that I can remember.As I said, ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is not an easy tale. It’s tough and bitter – Taylor’s past will haunt and anger you, Jonah’s confession will have you choking back tears and the unravelling tale of the Jellicoe Five will leave you a little bit heart-sick. But God, this book is beautiful. Marchetta took a chance and wrote a complex backwards-and-forwards novel, based largely around the memory gaps of one girl’s delicate psyche. She writes about an ages-old territory war, which is intrinsically linked to a town’s history that has seen an abundance of sorrow. This novel is filled with characters you’ll never forget, and two stories that will imprint on your heart and have you re-reading again and again and again. Not an easy read, but then again the best one’s never are. How to describe my adoration for this particular novel, when I love all of Melina Marchetta’s work so very much? Well, it’s probably best summarized by Taylor Markham herself;  I fall in love with these kids over and over again and my heart aches for their tragedies and marvels at their friendship.

I’ve been hearing about this book FOREVER, it seems. Since I’ve read Finnikin of the Rock and loved it, I knew Melina Marchetta’s writing was for me. So I figured this was book would be an excellent choice to start off 2016 right. But omg, I’m caught between holy shit this book nothing is ever going to outshine it this year what a perfect choice and why the fuck did I wait so long to read this Holly you’re such an idiot for putting it off after you got a copy? It did take me a long time to ease into the story. Things were so, so confusing in the beginning, and I had no idea what was happening. And it took a little bit of patience on my end, and more of an effort to keep myself into the story. But once everything started making more sense, and the story was easier to follow along with, I was so hooked on the main character’s voice, and I couldn’t stop reading.Taylor Markham is chosen as the Lachlan’s house leader, reluctantly. She doesn’t seem to care about the wars, or about anything, really. She’s pretty much an orphan, bitter about the world and about her life. Feeling trapped by her past and all of the kids in her House leaning on her for comfort and safety. And when her friend, Hannah, disappears, those feelings of helplessness just increase tenfold. I’ll be honest, Taylor isn’t an easy character to like (and, well, neither is Jonah). She’s cold, pushes people away who just want to make her feel loved and cared for, and she makes decisions without thinking of the consequences or of who’s going to get hurt by it. But underneath that hardened, tough exterior is just a girl who doesn’t know how to let the shadows of her past stop her from moving on. She doesn’t know who she is, and throughout the book, she’s learning right along with you. I loved her story; I loved her character.I loved her strength and her fierceness. I loved that she wanted to be a better person, and that she started trying. I loved that she didn’t let anything stop her from going after the answers she so desperately wanted. And what she finds is, not only her past, but a future worth living for.And in that future lies people she never expected to be in it, least of all Jonah fucking Griggs. This guy. Whoa, boy. He’s not a nice guy. In fact, he’s kind of an asshole who does assholish things and who never apologizes for them. But his actions speak louder than his words, and so, even when he’s being a dick, you can tell there’s a heart underneath that roughness. He just doesn’t really show it, not even to Taylor. But as you learn more about him, you find that perhaps he’s just a kid who’s just sad, who’s hurt and embittered about the world. Perhaps he’s just using that meanness to keep people away, because he doesn’t want to get hurt further than he has been. Perhaps, he even deserves a bit of forgiveness for the way he speaks to others, and to Taylor. Though I feel like we could have gotten to know him better, that he could have been a bit more well-rounded as a character, I think I see the reason why he’s not. Because this wasn’t about him, it was never about him or what he could be to Taylor. The story was Taylor’s story, but one that he wanted to be a part of. She didn’t NEED him to be a better or stronger person, but she had his support and his fumbling attempts to give her the romance she deserves.Melina Marchetta has this subtle way of writing, where she doesn’t outright tell you something, but uses her words in such a way that it has more impact. I don’t even know if that made sense, but omg, just like. She’s a phenomenal storyteller, and the way she unraveled the two colliding stories was utterly brilliant. I’m not sure if I was supposed to be paying close attention to the connections, but I did. And because I did, nothing was a surprise to me. I was able to figure out (almost) everything that had happened in the past, and about how Taylor was connected to the accident that happened 22 years before. But you know what? Knowing didn’t matter. I was still hit with the impact of everything. I was still caught up in the mystery that Taylor is trying to figure out. The question of “where is Hannah” led her on a quest that helped her move on from her past. And man, the manuscript, the story of the five kids whose lives were irrevocably changed on the Jellicoe Road that fateful day, dug deep into my heart. I was just as invested in the past as I was in Taylor’s present. I was not expecting that, nor was I expecting the amount of tears I shed over a book that I never thought would be… inspiring.And I think that had to do with the friendships in this book, the connections between people who you would never expect to become family to one another. Through a tragedy, five lives are forever changed. And over the course of the story, you see how much strength and happiness and peace is gained through the connections the characters have with each other. And that happens with Taylor, also. Not only does she find a relationship with Jonah, one that gives her courage and support, but she finally starts to let other people in. Raffaela, Santangelo, Ben, Hannah. The former two, they become hands to hold as Taylor’s life unravels and she loses sight of who she is. But don’t think that means they’re one-dimensional or anything. Maybe except for Ben, everyone else has their own stories and personalities too, and it makes the book even richer. I especially loved the scenes with Raffy, Santangelo, Jonah, and Taylor. They became their own gang, outside of the wars, and one that gave Taylor a new appreciation for life. Because they stuck by her through everything, even when she tried to push them away. And that kind of friendship, the unshakable kind, is beautiful to behold!This book was expectedly and unexpectedly brilliant. I don’t know how to really express the ways in which this story meant the world to me, but I tried. I hope I did it justice. Jellicoe Road was so much more than what I had thought I would get out of this story when I started it. And I know, I know this book isn’t going to be one that I’ll forget anytime soon. Nor will its characters, who managed to break and heal me in the same moment. It was a stunning, honest, and deeply felt story that captured my heart completely.brb moving to Jellicoe Road.Rating: 5 Paw Prints!",6,default,"['made-me-cry', 'amazingly-wonderful', 'inspirational', 'left-me-speechless', 'i-ship-this-couple', 'feels-feels-everywhere', 'tortured-heroes', 'bff-goodness', 'get-rec-d', 'all-time-favorites']"

My first Melina Marchetta contemporary
Okay first is a lie. Technically ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is my second Marchetta contemporary because I had to read LOOKING FOR ALIBRANDI in high school. Either way, I loved this as much as I loved FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK! I cannot wait to delve into more of Marchetta’s contemporary fiction, or all the other books she’s written really.
Dual storylines
I loved the way this story was told. There are two dual storylines, one from the manuscript and Taylor’s, which overlap a tonne more than I was expecting. So much is inter-related and every single aspect is interesting. I loved the territory wars (it made it so much more entertaining than your usual romance/ family based contemporary) and the depth of the relationships between all the characters.
Super Australian
I’ve never been to boarding school but I’ve been to school my entire life here in Aus, and I can tell you the atmosphere of the Jellicoe school is 100% accurate. Yes, we do have school houses but they’re not as cool as the Hogwarts houses. The lingo in this is also spot on and I really appreciated the use of an Australian narrator for the audiobook!
Taylor’s growth
I’m so proud of Taylor. From a girl who really didn’t want any responsibility in the beginning, she grew so much and became a fantastic leader. I can’t believe how much stuff she’s been through in her past, how much many of the characters have been through in their past honestly. They’re all so precious.
So many emotions
I did not expect to be so ruined by this book but it really does destroy all your emotions multiple times. Even the most minor characters pull at your heart strings. It’s so easy to become incredibly connected to every single character, you really feel for them when bad things happen, and when you learn about their past you just want to tuck them under a blanket and give them a massive hug. They’re all so precious.
In Summary
I’m so glad I’ve finally had the opportunity to read some Marchetta contemporaries. ON THE JELLICOE ROAD was fantastic, so full of feels and emotions, I loved everything about it. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of Marchetta’s stuff. Highly recommended for fans of contemporary novels.",6,default,"['audiobook', 'read-2017', 'own', 'favorites', 'library']"
1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1204945492,1204945492,2015-02-18,5,Eri,/user/show/5509001-eri,"3/20/2015I was rereading this yesterday so I think it's finally time to write a review for it.I thought I had experienced the brilliance of Melina Marchetta's writing when I read Saving Francesca, a stellar novel that reduced me to an aching mess. That was nothing compared to the emotional wreckage that came with reading Jellicoe Road. It is a beautiful novel, well deserving of its high praise, and it is at once a heartbreaking tale but also one that will warm your heart, down to thedark depths of it. It's not the easiest book to get into, especially because the beginning is hard to understand, at least it was for me until the third attempt to start it. But it is well worth that initial struggle. This is the story of Taylor Lily Markham, a girl with no parents. A girl with a past that she doesn't even understand. The story of love, loss, family, and the beautiful power of relationships, all kinds. 
See, I remember love.
 She is a part of a long tradition in her town, the border skirmishes that involve the three parties of the Townies, the Jellicoe School kids, who include herself, and the Cadets. The Cadets who include Jonah Griggs. It isn't a laughing matter, but a serious one that encompasses an old set of rulesand bloodshed. This year, now that Taylor is the leader, things are going to be different. But facing Jonah, who is the leader of the Cadets, is another story altogether. With a shared past, Jonah Briggs is the last person Taylor trusted, before things went horribly wrong. I don't want to give much away but there is a story behind every past, and theirs is the kind that elicits the urge to hug the characters. Or at least, in my case.Jonah Griggs, let's say he and I didn't get off on the right foot. I was unsure ofwhether I was going to love him or not, but I should have had faith. By the halfway point in the book I was utterly in love with this boy. This book isn't quite a romance but the part of the book that was, I wholeheartedly loved, especially the way it unfolded. Beside Taylor are lovable side characters, the other Jellicoe School kids, each with an endearing face that will make you long to be with them. It's impossible not to fall in love with them and the cherish the bond that holds the characters together. In particular, Raffy and Ben are the ones that feature the most and in whatever universe they truly exist, I wish them the best (view spoiler)[*cough* Raffy with Chaz and Ben with Justine is preferable (hide spoiler)].
""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""
And there is the question of Taylor's past, how Hannah, the one adult that Taylor can trust, features in it and so much more. It is truly a journey to travel with her, through the heartbreaking joy and tragedy that follows her.A vital part of this story is about five characters whose intertwining lives are the heart of this story. To divulge anymore would be a crime, but all I can assure you of is that by the time all is revealed I was earnestly sobbing over them. Without them and the fateful incident on Jellicoe Road, this book would have been lost and I am eternally grateful that Melina Marchetta has the mind to write such a beautiful book. 
...who set out on their separate journeys that day not realizing the tragic ironies and joys of that collision of worlds on the Jellicoe Road.
I don't often think this, but if any young adult book should be featured in english classes in high school, it would be this book. It is truly an honor to read this.Read this review hereFirst Read: 2/18/2015I'm currently silently crying because of this book. Some books leave a mark on your heart that will never fade, and I can say with surety that Jellicoe Road is such a book.

Can't re-call if this is my 4th or 5th time reading On the Jellicoe Road, but it is still just as beautiful and moving and leaves me tearing up on the couch, feeling so emotional!I'm pretty sure I will never stop loving this book. It is just the most gorgeous writing and story! Melina Marchetta knows how to crack your heart open and writes the most moving characters!On the Jellicoe Road is a bit of an older YA book now, published in 2006, and is set in rural Australia. It definitely has one of the more bizarre-sounding plots, and I will admit to being a little bit confused the first time I read it because there's a lot of characters and I didn't realize at first that the story was switching between two different points of view, so I'll warn readers about that up front. The main story is told by Taylor Markham, but everything that's italicized is a different point of view.The novel is set at a boarding school called Jellicoe, which is located about 7 hours drive from Sydney, right next to Jellicoe Town. Every year from September to November, a group of cadets come to Jellicoe to practice their outdoor skills and set up camp in the woods for 6 weeks. There are three main factions: the kids boarding at the Jellicoe school, the Cadets, and the Townies, who live and go to school in Jellicoe Town. During the 6 weeks that the Cadets visit every year, the Townies, Cadets, and Jellicoe School have a secret war going on behind the teacher's backs and duke it out to win territory from each other. This year Taylor has been selected as the leader of the Jellicoe School. Taylor has an unfortunate history and was abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road when she was just 11 years old. She was picked up by Hannah, who lives in a small house next to the school and spends the next 5 years attending the school. Taylor knows very little about her past and struggles with the pain she feels about being abandoned by her mother and hesitates to let anyone into her life. She is tested when at the beginning of term, Hannah, the only person who's ever been there for her, disappears. Taylor wants more from the people in her life, but she's afraid to love or let anyone in lest they abandon her too.The only thing Hannah leaves behind for Taylor is an unfinished manuscript about 5 kids and a tragic accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road 22 years earlier. Taylor is confused by the story, but starts developing an attachment to Hannah's characters, wondering if they might have more to do with her past than she realizes. Every single thing about this story is beautiful. The best thing I've always loved about Marchetta's writing is the bonds and relationships she creates between her characters. Marchetta really understands friendships and our need as humans to belong to something. Taylor is slowly falling apart in this novel and I love watching the relationships she builds with the other kids in the story and how they become friends and support each other. I love how each character has this incredible backstory that brings so much depth to the novel. I love that even Marchetta's minor characters are fully realized individuals and that every character matters. There are never throw away characters in Melina's novels.This is ultimately a story about growing up and self discovery. As someone who has been shuffled around, Taylor craves history and I love the history Marchetta creates between each of the characters. Many of them are very broken people and I love watching them grow throughout the novel. Plus, the writing is so dreamy. I think the manuscript is really well written, but I also love Taylor's inner monologue. There are so many great quotes in this book and it hits me right in the feels every time I read it. You do not have to be a teenager to enjoy this book. It actually has some pretty dark and mature themes and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! Please read, it is by far one of my most favourite books of all time!",6,default,"['favorites', 'young-adult']"

It’s impossible to write a review for this book without wanting to cry. No, I didn’t in fact cry after reading this book because it didn’t have a sad ending; however it was a sad book. When I say sad book I am talking about the fact that there is so much going on in this book, so many characters who lose hope and need to find it again, so many reasons to not go on in the lives of the characters. If that doesn’t make you feel depressed I don’t know what will. Do you ever have those days where you just want to drop down and not care about anything? Where you don’t know what the purpose of your life is and you feel so miserable you have no idea what to do? Imagine having to read about characters going through that, if you can relate to it, it’s somehow worse because when we read a book we want AWAY from reality, we don’t want to have to face the reality of our own situation.In the end though, I believe this book is about never giving up that little bit of hope you will always have stored inside you because once you lose it, you are done for.The stories of each individual character is so amazing, there are no flat characters here. It’s so hard to find a book where each and every character has some sort of meaning to them or are connected to the overall plot somehow instead of tid bids here and there. Marchetta though, fits everything together perfectly, like a puzzle; you wouldn’t even know you were reading something that could be of some importance until you read it. Then you would just be surprised because you’d see what a genius Melina Marchetta was.I was a bit vary going into this book, I mean I’d read Finnikin of the Rock and it didn’t necessarily live up to the hype. Plus this book was a sad one. I don’t usually do sad books because hold this kind of power over me that multiplies all the emotions in the book, so if the book is sad, I am going to be depressed, but after reading this, I gave that rule up. I mean I haven’t gone on a “read depressing books” spree but I don’t avoid them anymore.Although the thing about this book is, I would read it again a hundred times despite how sad it made me because it was also one of the best things that ever happened to me. You see seeing I am not the biggest fan of contemporary/realistic to love a book of that genre this much is pretty amazing, but the thing about this one is that it also has that magical aura to it. Like a dream. It’s so beautiful yet heartbreaking. I think I should probably kill myself for not reading it earlier. It’s not a book for everyone, but the ones lucky enough to love it, they will walk away with one of the most beautiful experiences.Right After Reading the BookHoly. Freaking. Crap.My feels. OH MY FEELS!People are always going on about how great Melina Marchetta is. I read Finnikin of the Rock and I liked it.But this book takes her writing to a whole new level.There is so much pain and love in this book. It makes you want to crawl into a corner and cry your heart out.It hurt so much when you realized that (view spoiler)[ Webb is dead, I always liked him from how Taylor described him and how he was in his own story. But I always suspected it would be him.  (hide spoiler)].There aren't enough words in the world to describe how I feel about this book, but one thing is for sure, it redefines how I will rate my books in the future.This book shouldn't get a 5.

What a gorgeously written, emotionally exhausting, brilliantly constructed and effortlessly executed piece of art this book is! I can't tell you much about this book without spoiling, but it's honestly something that everyone needs to experience themselves. Yes, the rumors are true: it takes quite a while to understand things but when you understand you're in it for the long haul! I knew that this ""not understanding"" part could be an issue, but I just tried to go with the flow and enjoy it as much as possible until the turning point. This book does NOT disappoint, let me tell you!
“A home to come back to every day of their lives.Where they would all belong or long to be.A place on the Jellicoe Road.”
This is foremost a book about characters AND THEY ARE ALL SO AMAZING! Quite frankly idk who I love more, because they're all so squishy and lovable and broken but you can't help but root for them and then you want them to all have the world and oh god I'm getting extra, aren't I? Alright. Um. Um. Ummmmmmm even though the book is mostly character-driven, plot doesn't lack one bit. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and there are so many twists and turns and there are OMFG kind of happenings and everything. There is quite a bit of fooling around (in every possible sense of this term) and I loved following all of these dorks during the Territory wars. The book itself has two narratives. One where our MC Taylor leads us through the ""now part"" and one another set of characters. But really! I can't tell you anything more, because oopsy daisy! I wouldn't want to spoil youuuu. So is it finally proper time to speak about my feels since I can't talk about anything else?OK SO THE SHIPS??? I AM BROKEN IN PIECES BUT PUT TOGETHER ALL THE SAME. THIS BOOK IS SO AMAZING ON THE ROMANCE FRONT BUT DON'T LET MY SCREAMING FOOL YOU; JELLICOE IS PAIN! I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I CRIED SO MUCH WHEN IT WASN'T A KRISTA AND BECCA BOOK? MAYBE DURING FIXING DELILAH?? ANYHOW, THIS BOOK BROKE ME IN A THOUSAND TINY PIECES AND AFTER THE BOOK WAS DONE I WAS A SOBBING MESS. I TEXTED KATIE AND ERI THAT I COULDN'T STOP CRYING AND I JUST CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED. THIS WHOLE BOOK IS SO EMOTIONAL [and quite honestly a tad bit fucked up] AND I'M GETTING SO EMO JUST THINKING ABOUT IT ;___________; THIS BOOK IS MAGIC AND YOU SHOULD ALL READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. YOU. ARE. MISSING. OUT. KKKK.This is the place where I apologize and bow down to Tanja and Rashika who have been pestering me for years to read this book. I was stubborn and resisted, because most of Aussie writers' books I've read haven't suited me that much. The books I've read all have this distinct style of writing where words and scenes are cropped and rushed. While Marchetta does have that in her prose, it's very minimal and I never really turn much attention to it, because her books do what very few books are able to: these books suck you in and consume my mind, heart and soul.

Happy 104th read for the year! I loved this just as much the second time around - if not just a little bit more because I didn't have the initial confusion that I had last time and this time around I loved Jude and Jonah from page #1. Magical.Original ReviewOk. Ms Marchetta has totally broken me with this book. There is a reason why this woman is my fave author of all time. Every book she writes just pierces my heart and takes me weeks to recover from emotionally and this book is no different. I went to hear her speak recently and I brought in my entire stash of books to get signed and I am so delighted that I got her to sign this book for me.... With all honesty though, for the first 150 pages of this I was convinced this was a 2 star read and I felt gutted that I had finally read a book by her that I didn't love. I had NO idea what was going on and it is the biggest criticism of this book when you read the reviews (with lots of DNFs attached to it). The story switches between two time periods and for the first third of the book you have no idea who is who and what the three groups (cadets/townies/Jellicoe School kids) are. Actually at the end of the book I am still confused about the five houses - was it a boarding school or an orphanage or something else? I do wish that the three groups were a bit more clearly explained and although part of me realistically wanted to give a lower rating for making me work so hard to get into this story - I just can't as I love this book. I hit page 178 where Jonah makes a reveal (view spoiler)[ ""I wasn't there that day to get on the three forty-seven to Yass,"" he says. ""I was there to throw myself in front of it""  (hide spoiler)] and I just lost it. I totally adore Jonah (what a beautifully broken soul). I love Hannah. I love Jude (and boy does Jude and Hannah remind me of Captain and Beatrice from Finnikin). I love how about half way through the book the two time periods come together and the ""war"" takes on a whole new meaning.I also love when a book with a mystery makes me fall for the red herrings (clever!). I was so convinced that (view spoiler)[ Taylor was the daughter of Hannah and Jude and that she had been kidnapped by Tate. Nope...  (hide spoiler)]. Although I did guess the other mystery surrounding Webb :-(. Oh that again broke my heart into a million pieces. The dialogue is perfect. This is one of the most beautiful books I have read - such friendship and such tragedy, such broken characters - but yet such a story of hope and optimism in the end.

I want to CRY. I just wrote the longest review that got wiped out. Urgh.Alright, I try again, but more concisely.Jia at Dear Author recommended this book: ""I have a bone to pick with you. I’ve got a packed read-and-review schedule for the next month or so, and I need to be able to move from book to book. But you’ve made that impossible. Yes, I blame you. It’s your fault that your book, Jellicoe Road, left me so drained and dazed that I can’t read anything else.""http://dearauthor.com/wordpress/2009/...That statement right there convinced me that I had to read Jellicoe Road. I LOVE that feeling. That feeling I get when I've read something SOOO consuming that I can't move on. I walk around for days in a daze recalling the story and just wanting to be back in that world. So, I knew I had to read Jellicoe Road. I put it on my wish list and then didn't read it until now because many people's reviews have described it as ""slow start"" or ""difficult to understand"" so I began to look at Jellicoe Road as something that would be a chore, but worth it.It wasn't a chore to read at all. I was hooked from the first few pages. The writing is haunting, emotional, and just simply beautiful.Jia also wrote: ""In fact, “enjoyment” seems like too mild a word. After its slow start, the book gathered more and more momentum, until I was completely swept away from thoughts of my own life. I became so invested in Taylor and the other characters in the book that some sections seemed heartbreaking to read, albeit in a cathartic and healing way. I laughed and cried — or, as my husband put it, “blubbered.” When I finished this book, my tear ducts felt completely empty.""This is the story of Taylor Markham. A 17 yo student at the Jellicoe School. A private/state school in rural Australia. When she was 10, Taylor was abandoned at a 7 Eleven by her mother in a nearby town, and has lived at Jellicoe School ever since then. This is also the story of five kids that attended Jellicoe School (or 3 attended Jellicoe school, one was a cadet, and one a Townie) in the generation preceeding Taylor's. Their story is slowly revealed, as their relationship to Taylor is revealed. Jellicoe School students engage in territory warfare with the local kids and a troop of cadets that camp nearby for 8 weeks every year. At the beginning of the story, Taylor is instated as the leader of the Jellicoe kids so she must engage in negotiations and strategy at a time of great confusion for her as she slowly unravels the mysteries of the past. The woman at Jellicoe School whom she has become the closest to has disappeared with no word to her. Taylor is left feeling betrayed, confused and mentally unbalanced.This story is HEARTWRENCHING and absorbing. I loved it. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars (due to my complete love of the characters) is some frustration I have with almost every adult in this book.I don't like their secrets. They are unnecessary and cruel. I also don't like that they all supposedly love Taylor SO MUCH, yet Taylor has NO ONE for the majority of her life. I hate that with a white hot passion. So I docked a star, despite that I strongly suspect the Jellicoe Road will hold a special place in my heart for years to come. ",6,default,[]

It should be recommended to all people who want to nurture their soul. In the past four years I’ve come across a plethora of books that didn’t leave an impression. A positive one.This is why when I stumbled upon this blurb and I read Emily May’s review, I knew I had to have it.I turned the last page twelve hours ago and I haven’t stopped thinking about it ever since. After one year and a half of mediocre novels, discovering this one was like coming up for fresh air. Well-crafted, well-thought, perfectly balanced.    The head nerd of the Cadets is my partner and when it’s over he asks me for my number. I say no. “It’s because they don’t have coverage out here,” Griggs tells him.“No,” I say, looking up at Griggs. “It’s actually because my heart belongs to someone else.” And if I could bottle the look on his face, I’d keep it by my bedside for the rest of my life.  I can’t give away too many details, because when it comes to this book and these characters tiptoeing around the plot (and its sub-plot) is the best I can give you. What did Jellycole Road remind me of? Another YA. We were liars. Where the line between reality and dream was so thin, I couldn’t discern what was happening and what was not.Dream. Such a weak and solitary word if we think about it. But for Taylor, the main character, a dream held so much power over her, she kept chasing it over and over again. A dream was the culprit of her parting ways with Jonah, years prior. A dream was where she had named herself.   “Go to hell,” he said, but there was a desolate fear in his eyes and I couldn’t look away. “Been there. Trust me. It’s so overrated.”  I liked every single character. Every.single.one. Raffy with her sentimental, but firm attitude, Santangelo with his stoic voice, Ben the violinist turned advisor and Jonah. He blew me away like no other YA male character ever had.    ""Jonah Griggs standing, watching me. Like he did on that station platform. Like he did those times we lay side by side on our way to Yass. Staring like he’s never stopped. For a moment the mask slips from his face, but by that time I’m almost out the door.""  This author, made me feel. So much. It’s a novel that makes you think. It’s a book that leaves you guessing. It’s a book that makes you question the outcome and perhaps a little bit of your own sanity.It’s the first five stars rating I’ve given after reading All the ugly and wonderful things one year and a half ago.Go in blind, go in with your heart and your open-mind.

There are no words to describe this. What do you want me to say? That her writing made me weep because it's so beautiful? That it's so vivid, it feels like I'm watching the story from the sidelines? That it's so engrossing I'd yell like a banshee at anyone who tried to talk to me? That her whole idea of the book is sheer brilliance? That I wish I could be part of their world? Be a part of the territory wars? To be super close with Taylor and Raffy and the rest of them? Because this book is all those things, and so much more. There is incredible character development-Taylor's development. At the beginning, she's a devil-may-care, don't-give-a-shit-about-shit angry girl, whom, in different circumstances, I would've detested. On the contrary, I loved her from the get-go. She possesses spunk, brilliance, personality and charm. Later on, as the story progresses, we see the kindness in her, the love and respect she has for everyone and the faith, without losing her other admirable attributes. She is awesome, amazing; absolutely unforgettable. In fact, all the characters of this novel are unforgettable: Raffy, Ben, Jude, Hannah, Webb, Tate, Fitz, Chaz, Jessa, Chloe P., the Mullet brothers, Jonah, dear God, even Richard. They all have their distinctive, wonderful personalities. They all fit in the story without taking space. They are one of the best supporting characters I have ever had the fortune to read of. To meet. To remember. Moreover, the romantic parts of On the Jellicoe Road don't take over the whole story. The story's about Taylor finding herself, her past and present. Although the romantic bits are kept to a minimum, they're far better and far more swoon-worthy than a book that is all about romance. That Jonah Griggs, he makes my heart skip multiple beats, and I'm sure them aliens can hear the butterflies fluttering wildly in my tummy and my heart pounding when it isn't skipping multiple beats. Furthermore, it made me cry, this book. Because of the sadness of it all, the beauty of it all; the desire for it to not end, not just yet. A little bit longer, please, because I don't want to part with this book, this brilliance. The only disappointment I have is that I guessed everything a few chapters into the story. But that's probably due to watching a lot of crime shows. Or maybe I'm a crazy genius. I think it's the latter. This is my first Melina Marchetta book, but it most certainly won't be the last. If all her books leave me speechless like this, then I will gobble them all up like gummy bears till the end of time.

(along with picture quotes that I made).This is a book that's been sitting on my shelf for almost three years. Not kidding. I bought it awhile ago, not having a clue who this author was, or even knowing anything about the story, and thought I'd give it a try. I made it maybe a few chapters and felt completely lost and gave up. Who is this lady? And who told her she could write? I thought it was totally confusing and I should not waste another minute attempting to decipher it. Back on the shelf it went.Fast forward a year and I decide to give this author another try with Saving Francesca and then with The Piper's Son. Woah. Now I was completely aware of who she was, and immensely blown away by her writing. Everyone kept telling me I needed to read Jellicoe Road, that it's amazing. But I was also warned it's a book that takes awhile to push through. You have to give it time to marinate into your bones, simmer awhile inside your soul, but keep pushing through. I kept adding this book to my bookish resolutions, TWICE, to read it that year. But this fear kept creeping inside me, pushing it further back on the shelf.Well, folks. It's finally happened. I feel like I've just conquered a huge reading milestone in my life.I've read Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta.And what a beautiful, majestic, breathtakingly heart ache of a story it is.So what's the story about, you may be asking. I know I questioned this myself before I read the book, and never got a true answer. Something about a group of kids, on the Jellicoe Road, a tree, and a Jonah Griggs. But WHAT IS IT ABOUT?? I honestly don't think I can give the answers to that either. It's a book you have to experience for yourself, and quite possibly go into it blindfolded. Just know that it's a story so rich and pure with a plot that twists and turns, cultivating into the most beautiful ending your literary heart may ever experience.Shut out your fears, jump off that fence, and read this book right now. There is never going to be the ""right time"". NOW is the right time. Trust me when I say this, you're missing out on something extraordinary without knowing the beauty of this story. Melina Marchetta already chiseled out a place inside my heart with the previous two novels I read by her, but now she's solidified a spot in my top honors of writers who can never be topped, no matter what.I am so happy to have finally found my place among these Jellicoe Fans.

I have titled her as the Queen of Feels and Destruction. I know my rating for this book suggests otherwise, I did enjoy this book. It was my least favorite out of all the books I have read by her, though. Let me explain.First of all, I did not understand Taylor Markham. Reading her narrations felt like I needed her to explain more about how she felt towards her problems. There was a lack of a voice in her. With Marchetta's other female characters, I understood their frustration or their anger towards something, but with Taylor I felt like she was a brick wall. I didn't like her at times because she acted like such a stone cold bitch with her friends and Jonah. I just could not relate to her. And a lack of personality in her also did not help. I also did not enjoy the interweaving plots with Taylor's story and Hannah's. Not only was I utterly confused (because I am a very slow human being), I was just aggravated at the times where I needed to read Hannah's manuscript about the five kids on the Jellicoe Road. I skipped those parts, to be honest. I was just not interested, and that may have completely destroyed my understanding of the book, but oh well... I just did not have the patience to jump back and forth from past to the present.Lastly, the pacing was a bit off at times. Sometimes the book went slowly and then it soared. What I did enjoy about the book were the characters. Jonah, Chaz, and Raffy were such sweethearts. They were great friends to Taylor! I loved their backgrounds and I did not feel as though Marchetta left any of them out when it came to character development. I appreciated that. I also enjoyed the beautiful writing, though that is not a surprise when it comes to Marchetta. Her writing is perfection. Overall, I could not handle the feels at many parts of this book. Hell, I cried reading the prologue, and the story didn't even start at that time. I realized. Do you guys ever categorize authors when you pick up their books multiple times?

Maybe I will have to give it another shot sometime. As it was I mostly found myself bored and impatient with it, a bit. I found myself skimming forward quite a bit, just wanting to know what was going on so that I'd be finished. The book moves back and forth between Hannah, our protagonist, and the five other people that the book is about, and honestly, it just... didn't grab me? I don't know. After this and We Were Liars I've come to realize that it takes a very skilled book to grab me and slowly reveal something without me getting so impatient that it completely spoils my enjoyment of it. Added to that is the fact that honestly, Hannah is incredibly unlikable. She's definitely been through some shit, but there's only so far that my patience will extend with dealing with that if I don't empathise with the character. Somehow that was lacking for me, here. I mostly wanted to shake her and tell her to get over herself, honestly. The way that she treats others, the way that she lashes out... I hated it, and mostly found myself sympathizing with other people over her. I was similarly impatient with one of the other characters in the book, Griggs - for him to be as compelling as the author clearly wanted him to be, the arrogance and the attitude would have had to be toned down a bit. So yes, between the plot that didn't grab me and the characters that irritated me, not entirely what I was expecting from this book, and a little disappointing. Maybe a reread someday in the future will make this book gel for me in a different way.",6,default,"['read-in-2016', 'disappointing', 'needs-more', 'blah']"

Yet, there were enjoyable parts, and it never got too serious or depressing for me. I would highly recommend this for those looking for an emotionally hard-hitting older YA book. There were a ton of emotions going on for me while I read, which seemed to arise pretty naturally from the story, without much manipulation from the author (although I thought a few plot points were somewhat emotionally excessive and gratuitous, but I'll forgive the book for that). The characters and character development were very well done. I loved Jonah, and Taylor rang true for me as a portrayal of a teenager who had grown up in very difficult circumstances and then been abandoned as a child. I really felt for most of the characters. What I loved most was how the characters frequently acted like real people, not perfect facsimiles. This made the relationships between the characters rocky at time, but much more touching.I do, however, have some criticisms. First, I just didn't ""get"" the territory wars in which the three groups of teenagers participated. The war didn't sound fun for the most part to me, in fact quite the opposite, so I don't understand why they would keep competing/fighting with each other. Did they really have absolutely nothing better to do with their time? Plus, where was the adult supervision? But ultimately, this issue of mine didn't really end up mattering. Secondly, I did find a number of things somewhat predictable.An excellent book overall and one that I anticipate will stay with me for a long time.",6,default,"['read-ya', 'reviewed', 'read-novels', 'gladiator-games']"

I'm usually not one to get caught up in unraveling a mystery, especially in the form of flashbacks, but the way the timeline played out was so cleverly done that you couldn't help but fall in love with the secondary set of past characters who are introduced throughout the book.

I don't know that I've ever connected with a teen heroine so much in my life as her. You can feel every last bit of her pain and confusion and growth. And don't get me started on Griggs, her love interest. An instant, lifelong OTP was made here today. There's not of that cliche YA nonsense happening here.

It's only appropriate, really, for the beginning to confuse us, since Taylor is sort of lost herself. Since she is telling us the story as she struggles with her role at school, her missing mother, the disappearance of a favorite adult, and needy peers, we see her frustrated state of mind. There are intriguing hints of a story that took place a generation before, and slowly the two stories connect. The ending is an unexpectedly forceful tearjerker, with happy and painful moments crushed together. At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start. There's some violence - car accidents, fights, a suicide, hints of child abuse - that are more emotionally intense than graphic, as are the brief sex scenes. Updated: she's won the Printz!

The word 'enigmatic' is used in the blurb above and I couldn't think of a more perfect way to sum up this novel. Marchetta leaves clues beginning right from the very first page and by the end of the book you'll be slapping your forehead in disbelief you didn't pick up obvious - yet crucial - elements. The story starts off at a slow pace as the reader tries to figure out what the deal is with the territory wars and just what kind of background each character has come from. However, Marchetta eases the readers into each of the lives on Jellico road and has them wanting exactly what Taylor Markham wants - more. The book comes together like a beautiful puzzle and has Marchetta's trademark stamped all over it - characters that feel so real they could be your best friends.

It’s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that’s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It’s not the pain they’re getting over, it’s the love.
I really liked it but being honest, I was expecting to be wowed about it just because it is the most infamous and best rated Melina’s book, excepting Lumatere’s sequels. I have really enjoyed the reading. The story, the characters, the pace are good as you could expect from Melina but I found the writing in her Lumatere’s Chronicles superlative and remember Saving Francesca more captivating, even though the later is a simpler story. Still loving Merchetta, though, 
because I do love the second half
.”I think back to my dream of the boy, because in it I find solace. I like that word. I’m going to make it my word of the year. There is something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong. Belong. Long to be.I would have liked it much more if Melina had enlightened me at least about the generation of the characters earlier in the book. There were a lot of moments during the first half where I didn’t have a clue about who was who in Hanna’s book or at the territorial wars, how old they were, if they were contemporaneous or whether they were related to each other or not. Part of reason why was the mystery needed to be solved (the boy of the tree in her dreams) but another part could have been easily fixed with just a few clarifications. I might have missed the hints even if they were there for me, but I know that I’m not the only one out there being so confused and therefore fearing through almost all the first half to be put out of the story -That didn’t really happened because I enjoy trying to get my bearings in this kind of books-. I don’t think I’m spoilering anyone with some clarifications. The book is told from Taylor Markham’s -a Jellicoe Road student- point of view. Somehow her thirtysomething tutor’s past in her teenage years –at that time she was known as Narnie, but her actual name is Hannah- will has repercussions on Taylor’s life. We get Hannah’s POV in third person via a book written by her. Jellicoe Road and its summertime territorial wars against Cadets and Townies were first fought by Hannah and her friends twenty years ago, but the teens war still takes place each summer until now and those are a few of the many connecting links of both characters and stories.”We’ve lost a substantial amount of territory. It’s been split up between the Cadets and Townies.”Love the characters. All of them, but I specially loved Griggs, Webb, Ben, Santangelo and Jude in this story (warning, I’m mixing two different timelines here ;P. Don’t get lost, teehee). I know, I have mentioned almost all the male characters. Melina makes up amazing male characters, all age included!The territorial wars were also fun – they brought me back sweet memories from my childhood when I read The War of the Buttons, one of the few books my father recommended to me when I was little – … and Richard booms, “No prisoners! No prisoners! – which is ridiculous, because it’s not as if we’re going to kill them, but he has this Lawrence of Arabia obsession…” Loved the (arch-enemies’s) friendship. Love grown-ups and teens relationships. (view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier’s: ”Suddenly, I’m somewhere else, in another time. On the shoulders of a giant. I had wanted to be my father’s shoulders an all this time they were Jude’s. But he holds on to me in a way that Hannah never has. I feel his relief, like he hasn’t held someone in a long, long time. And he’s wanted to. (hide spoiler)]Loved all the love stories. They are small but so deep felt! Melina, you do write amazingly about feelings.(view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier’s…: He had never heard emotion from Narnie before and now… now it was so loud, so gut-wrenching that he wanted to cover his mouth with his hand. but Taylor and Jonah’s was so beautiful too! (hide spoiler)]In the end it was not the big tearjerker I was fearing of (and I’m happy that it wasn’t) so if that’s what was holding you back, that cannot be a deterrent for you either, really. As I say, you don’t really need to be looking for signs of incoming tragedy as I did. Heartbreaking past tragedies are there to overshadow Taylor Markham’s, Jonah Griggs’s (and Hanna’s) present -as it happened in Lumatere’s and Charyn’s kingdoms- but thanks to Melina I could handle all the sad events that took place in the Jellicoe Road in both timelines. (view spoiler)[Okay. I did cry a little at the last “Look at my beautiful girl” scene... but I would have thrown the kindle if Griggs had died in that damned tunnel! (hide spoiler)]Had you already had Jellicoe Road under your radar? You should read it. I think is a great read for everybody, no matter the age. Recommended to lovers of How to kill a Mockingbird, The Diary of Anne Frank and The War of the Buttons.I fall in love with this kids over and over again and my heart aches from their tragedies and marvels at their friendship.",5,default,[]

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen.”- Jellicoe Road, PrologueAnd so begins Jellicoe Road, one of the most frustrating but rewarding books i have ever read. Jellicoe Road contains many stories; the book weaves together past and present, family and mysteries, loyalty and friendship, and at times it is heartbreakingly sad.Taylor Markham has lived at a boarding school ever since she was abandoned by her mother many years ago. The story is hard to explain; one narrative takes place in the present, with Taylor trying to figure out where her closest friend and guardian, Hannah, has disappeared to.The second story is set in the past and follows four friends. The prologue is part of this second story.The flashbacks were a breath of fresh air and the way they tie in to the present-day story is simply amazing. I had figured out the twists behind When You Reach Me because I had heard there were secrets lurking in the story; I didn’t think that Jellicoe Road would have any plot twists, but when they were revealed not only was it shocking; it felt right. Not like “What the heck was the author thinking?” but “Ahhh, it makes sense.” Just what you want in this little puzzle of a book.I could barely read this book when I first started it. Actually, that’s not totally true; the introduction is simply amazing. I read the first few pages and thought that the rest of the book would be just as gripping- but instead, the plot became incredibly convoluted and confusing.The story springs right into Taylor’s life without any exposition whatsoever. Usually I love these types of stories; figuring out what’s happening is usually fun. But in this book, I was just frustrated.I couldn’t seem to care about the characters; the back story to the plot was either to brief or vague; some plot elements made absolutely no sense until the very end. I found Taylor to be an unsympathetic lead; she seemed so caught up in her teenage angst.Reading it began to feel like a tiresome trip; I tried to encourage myself to stay with it (it won the Printz award! That prologue was breathtaking!) but I eventually just gave up and put it down for a while. After wondering if the plot actually got anywhere, I picked it up again to read the ending (it’s a bad habit).And I decided to give it another try. And I was completely blown away. I couldn’t put it down; I cried like i had just read the ending of The Book Thief for the first time (well, almost).Thing is, it didn’t get that good until i was 3/4 through the book. Once I was about to read the final chapter, I actually decided to read the entire book from the beginning again to see what I had missed; it made the epilogue all the more powerful. Reading it the second time through, it almost seemed like another book. There are a whole bunch of little details that you miss the first time (mostly because what the heck is going on?!?!) but you can take the time to get to know the characters the second time through. And the characters, I find, are one of the most important elements of a novel.Final Verdict: An amazing book. The way the Marchetta ties together the past and present is nothing short of genius. The frustrating confusion at the beginning drags the book down but it’s all worth it for the ending. ---Apparently I read and reviewed this book when I was around thirteen. Every time I re-read Jellicoe it never loses its power; although I've fallen harder for Melina Marchetta's characters in other books since then (and she's easily become my favorite author), I still marvel at how everything falls into place so skillfully here. If I had to pick one novel that really stands out in being a gateway to the stories that shaped my high school years, this would be it.",5,default,"['all-time-favorites', 'i-cried', 'gorgeous-writing', 'surprisingly-good', 'best-characters', 'contemporary', 're-reading', 'oh-my-god-that-ending', 'highly-recommended']"

I started thinking about how to kick this off when I reached the halfway point in the book yesterday. I thought about starting with some kind of song. Some lyrics. Coldplay kept popping into my mind, but then I abandoned the idea and moved on. Hence, the beginning of this review is just me telling you about how I don’t know how to begin.When I don’t give a pretty great or well-loved book five stars, I like to explain why it lost that one star before I talk about how it earned the four. So I’ll start there, and even in my criticisms, I promise to be respectful of this novel and I hope I never sound as though I didn’t really love it. Because oh, how I loved it. Please don’t think me over-sensitive. There are a few things that sometimes really bug me in a book. The F-word. I don’t think it needed to be used so often. Of course I never think it’s necessary to use it at all, but I can deal with it being in there several times. But this seemed like a lot to me. I know everyone has a different conception of a lot. I just would have liked this so much better if there hadn’t been so many F-bombs. Maybe it adds realism or something for some people, but I just don’t think the F-word does anything for a story but take away from it. I’ve never said that word, I don’t much like to hear it in my head. That being said, I’d like to say that the “love scenes” were handled very well, being pretty vague. Less is more, people, less is more. I didn’t feel like my brain was being infiltrated with filth and I didn’t have to skip pages. Yay, Marchetta! If this hadn't been handled the way it was, it would have ended up being a complaint. But it's not. I applaud the author for this.And oh my goodness, these characters are wonderful. All of them. From Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, and Jude. To Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz, and even Ben. Notice that in both cases it’s a group with 3 boys and 2 girls? Ben is sort of left out sometimes, but I’m finding that rather interesting, even though it hasn’t got much bearing on the story at all. xD Can I just say right now that I love Jonah Griggs? Okay. I love him. I also love how the two different stories are interwoven. This is literary genius. It’s like a mystery but not a mystery at all. It was fun to pick apart the two stories and figure out how they fit together. It really kept me interested even through the slow parts. (view spoiler)[But I’m such a dunce that I didn’t figure out the thing about Fitz accidentally shooting Webb until the last chapter. Yeah, I am blushing about my stupidity. (hide spoiler)] Basically, I’ve go to say, this book starts out really strangely. I was totally confused through the first few chapters. But then it starts to make sense, and it just gets better the more we figure out what’s going on. If you stick with it through the odd beginning, you’ll be glad you did. Finally, I’d like to touch on what this book is, at its heart, about. It’s about grief and hurt and it’s about forgiveness. It’s about getting through the toughest times and learning to trust and love. It’s about learning to let people in.I know someday I'll read this again. I don't know how soon that day will be, but I know I'll travel down Jellicoe Road again eventually. It was a worthwhile journey. I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand.""

I am always skeptical when a book gets an overwhelming amount of rave reviews because I have been sorely disappointed too many times. No disappointment this time. JELLICOE ROAD deserves every five star review it has gotten. It took me on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and I was sad to see it end. Taylor Markham attends a boarding school in rural Australia. She has been chosen as the student leader of her house and appointed by the graduating class to lead the school in their territory war against the Cadets and the Townies. As you can imagine, the Cadets are a military school and the Townies are the local school kids. Chaz Santangelo leads the Townies and Jonah Griggs, with whom Taylor has a mysterious past, leads the Cadets. As the territory wars heat up, Taylor’s house leader and ersatz mother, Hannah, disappears. Left with only Hannah’s unfinished memoir as a clue, Taylor teams up with Jonah to find Hannah. Their search leads Taylor to Sydney and ultimately to self-discovery. Have your tissues handy! I guarantee you will cry at least one tear when reading JELLICOE ROAD. My heart broke when I read this book, but ultimately the message was one of hope and redemption. Although it was sad and dark at times, I found it refreshing to read a YA novel that was where good things don’t just drop out of the air for the heroine. Real life isn’t like that, and boy does Taylor Markham know it. I had absolutely no idea what was going on for the first few chapters of the book. For a while I thought I was reading a dystopian novel or something. Then the fog started clear and things actually started to make sense; from then on, I was engrossed. After finishing the novel, I decided I liked how confusing everything was in the beginning. It’s a lot like Taylor herself: she didn’t really know who she was, who her family was, or why she was at the Jellicoe School. Taylor’s journey of self-discovery was paced equally with my own discovery of what the heck was happening. Ingenious! Loved that little element. Part of my confusion was about Taylor and Jonah’s past. What happened to them? How did the y meet? Who was The Hermit? What did Jonah do to his father? The details about their shared past were slowly revealed. By the time I had the entire picture of how they met and their past mistakes, I was rooting for both of them and for their budding romance. The carefully doled-out details of their history really added depth both to their character development and to their relationship development. Although I was skeptical of all the gushing reviews for JELLICOE ROAD, I am so glad I picked it up and read it. It was so very different from the YA novels I usually read and I loved JELLICOE ROAD all the more for it.",5,default,['boarding-school']

This book left me speechless.What do you want me to say? What could I possible say? It was so overpowering and magnificent that left me with no words. Seriously, I have never read a contemporary book so, so good! Melina Marchetta is beyond my understanding. First, I idolized her for the only book I read of hers, Finnikin of the Rock. Now, she absolutely left me speechless. Jellicoe Road is something else, something indescribable, something capable to marvel any reader around the world. It doesn't matter the genres you prefer nor your age or your cultural background because Jellicoe Road is capable to reach the most inner core of human being, the soul.How can so much sadness and love belong -long to be- to the same place? I wonder... how is that possible? in this book it is. Two stories masterfully intertwine on the Jellicoe Road, linking the past and the present, the characters and their stories. This book is a Road full of enriching, humane and soul-touching life experiences about self-discovery, belonging, understanding and forgiveness. This book is certainly a Road you'll want to walk by yourself and absorb everything it has to offer.I am so ashamed to say that I waited so long to read this book, but I am also proud to say that now I have this book on my shelf. I knew Jellicoe Road would amaze me, Finnikin of the Rock which is also by Melina Marchetta, highly did and I was ready to read something absolutely great in this book. However, what I did not expect was that Jellicoe Road would touch every single cell of my body with such strength that even my soul would be overpowered. The intensity of this book will absorb readers's souls and wont let them go until they shed the last tear. After that, it will be the readers that wont let go of this book.Melina Marchetta must be a writer sent by God or something, because I doubt I'll ever read something like this ever again. For me, she excels among any YA writer and Jellicoe Road is the physical proof of it. The lyrical and emotionally evocative writing style will steal your breathe countless of times. The characters, the plot and the countless themes in this story, makes this book a must-read and a must-have. I don't know what else I can say to express how I feel about this book. How can I let readers know that they should pick Jellicoe Road and read it not only once but twice, and then a third time and a fourth... Seriously, this is a book to re-read. I certainly want to walk over and over again on the Jellicoe Road.Jellicoe Road is a story that has certainly engraved itself into readers' heart and memory and it will certainly engrave its own mark through history. Now, if you haven't read this book yet, go and get it as soon as you can and turn to the first page... That is your first step to walk ""the prettiest road I'd ever seen"" (p.1) Now go and walk this inspirational, meaningful and overwhelming story on the Jellicoe Road.",5,default,"['young-adult', 'favorites', 'best-ya']"

Just like the rating scale, I feel the adjectives are limited and would not convey my truest feeling I have for this book. Ugh, this is so frustrating. If anything, this book merits recognition from the entire human population if not the universe as a whole. There, that should count for something, right?You know, if I had ever doubted Marchetta’s writing competency in the past, that feeling was now completely eradicated and I have this book to thank for that. I’m not implying she doesn’t write well because she does write well. The point is On the Jellicoe Road is so adeptly written, you’ll be reminded the reasons you worship Marchetta. This book particularly is the greatest reminder of all.On the Jellicoe Road is an engulfing read. I won’t lie to you and say that you’ll dote on the book right from the very first page because you won’t, though I have no doubt the lyrical prose will immediately pull you in. Truth be told, I was disoriented for about 100++ pages or so because I felt everything was all over the place and didn’t seem to follow the conventional storytelling. In other words, it was like reading the story from backward. But do not be disheartened by it, my fellow comrades. The unconventional storytelling is exactly what On the Jellicoe Road needsto make it an outstanding reading. As the story progresses, the plot is revealed bits by bits and when you’ve finally caught on with what’s happening, I swear to God, you’ll be so consumed in the story you’ll forget everything else that doesn’t have to do with the book. You’ll forgive Marchetta for making things so confusing in the beginning because the story as a whole is so worth the damn twisty route. I am already missing the book as we speak. This is one of the books that I wouldn't mind if it went on forever. In fact, I demand for it. I don’t know how to do this book justice, my words won’t cover even an inch of that, so I think the best way to do it is to encourage for you to read it for yourself. Except I won’t encourage. That's too mild. I will bug you until you all have given in. But seriously, give it a go.  Recommended! P.s.: Psst! Just between you and me, I think Marchetta made a pact with the Devil because this book (and all of her other books I've read) are to die for, no kidding!

But there's nothing more endearing for me than a tale about friendship, family, loss and trying to do the right thing. Last year I read Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, it was my first book by this writer, and while I loved her writing style and narration, I couldn't fully connect with the story, the characters were likeable and the story was full of witty remarks and smart little jokes, but still it was just an ok read, for me. But Jellico Road! oh man! this book broke my heart, but it was so worth it!Jellico Road is centered in Taylor's story, her life, we help her discover where she comes from, what mysteries surrounds her and the people around her, and how everything intertwines with her mother's childhood, her only companion Hannah, the manuscript Hannah is writing and the man that visits Taylor every night in her dreams. This book was magical, really! the atmosphere, the sadness and melancholy aspects of the story are things I've only encountered once or twice in books, and those are the sort of books you go back to from time to time, looking for that little spark of emotion that most YA contemporary lack nowadays. I love how Melina's writing is not pretentious or manipulative, even thought its a very emotional book. I feel like some authors play with our emotions and calculate every scene in their story with some sort of ""cue for crying part"" bits, they manipulate the reader and they plan every aspect of their books, and strategically place the sobfest bits in order to get a reaction from us. Melina does emotional and sadness in a effortlessly manner, and I loved that about this book. Those are the books that really catch me of guard. The only struggle I had with Jellicoe Road were the first 100 pages. It was confusing to read about all this territory wars between the schools and the Cadets, it was not very interesting to me, and I would've like it a lot more if in between all this sort of ""useless"" details we maybe get to know Taylor a bit more. Also, I think the author dedicates too much time in that aspect of the story that serves little purpose at the conclusion and resolution of the problematic in hand. Regardless of my struggles with the first part, I 100% recommend this book! I think all you need is patience and curiosity to not DNF this book. The writing style and pace makes it easy to continue reading, and once you hit the 53% ish mark, you can't put it down. I will definitely will re read this book at some point, and I'm not a big rereader, but this one deserves it. And I will definitely checkout other books by Melina Marchetta, I'm sold on discovering more of her work, if this is just a little taste of what she can do.

I’ve read books by Melina Marchetta before, the Lumatere Chronicles, but this is a contemporary novel and that was a high fantasy series. Completely different worlds, but the execution of the entire story was impeccably done in a way that left me heart broken, jubilant and full of wonder all at the same time. This book was amazing.Jellicoe Road is a book best gone into without really know what it’s about so I’m going to be very vague with the details. Its a book about loss, rivalry, death, pain, confusion, secrets, hopelessness, and fear. But its also about friendship, trust, wonder, faith, family and LOVE. While reading this book I was happy, sad, angry, afraid, confused, I laughed and cried, felt sorry for the characters in some instances and was proud of their triumphs and bravery in others. Every character in this book has a role and every single one of them plays an important part in the overall arc of the story which was a roller coaster ride in and of itself. There were times when I was reading and I felt like there were pieces of the puzzle that I had to find and fit together. And then there were times when I felt like the puzzle was already finished but I had to take it apart and examine each individual piece to really understand what was going on. It was an amazing feeling while reading. Being given little bits and pieces of information but not knowing their significance until hundreds of pages later and realizing just how important a small line or an entire passage was. Melina Marchetta did an amazing job of weaving this intricate and complicated story together in a way that kept me not only invested but actively interested in what was going on at all times. I literally could not put this book down. I had to know what was going on, I had to find the next piece of the puzzle and figure out how it fit into the overall story. An overall story about overcoming adversity and conquering your fears, learning to forgive and allowing yourself to love. An overall story that turned out to be both beautiful and tragic. I know this a very obscure review but just know that this book is definitely worth a read. If you liked Winger by Andrew Smith you will LOVE this book. And if you hated Winger you will LOVE this book. Definitely give it a try. Winger was one of my favorite books of 2014 but it pales in comparison to Jellicoe Road.This book is one of the most heartfelt and poignant books I’ve ever read with a message that is universal to anyone who reads it.

Most of the time I'm not quite sure what I'm feeling. It's some kind of overwhelming empathy and humanity and just pure raw emotion. And every time I get that feeling, I remember why I love books so much. On The Jellicoe Road definitely had that effect on me. I got into this book knowing nothing about it. Nothing at all. Nada. And for the first third of the novel, I was confused. I did not know where it was going, not even sure what was going on. Who are these people? What is this ""war"" they're talking about? What is this? But I'm actually glad I got into this book like that. The introduction was great for what it was ahead of if, the set up for the plot was beautifully done. That kind of introduction was perfect to lead to the mysteries that followed.And once again, I'm so glad I did not know anything coming in. It enhanced the experience. I took in details I may have never had thought of. This is a perfect example of the ""just get into the story without knowing what's about"" kind of book.I kind of fell in love with Marchetta's writing. Even though I was confused at the beginning, I found myself drawn to these words. I had to keep on reading. There's something mesmerizing about how she put together this story. The way the two perspectives were woven together. The darkness of it. I love YA that does not censures itself and this one definitely did not. The grimness of some of the mysteries revealed gave even more dimension to this whole story. The characters, god I love this characters so much. I fell in love with them. I care for them. I wanted so badly to things to go right all the time for them. Although the story got a bit predictive towards the middle that didn't matter cause I cared about the characters. Flawed, three-dimensional, well-written characters. And as usual for me, it was the characters that made me love the story. Plotwise, there were some elements that did not completely fit in and I wished for a more thorough explain, or an explanation at all about these holes. It's such a simple story on a base level, but it does have its intricacies and I do love me some layering.It did not hit me how much I loved and enjoyed this book until I had finished it. Until I thought about it, and the more I think of this book, the more I love it.The bittersweet after taste of that kind of book gave it away. That feeling in my gut. How my chest felt like it was expanding and no matter how much oxygen I'd take in, it wouldn't be enough for it not to be painful.

Yet I failed, which caused me to miss out on this excellent book until now. When I tried reading it previously, I was deterred by the initial chapters. Several characters are introduced and discerning the relations between them is difficult. The narrative voice and year switches without notice, and there is something about a battle between Townies, Cadets, and Houses but it's nearly impossible to figure out what it is. Later on, of course, I realized how crucial these chapters are to the story and their confusing nature sets up much of the plot; however, for a person sitting down to read this without any previous knowledge of the book, I understand why he or she may leave it unfinished. If I recommend this book to anyone (and I likely will since it's fantastic), I will reassure them that the beginning is confusing and hard but it will all make sense in a wonderful book payoff. Besides the beginning, the rest of the book is nearly flawless, except for perhaps some of the ending. Jellicoe Road is a dramatic book, but near the end, I felt like it somewhat descended to melodrama, but maybe that's just my apathetic, unfeeling self talking. I was willing to excuse it because of the book's dramatic nature; I mean, the story commences with an accident involving five fatalities. Squashed between the minorly problematic beginning and end is a glorious middle section crammed with territory games, discoveries of past stories, a magnificent love interest, and even a serial killer! When I remember this novel, though, I'll think of the friendships shared between the original five friends--Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude (even their names are amazing)--and the modern friends--Taylor, Griggs, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben. The adventures of the original five, though tainted with sadness, reminded me of when I was younger, traipsing around with a troop of neighborhood kids, inventing wild games from morning until the moon came up. Although none of my childhood friends died, we are no longer close, so the nostalgia and regret felt by Narnie and Jude reflected something I think all grown-up childhood friends must cope with: the loss of that idyllic time and its relationships.

For at least an hour after finishing On the Jellicoe Road last night, my head was still mulling it over, putting all the pieces in place. I actually got up and re-read some passages, and only then some of the real brilliance came through. This is probably one of those ‘very good’-on-a-first-read-but-‘outstanding’-on-a-re-read books.Melina Marchetta tackles some of the big themes in this book: About parents leaving their children, about tragic events that ripple through the rest of your life and into that of the next generation. About relationships you don’t actually know the significance of, and about the meaning of ‘home’.I do have to admit that this book didn’t have the same emotional gut-punching power her other earth-based young adult novels have (Saving Francesca, The Piper’s Son). I had heaps of Kleenex next to me, but it wasn’t necessary. The only character that came close to getting to me was ‘The Brigadier’: Clearly the good guy, taking care of all the others, desperate to belong, but even the important things he has passed onto other people, like safety and love, are being attributed to someone else in their mis-shapen memories.The story itself has 5 star potential, but I can’t shake the feeling that this book could have been so much better still. Structurally, I believe it was more confusing at the start than it needed to be. Why are we reading the manuscript as a reader before Taylor finds it? Wouldn’t it have been more logic to wait?Content-wise there are a few gaps too that don’t get explained (spoilers ahead): why did Hannah leave without saying a word – it seemed totally out of character? Why did Hannah never mention what her relationship was to Taylor – it seemed like there were many options here? I also could have done with less teen romance to be honest, because the relationship between the adults and the kids are what made this book so exquisite, and the romance angle got in the way for me.Still, it’s a really good young adult novel, and I definitely enjoyed reading it. Somewhere in the middle it became perhaps a bit predictable, but to be honest, I didn’t mind: seeing it come true was emotionally so satisfying that I would have hated any twists and turns in the plot.",5,default,['young-adult']

Finishing this book is one of the reasons that I love reading reviews before I actually read the book. If I hadn't read the reviews I wouldn't have known that every single one of them urges you to keep going--to plod through the beginning and finish the book, and I may have given up and not read past the first 30 pages or so. The first half of this book is like being the lobby of a beautiful hotel in a foreign country. You love your surroundings but you don't know what the hell is going on because no one speaks your language. Eventually the pieces in the story fall into place which allows you to slow down and focus on the words and the feelings behind them rather than spinning madly trying to figure out what is going on. I know that this is a writing technique held in high regard but between us, I thought that the book was wonderful regardless/would have been even more powerful if Marchetta had just let the reader know what was happening from the beginning. It wasn't until I understood the relationship of the characters that I was able to latch onto to them and believe that they were real. Of course, it's not my novel, so who am I to decide? And I understand in retrospect that we were learning the story in the same way that Taylor learned her own story--in bits and pieces and not in chronological order. I spent a lot of the time reading this book with that dry, scratchy feeling that your throat gets right before you are going to cry. It's pretty heartbreaking and the characters are sad in that beautiful, stilled-in-time sort of way. The only thing I can actually say that I disliked about the novel was the whole territory storyline which seemed to dominate the first half and which I didn't really understand. Why would these kids care if townies or cadets were walking on their path? It seemed like such a strange focus of their lives but I figured that maybe you have to be Australian to really appreciate the implications of another teenager invading your territory (or from Texas lol).",5,default,[]

When I read it the first time, about a year ago, I thought it was the best book I had ever read. I still love it but that honor has been replaced by Melina's most recent book ""Finnikin of the Rock"". In any case, Jellicoe Road is fantastic and a book I will cherish for a long time to come.Taylor and Jonah's relationship is INTENSE. In addition to being leaders of opposing teams in the turf war, they have history. Oh, and what a history. They met 3 years earlier and spent a few days together. These few days transformed each of their lives. The beginning of their relationship consisted of each being utterly vulnerable to one another. Even though they didn't see each other or talk in the years that followed, they couldn't possibly forget each other and what happened between them. This history makes their present day interactions heated and explosive. Despite this, there is a tenderness between them that is, at first, so subtle. You see it building through the course of the book into a love that is convincingly true. Actually, you get to see how they fell in love with each other twice, once at age 14 and then presently -- with the first fueling the second. Each of them is fiercely independent and, due to misunderstandings from their earlier history, they are so cold to each other when they meet again in the present. Reading about their relationship conjures up the image of an iceberg melting into warm, soothing spring water. You get to see how these initially strong, negative reactions to one other transform into very strong, loving, self-sacrificing openness to one another. As individuals, they each carry around so much pain. At their best, they are able to offer solace to one another in a way no else can. Loved it.",5,default,['young-adult']

I picked it up and read it. I can see why it is so well-loved. Jellicoe Road is a moving story full of heartache and hope.I'm going to keep this review short because I think it's better to go into the story knowing as little as possible. You're guaranteed to be confused but trust me when I say it's better that way. The mysterious air made the characters much memorable and the story more profound.As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of the story, I was very confused. Nevertheless I found myself completely engrossed in piecing together the stories. There was so much love but also great losses. The closer we got to the big picture, the more anxious and dread I felt. The way the story flowed made it so you know the undeniable truths but you really don't want the reality to be confirmed. Ms. Marchetta skillfully ties everything in. You don't know you needed the little details (view spoiler)[(the postman in Yass lol) (hide spoiler)] until they're given to you.The story of Jellicoe Road is thoughtful and quietly intense. There were many different types of relationships and they were all very sweet. Each subtle on the surface but overflowing with feelings at its center. ""Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love."" (p. 262).The territory war was my favourite. I love a good rivalry and seeing the boarders, Townies and Cadets in action was such good fun. They meant business but not so serious that they couldn't be friends and have some laughs together. Even if no one knew how it all started, it was a meaningful game.A book rich in emotions with excellent characterization, Jellicoe Road is a must-read for readers of all genre and all age.

Like, seriously, if you've heard that this book is complex, profound, absorbing, fascinating, gritty, depressing, and downright flawless...well, you're about to hear it again.Basically, I can't even give you a brief summary, I mean, God knows, there's enough and I just hope you're reading this to get my opinion, not hear another person give you the shortened facts. I wish I could, really, I do, but I feel if I dwell too much on the storyline, I'll completely lose sight of what made this book so magical, and that - in my opinion - is the raw emotions and feelings that a brief summary on the back of a book can't give you.I mean, gosh, it's been less than ten minutes since I finished it and I feel like a basket-case on withdrawel. I've been known to read/adore tragic books (Looking For Alaska by John Green being one of my all-time favorites) but Jellicoe Road takes tragic, depressing, shocking, and haunting to a whole new level, and if you think I'm overreacting or even not thinking straight, then you haven't read this book properly.If I had to pick one qualm about the book, it would be that you really had to perservere past the first 50 pages. Even I was ready to be all like ""Ehh, I don't know if I'll finish this"" most of the time, but I think around page 70 I realized there was no way I could put this book down, crappy or not.Pfft, I can't even talk about the characters, storyline(s), or anything, I'm still reeling.Just...read the book.

This was such a unique story. Taylor is a teenager abandoned by her mother and who now lives at a boarding school. The woman who she is most attached to disappears one day and Taylor is desperate to find out where she went. In the meantime, the school is entrenched in territory wars with students from other organizations, including one led by a boy with whom Taylor has a lot of history. Entwined in this narrative are portions of a story written by the missing woman which offer hints of Taylor’s past. I thought the teenagers were written exceptionally well. Sometimes I just don’t feel like YA authors are writing recognizable teenagers. I love teenagers and teach high schoolers and the conversations and humor that Marchetta has created were so authentic. I love the relationships that were built and the realistic portrayal of their emotions. I have already put a library hold on Marchetta’s other books and look forward to picking them up!

It is imaginative, poetic, emotional, and masterfully written. It is young adult fiction with very mature themes (e.g. childhood trauma, drug addiction, suicide, and death). The characters are broken down to the core, and from the depths of their vulnerability and resiliency, they find themselves. The first 100 pages of this book is confusing. It feels like fragments of a dream that you can’t quite piece together. Then at about 1/3 of the way through, it suddenly clicks, things start to make sense; you feel the haze lifting, and the dream is actually a nightmare that is as devastating as it is uplifting.

I read this book once and immediately re-read it the day after, as, although the layers and complexity of this book make it captivating, it also makes it a bit difficult to piece things together and remember everything. Reading it again makes me appreciate everything this book has to offer so much more. The first section of the book is a bit difficult to swallow, even for the second time reading it, with confusing details that barely make sense, but they got better, and the confusing-ness really reflects the thought process of Taylor Markham, the main character.

First, it’s been on my TBR for ~6 years. I’m glad I finally read it but damn... that hurt. Glad it lived up to the hype from people I know!The blurb doesn’t really give away much so I felt like I went in blind. I’d sell this as a young adult coming-of-age story overall. There’s a bit of romance but I found the mystery aspect the best part along with the stories of the two generations. This is a sad and beautiful story that will stay with me for a while.Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since I initially had issues with the writing. The first 1/3 of the book felt like a slow set-up I could do away with but it got so much better after as things started unraveling. A few things also didn’t age well in this book haha (it was first published in 2006!)",3,newest,"['2021-favorites', '2021', 'favorites-young-adult']"

I flew through this book so quickly that I feel like I need to go back and savour it all again. While the beginning of OTJCR is definitely confusing and seems (almost) dystopian, PERSEVERE! After a hundred or so pages it all becomes clear, and you begin to go deeper with the characters & connect with them. It's one of the best YA novels I think I've ever read; it's real and gritty, with flawed characters that don't make all the right choices, but you at least understand why they do what they do.I'm a sucker for good character development, and I do feel like Taylor - and some of the supporting characters to a lesser extent (Jude! Jonah!)- go through quite a bit of change; I love watching as characters learn to open up and let people in. I really liked the 2 timelines, and trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle and figure it out. The more I think about it, the more parallels I can see between the 2 friend groups and their stories. (I love way the 2nd group is kind of a redemption of the 1st, and they come out even stronger). The friendships that are formed are my favourite part, I loved Chaz, Raffy, Jonah!!, and Taylor. Around 60% I did figure out the biggest ""reveal"", but I was still eager to see how the characters would find out. It's a beautifully written book about broken, hurting people and the friendships that save them. (I'm a sucker for cool friend groups, they made me think of the Marauders in a way).",0,newest,[]

I don't recommend it. From reading other reviews, I'm not alone in this thinking. This story is SUPER confusing and requires your undivided attention.

I totally didn't get that in the audiobook.I think I like the premise, but there are things about it that I just thought were pointless-like the territory wars. I still don't understand how that had any bearing on the actual story. It seemed kind of pointless and added to the confusion. The first half of the book is incredibly confusing.

Melina Marchetta did it again, she wrenched my heart. This book was really… something. It started off very confusing, not going to lie, therefore hard to stick to it. Kids talking about House leaders and territory wars and what faction owns what and Taylor’s very difficult personality and my attention span was not having it. It was also hard to differentiate what was a POV, what was a flashback and a dream, it took me until chapter 9, where our protagonist mentions one of the original 5’s name as part of a story she is reading that I realized what was what from whom. And then, Taylor grew on me just like her house girls grew on her and I understood her and where she was coming from and I just could not stop reading. I just needed to know what happened to these 5 kids and I just needed Taylor to get her answers and I needed to know how all their lives were connected. Marchetta has a talent for that, knotting people’s lives in her stories in such a beautiful way. I have so much love for Taylor and Jonah and Raffaela and Chaz and Ben and Jessa even Anson Choi and the Mullet Brothers. It was beautiful to see their friendship bloom. I had the strong need to protect every single one of these characters throughout the whole book.I am in love with the way Marchetta writes emotions, and how strongly you can feel her characters feel them. She also has a talent for presenting you a character who you might not see in a good light at the beginning and instead of giving them this miraculous redemption arc, she explains their reasons and you, without noticing, accept this character, root for them.

It was intense and gripped me so much that I almost couldn't believe it was YA fiction. It's a book centred on teenaged characters, but it feels very mature, and a lot of the subject matter is heavy and dark - I don't think I could imagine myself reading this as a teenager. I thought the way the author connected the characters and tied up all the storylines was very elegant. Half the story is written from the main character, Taylor Markham's perspective, while the other half is written in italics. At first it was really difficult to keep the two storylines and numerous characters separate, but at the end, it becomes very clear and every character is significant and has a clear connection to each storyline. I took 1 star away because I thought the ""territory war"" between the Townies and the Cadets seemed juvenile and out of place. I felt that it wasn't as realistic as it could have been, because the characters seemed so mature, and at the same time they were participating in some odd war game. I wish the plot didn't centre so much on the territory war since it was pretty insignificant near the end. Anyway - if you are a fan of YA fiction and are looking for something that is well-written and mature, I would recommend this one.

As she tries to learn and understand her new role as a leader and fight off those intending to vote her out, her past begins to catch up with her. She knows that her friend Hannah knows more about her past than she has let on, but when Hannah goes missing Taylor is left wondering just how much she knows. The leader of the cadets is Jonah, another reminder of her past that she is forced to reconcile. Trying to juggle a pretend war, school, her past, and the sudden vanishment of Hannah leaves Taylor struggling to understand herself and what's important. I found myself relating to Taylor a lot more than I thought I would. Her struggle with her mental health because of her past is relatable and heartwarming. Hannah's story is also being told during the novel, and while I enjoyed it sometimes it took me out of the story that I typically found myself right in the middle of. I was rooting for the main characters the entire time and appreciated how unique tone of voice the author had. ◦ Sexual Abuse◦ Child Neglect◦ Drug Abuse◦ Themes of Suicide ",0,newest,['books-1-10']

Grand reveals aren't as exciting when you have been waiting for the usually-smart protagonist to finally have her ""aha"" moment after waiting 200 pages (and she doesn't even figure out 75% of it by herself, the rest has to be told to her).But it was still a moving book that I can't quite bring myself to rate as three stars like I had been planning.

At times I had to really prompt myself to view all of this from my 15 year old self; reading this is as an adult is humbling. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unnatural, especially in how the boys interact with each other and it was somewhat off putting, if I were being hypercritical I’d say it perpetuates the toxic trope of men’s aggression and emotional repression.

If I searched for the finest combination of words and managed to come up with a pragmatic sentence like “this book was a primal example of top-notch storytelling”, it would be like diminishing the lengths of its emotional reach just to make it fit in a closed space of category, turn it into something you can shelve and put away, and it deserves more than that. Marchetta’s story was an orchestra of paradoxes that exploded and sunk into itself at the same time — it talked about love and hate, comfort and grief, harvesting and destruction, life and death. It talked about friendships and war and how sometimes it can only take one second for your entire world to fall apart, burn into dust. And I can’t even begin to express how reading it felt so heavy, like the weight of gravity was suddenly pressing down on me, and the cold melancholy it oozed out of every chapter frosted my fingertips and made me feel numb. I don’t know if my next sentence will make sense, but this was the type of story that makes you feel like you’ve drunk too much and that the world is moving too fast for your hungover brain to keep up with everything — which is good. Art means a whole lot more when it is capable of inciting emotions of that caliber in someone.Don’t ask me to explain the logistics of this book. It was confusing and a little nauseating at first, seeing the feud between the Cadets, the school and the Townies present itself with scattered pieces and chaotic figures. But trust me when I say that the unfolding of the thread that binds these three forces is an experience unlike anything you’ve read before. Through the painfully nostalgic perspective of Taylor, the story behind the accident that happened in Jellicoe Road and of the people who lost a family but gained another because of it appears like colorful dust in the air and reading about it is like trying to grab everything at once. But your hands get stained and there’s still so much to see and you want to consume this book all at once even though it’s so sad and inflammable that it hurts. I loved it so much but... Damn I need a walk-in-the-park of a read after it, an Emily in Paris but in book form, basically.

Jellicoe Road is insanely sentimental, and if you don't have a stomach for that kind of thing, this is a tough hang. It is the most YA book of all time, and I mean that in a lot of the good ways and all of the annoying ways that implies. It's not an exaggeration to say the main character has an emotional breakdown every five pages. The number of tears shed in this book could power a water park or keep a family alive in the desert. I'm all for tears, but when every moment is given equal hurricane-esque emotional weight, it's hard to take them as seriously. (Then again, that's basically what it's like to be in high school, so it's not like it's inaccurate.)The ending is really strong, and I think the afterglow skews the ratings a bit, because the rest of the book is less so. Then again, I am not 14 years old, and this book isn't for me :) So I should probably stop talking. If nothing else, this book is genuine and deeply felt.",3,newest,[]

At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor’s the reluctant leader of her school’s underground community, but her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. When Hannah disappears Taylor’s search for her unveils a truth that might not just settle her past, but also change her future.The story is told in two different timelines, the past via a manuscript that Taylor finds, and the present. It’s so well-written and planned in every little detail and so suspenseful in how it slowly reveals the connections between events in the past and present times. It’s a beautiful story about friendship, but it also deals with a lot of heavy topics such as violence, death, grief, loneliness and desire to belong, suicide and self-harm.This book is so emotional and happy and sad at the same time. I had smiles and tears all over my face while reading it. It’s a book that made me suffer and that broke my heart, but it also made me so happy and I just loved every little thing about it! I cannot even try to explain how special and wonderful this book is, more than to say that I recommend it with all my heart!",0,newest,['tearjerkers']

A day and a half later, after I turned the last page of this book, I wondered how in the world I hadn't picked it up before.If you like reads where a past story mixes with the present, this one's for you. I really appreciated the flow of the book. It was easy-paced and suspenseful enough. I didn't really like the final mystery-reveal-slash-plot-twist, but it made the story all the more unique.I've got a secret love for the kind of conflict like the ""territory war"" in On the Jellicoe Road. No weapons, just teens trying to outsmart each other following the idea of a war but without casualties. In this aspect, this book has got a lot of 
The War of the Buttons
 in it.IMO, the character growth throughout the story is worth the read. The dynamics. The growing friendships. The book starts cold and progresses towards warm. I can't say more (let's avoid spoilers, shall we) but there is a beautiful underlying message of how, most of the times, conflicts are unnecessary and founded on flimsy reasons.

It's got a very interesting first line which holds a lot of promise but the following chapters are very slow and can be confusing. The author also assumes that the readers are familiar with their local school system so it contributed to my confusion too. Now the biggest problem with this book is that it took around 150-200 pages until things really make any sense and a lot of people will understandably DNF this before getting to the turning point where the book lands an impact.
“My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted.
Whether the final pivotal chapters are worth all the build up pages is really dependent on if you're reading this with others or solo. This is definitely a good book for discussion but it's also the kind of book that's very polarizing. I think this line basically sums up what kind of experience this book will take you on:
""What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?""“When we get there, you’ll understand.""

It doesn’t use exaggerated language to describe tragic events. But it describes it in simple language like it is a fact of life until it roots in you deeply. That this is, indeed, life. A culmination of ugly and beautiful things that most often we don’t get to choose. We get dealt a lot and it depends on how we play the cards. The realization crept up on me slowly, until the story settled within my skin. I couldn’t read a book for a few days after because it was hard to get this story out of my mind. And that in itself is the mark of a five-star read.I love how effortlessly Marchetta weaves the tale of Fitz, Tate, Web, Narnie and Jude that took place so long in the past alongside Taylor’s own story and interspersing it with the tiny amusements of the Territory war that allowed friendships to grow between Taylor and the contemporaries from the other school. There are enough light moments to balance the dark ones out so that the book doesn’t become a total grief fest.Read the full review here - https://thezoyaproject.com/2017/12/21...",0,newest,[]

But the journey it took to get there was just so needlessly convoluted. I just felt the construction of this story didn't work for me. It's like it was doing everything possible to confuse me by constantly flitting between present and dreams and Hannah's story, but I don't feel like it actually added anything to the overall story by doing that. Like I still guessed all the revelations and it didn't make it more impactful by confusing me the entire time, I feel like if it was told in a less random time-jump way I could've felt these moments a lot more. There's these great emotional beats at the end that honestly didn't hit me the way I knew they should have because it took so long to get to it. Also the beginning plot of their 'house wars' or whatever was as dumb as it sounded and legit led nowhere. It felt like such ridiculous forced conflict and wasn't even well explained enough for me to care. It took itself far too seriously and I found myself eye-rolling for a lot of it and waiting for the real meat of the story to happen. I also found the main relationship and Taylor herself super grating. All of their decisions are beyond frustrating and I know they're teenagers and I know they need to grow in their arc, but I didn't really find myself routing for them for most of the book. By the end I enjoyed them enough separately that I was like, 'ok sure, fine' but again didn't hit me the way I felt it should've. Overall this book was just super weird. It's certainly different and I'm all for fresh ideas, but it just didn't do it for me at all. Not my fav, but I can see why others may have enjoyed it more.",0,newest,['read-in-2020']

I ran to my library to get a copy after seeing a quote on Instagram. I had no idea that seeing that quote would lead me to my favorite book of all time! But since it was my favorite when I was just starting high school, I was scared that if I re-read it now that I’m older, it wouldn’t be my favorite anymore. I didn’t want the idealized version that I had in my head to leave, so I put off my re-read for years.Until I slipped into a reading slump and couldn’t stop thinking about it and found a beautiful new copy at a bookstore I only stumbled across and said “hey, this is fate.” And here I am at 2am clutching this masterpiece of a novel as close to my chest as possible wishing I could literally bury it physically into my heart because it was somehow so much better than the version I had in my head. I am cursing at myself for waiting so long to pick it up again and I am crying because I have too many feelings about this book.This will put you through it, okay? It will send you through such a spiral of emotions that in the end I promise you will be clutching it to your body just as I am right now and I promise that it will NEVER leave you. This is the only book I have ever read that I can just never stop thinking about.The characters are everything, the plot is everything, this book is EVERYTHING.It could be a little confusing in the beginning, but that’s only because you are trying to piece together Taylor’s life along with her. You feel every bit of emotion and confusion Taylor feels, and I think that is just the best kind of confusion.If I haven’t already convinced you, let me leave you with this: whenever I see this book in a store, I have a physical reaction. When I see it new, I literally almost cry and thank whatever god or force there is out there that the store even carries it and I clutch it and shake as I bring it up to the counter to buy it in a heartbeat. When I see it in a thrift store I have to just stand there in shock because I can’t imagine why anyone would get rid of it! And then of course I buy it even though I already have multiple copies because it is the book that makes me feel like it isn’t just a bundle of paper.

At the age of 7, Taylor was abandoned by her mom at a 7-Eleven in Jellicoe. When she was 14, Taylor attempted to run away to Sydney to find her mom. But the boy she was with called for help, and her journey was cut short. Three years later, Taylor is now the head of her House at Jellicoe school, and she must take lead in the annual territory wars between the school, the Townies and the Cadets. But when Hannah, the closest thing Taylor has to a parent, Taylor starts down a path of discovery that will reveals a tragic history on the Jellicoe Road. One that she is a part of. I truly enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed the territory wars between the three factions and how this year's leaders have entangled histories with each other. As this novel is told from Taylor's POV, it is interesting to see her view of things contrasted against the dialogue of other characters. There is a particular instance where we learn that despite Taylor's behavior, the girls in her house truly care about her. There book contains lessons on friendship, the pain and healing found in tragedy, and how a single life event can completely alter the course of ones life. The story has a few triggers. It mildly touches on drugs and the destruction they bring about, and there is one mention of child pedophilia. However, suicide plays a heavier hand in the book.Looking back on the book, I realize there are plenty of characters involved in the story that I wish we got to know a bit better. In the moment, I was caught up in Taylor's experiences, but I would have loved to know more about Jonah, Chaz and Rafaela's histories. Also, I got stuck for a moment between the epilogue and chapter 1. The book states there is a 22 year time gap, but when chapter 1 starts, Taylor is 17 years old. Took me a few minutes longer than it should have to think ""Oh, Taylor must not be one of the people involved in the epilogue.""Overall, a great read. This is the second work of Melina Marchetta I've read. I enjoy her writing style and stories, so I'll definitely be checking out her other works!",0,newest,['mandy-s-bookshelf']

I loved this book. It made me nostalgic of my childhood and reminded me of the 'gangs' we would form in my tiny primary school of just 40 kids, where each gang had a peppercorn tree as their base and there would be battles for territory and people. One gang even made a tunnel. So I found the main storyline and premise of the territory wars between the Jellicoe School, the cadets and the townies absolutely believable. Melina Marchetta can write such amazing and complex characters, and Taylor Markham is the perfect example. At times Taylor is all about Taylor, but she is also vulnerable and can bring people together. I don't even know what to write to do this book justice, there are so many good things in the mix. I was sad to finish the book and leave the characters behind (there were real tears), but I hope to return to them another time in the future.

I couldn’t really appreciate much of what went on in the earlier chapters as a twenty-year-old but it’s the kind of storytelling that would have compelled me to write more nuance to my material at that age instead of going stagnant in my later teens.Marchetta offered little distinctions to set out a clearer picture of the grounds or the characters but I take it down as personal style and it’s not like it worked against her. The focus she set upon literary devices such as a Chekhov’s Gun was pronounced enough for younger readers to appreciate without making it unnecessarily complex. The text was haunting and wistful. It’s not the kind that would have made it difficult for me to put down but if I do, I’d somehow regret it because the story is littered with bits and pieces that are easily relevant to the plot later. I did get a little annoyed at some points when something is mentioned or introduced and the reader was expected to just take that in as it is despite how slightly important it is to remember it later in the story. It was a good piece. Yet I personally didn’t appreciate how the intentionally dispersed excerpts muddled the story in a way that hindered it rather than stylise or emphasise the plot.",0,newest,[]

And I don’t quit books easily. However, at 35% percent into the story, the writer should have provided a general overview, but this novel was entirely directionless. Without the blurb, I would not have had a clue what is going on. This scene threw me off: a panel of senior students from a boarding school discussing territorial rights with the leaders of the local school kids and a neighbouring military school. In fact, the council is about access to waterways - as if any of them had any actual claim to the land. This territorial dispute is never even properly explained. The novel seems to have two main characters. On the one hand, there is Taylor, now 17 [I will never understand the trend to upgrade occupations into female first names], who at 11 was abandoned by her mother at a petrol station, and at 14 tried to run away from said boarding school to find her mother. On the run, she somehow fraternized with Jonah, a ""Cadet"" and now her antagonist. However, this backstory is structured as one big secret with only morsels of information thrown in. Taylor is also a particularly mopey, unappealing character. Yawn. Then there is Hannah, a woman in her 30s who survived a car crash as a child. She lives on the school premises and is Taylor’s friend. Somehow she is a main character, even though she has been missing since page 1. Again, lots of mysterious hints.

As much as it was heartbreakingly tragic, I enjoyed the cynical humor that the characters possessed and I found myself laughing out loud so many times.“If something happens to me, whose face will be on the front page of the paper begging for me?

Years later, she is the leader of the Jellicoe School students and is somewhat cynical due to the betrayals she has experienced throughout the years. However, she isn't the only one to face such hardships. Throughout the book, different characters face the struggles and trauma that burden them. As Taylor confronts her past, she learns more about love, friendship, and healing. Reaction: I love how the author expressed Taylor's thoughts and feelings. She is an interesting character, sharing some special quirks to which I can relate. For example, in the very first chapter, she mentions certain words that are perfect for describing her situation. That is such a small thing, but it caught my attention. Even though I appreciate her character, I am saddened by the experiences she faces in the novel. She and the other characters have some pretty serious trauma. It caused me to reflect on my own life and feel very grateful for my circumstances. Content Warnings: There are certain events such as murder, death, and suicidal thoughts. Domestic violence is also mentioned, along with side-effects of trauma, such as depression and anxiety. Some brief allusions to sexual activity. Mention of sexual assault. ",0,newest,['13-25']

The wars is very simple but the resolution of the war is not executed well I think because it just suddenly dissolves over the holiday break and also SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! it is a not so mind blowing that the wars is just an invented game. HERE IS WHAT I LOVE, I love that all that story in the first half slowly interweaves and make sense onto the second half of the book. That is if you remember the deets in the first half. More revelations coming in which I will not spoil thats just heart warming and endearing. It is like a puzzle that you have to figure out piece by piece in order to fit. I was definitely able to predict who is who and which is which. The pace is engaging on the second half but the first half is so-so. I wish I have seen more about Tate perspective or at least a background of it. Overall I enjoyed reading it despite the trecherous first half.I HAVE TO BE HONEST this is not a wow book for me. I mean it was okay, but not the same reaction that the majority has...I get tripped off and put off by the switching of persepctive sometime. There are times I have to go back to tell who was talking. And sometimes I could not take the insensitiveness of Taylor even though she has a very tragic past and maybe a rough childhood I will not be able to justify her rudeness with those. I mean come on she supposed to be a leader right! But I felt like there are parts that she is so self centered. Yes I get that Hannah is missing and she's her rock but blowing off Jessa or Chloe like that is just I hate her in thoseI HAVE TO TALK ABOUT JONAH. I wish there were more back stories about him. I really want to know what happen between him and his father. Also I wanna know why he wanted to do what he wants to do in that train station where he met Taylor.TOWNIES, CADETS AND THE REST OF THE PLOTI wish that there are more deets about the war, how did the townies had the claim for the prayer tree and why Taylor and the Jellicoe school lost it last year. I wish they have made known that the war was an invented game not just made a party which forces all three groups to mibgke which other with no explanation whatsoever except that fact that Taylor and Jonah pashed. I hope more background on Rafaella and Santangelo to tell who they really are personally. Also again to Tate, I hope they have met properly.I know I am part of the few, but I'll tty to reread it and see if my view chabe because the book has BEAUTIFUL WRITING you can really feel the HEAVINESS OF THE EMOTIONS CLINGING ONTO THE WORDS.",0,newest,[]

I could see all the boundaries, and I could feel the summer air. I loved that this story was set in a country town of Australia, but it didn't have the usual dry Australian language to describe it - that was almost my favourite part. The characters, wow.

I've completely immersed myself the characters' incredibly realistic lives, facing horrors that they have been forced to behold. The psychological depth of the characters is insanely complex, which is probably the highlight of this book. Living in the heart of Sydney rather than the rural setting of Jellicoe Road, I don't think I ever understood how different the culture is there, and how people living in those areas see Sydney in such a different light. It was especially jarring to see familiar suburbs and australian jargon mentioned, especially since I had NO idea that this book was in any way australian. I have no idea how non-australian readers would get every single reference, like the school level system eg. ""year eleven"" or the popular TV show Home and Away. On a kind of unrelated note, Kings Cross is MUCH safer today, which is why I was so shocked at the description the book gave.I still have to say, the plot was very confusing even to the end, and the construction of the plot had little logical sense, even if it moved character arcs forward and clues into light. For example, the warring tribe system between the Cadets, Townies and the Houses absurdly seemed to be taken too seriously one moment and then the rules were very quickly ignored the next. There was a lack of motive and reason why characters chose to do certain things, like breaking into the Brigadier's tent and having a party at the Club House. These could almost be plot holes, but I'm willing to put them away as devices to make the story more efficient.Overall I'm rather conflicted on how to rate this.

Reasons why I didn’t give it more stars-predictable plot.

I think many people had this problem too and I guess it’s part of the whole setup of the book. But I think the whole subplot with the territorial wars was kinda unnecessary and boring. -romance. I think I’m in the minority here. I didnt really care much about Griggs. I kinda found their relationship boring and a bit cringe to read honestly.

(i promise you this isn't the whole plot and also it gets really confusing at the beginning.) hannah, her guardian/mentor, disappears and it sends taylor looking for clues to find her, which leads to taylor uncovering her past. all of that heaviness occurs in the midst of teenage shenanigans so it's the perfect blend of light and heavy. i liked this book. it took a while for me to vibe with it because the whole territorial wars did not make sense to me at all and quite frankly, i don't really know if it makes sense to the characters either. if you can't get past that, then i don't think the whole story is for you. in any case, i resolved to finish this book so i forced myself to get through it—which turned out to be not such a chore as marchetta's writing is easy to read and the characters and the hints at their relationships are fun. there's also the matter of shifting POVs through flashbacks, but the flashbacks are in italics so it's easy to distinguish. the whole kids in love during the summer was great and fun, but it blindsides you and leaves you vulnerable for what's to come. because when it gets to around the 250-ish page mark, that's when you know that shit is about to go down. and go down it did because the story gave me such complete heartache. i'm completely torn apart by the events at the end. the characters were great although i didn't really connect with them, i was definitely attached. i liked how the taylor/jonah/raffy/chaz friendship was written and i cried even more over ""what are you so sad about? we're going to know him for the rest of our lives."" honestly, out of the original five, jude was a surprise character for me because it hurts to think about him. he's kind of the outsider of the group, longing to be a part of it but when he does, it's under the most terrible circumstances. this book was by no means perfect. as i said, the beginning was a little difficult to get into. i may be in the minority but i didn't really care about the romance—i understand that the author draws parallels between taylor/jonah and both webb/tate and narnie/jude but uh it's not for me. they had a good enemies to lovers thing going on and a shared past but they were just okay if not a little too intense for me. it also had two sex scenes that the book could have gone without. minor things in the midst of how much the story touched me. overall, this was a good read and if you're in the mood to cry and read about deep and life-changing friendships then this is the book for you.

On The Jellicoe Road is about so many things, but at its heart it's about memory, trauma, learning to forget, and having to remember again. It's the least condescending book I have ever read - there's no all-knowing narrative voice that's telling us what's going on. Instead we try to piece things together just as Taylor does, through fragments of her childhood memories, dreams, and extracts from an unfinished book found in an unfinished house. But this book is also about other things I love to see in contemporary fiction for teens. Friendship and romance and how kids & teens find their chosen families and do everything they can to care for each other. And then there's the territory wars - this book recognizes that kids and teens have their own games, economies, traditions, and histories. I loved everything about this book. I read it over six weeks and incidentally, that's how long the plot is paced over too!

But it’s also about the beautiful memories. The memories of love from the past that keep you holding on, fighting, to see the future. This story absolutely broke me.

Despite the tragic backdrop to the story, it still feels so beautiful and uplifting to read. At first I was extremely confused with exactly what was going on, but once I learned that the territory wars are just a game, the book became a lot more easier to read. The book is about a girl named Taylor Markham whose drug-addicted mom left her with Hannah, her caretaker for the meantime. It follows her journey as she uncovers more about her past and takes part, alongside her friends, in these “territory wars” between the Cadets and the Townies. This book is very unique to me, and its style is different from anything else I’ve read. The story deals with such dark themes, yet Taylor takes these made-up territory wars with her friends very seriously. To me, it added this imaginative and whimsical nature to the book which almost felt out of place since the story gets so dark. Also, although the book was very confusing in the beginning, I actually came to appreciate that because it makes us empathize more with Taylor who’s also left in the dark with her own past.",0,newest,[]

I liked hearing the voices of Taylor, Jonah, Chaz and Raffy, and everyone else, I thought the narrator - Rebecca Macauley - did a good job of it, making different voices for everyone and her guy-voices were pretty good. Also, I noticed stuff about the characters that I hadn't before, like that Taylor was a bit of a Drama Queen, something that I had never noticed before. On the down side, the musical transitions between chapters and between past and present were too long and they got kind of annoying after a while.

blog review
.This is one of those books that 1) you should go into not knowing much of anything, 2) that will probably leave you very confused for the first 100 pages or so, but 3) is ultimately one you’ll end up loving, or at the very least appreciating the cleverness behind the structure. Preferably you’ll have read one of Melina’s other books before (and if we’re speaking of “preferably,” that book will have been Looking for Alibrandi, because I think it’s better than Saving Francesca), so you’ll know Melina’s a fine writer who knows what she’s doing and isn’t just getting sloppy.It’s hard to say what Jellicoe Road is about exactly—I don’t want your reading experience to be ruined. And anyway, even if I did tell you what it’s about, this novel has so many facets, it’s hard to give a full picture without making you sit down and read it. It’s a mystery novel about finding yourself; it’s a family story about a girl who is, for all intents and purposes, an orphan; it’s a story about friendship for a girl who always thought she was alone; and it’s about a road that, immobile as it is, is constantly changing to the eye of each beholder. It’s no wonder this novel is so confusing at first—it’s a paradox of itself.Anyway, as I was saying in the beginning, this book’s different, in structure as much as plot. There are two main storylines, one from the past—seventeen years before—and one in the present. The Past one tells the story of five teenagers who were friends, family, and couples, all of whom had special ties to the Jellicoe Road. The Present one tells the story of one lone teenage girl who’s been abandoned by her mother, who’s got no recollection of her father, and who has no other family to speak of. The Present is told in real time through Taylor’s first person narration; the Past is told through manuscript pages written by a woman who’s been like a mother—but not really a mother—to Taylor ever since she was abandoned. The book basically keeps going with each storyline until both merge and you see how they’re connected.Like I said: this isn’t a book I’ve—or you’ve, I’d wager—read before. It’s original and elusive, and, when all is said and done, brilliant. It kept me at bay, grasping for clues where there just weren’t any until everything made sense in a way I wouldn’t have guessed.I’d like to say there’s a bit in here for everyone. You’ve got your romance, your twisting-and-turning plot, your poetic prose, your instant solid characters, and your underlying passionate and solid storytelling.Possibly on my list of favorite YA books ever, probably my favorite Melina Marchetta, and definitely on my top ten for this year (US release date, of course).

She does find comfort though in a manuscript that Hannah has written about a group of five friends who met in the worst circumstances, but delved a remarkable friendship when they only had each other. When Hannah just up and leaves, Taylor doesn't understand what has happened and she becomes a wreck. Not only does she have to deal with Hannah's disappearance, but she has just been named the head of her House and the leader of the school kids in the annual territory wars against the ""Townies"" and ""Cadets."" In the war the three groups battle and negotiate following an extensive set of rules that might as well be history. As the war wages on Taylor learns to take an active role in her community as well as develop relationships that she never thought possible. Especially with Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets whom she already has quite a history with already. This war will be like no other. It will not only be between the normal three parties, but among friends, hearts desires, and most of all Taylor herself.From the title I was expecting a light and fun read. Wow, was I wrong. This book is filled with heartbreak, joy, laughter and sorrow. It completely blew me away and surpassed every expectation I had, even though I was expecting something completely different. Before I even get into the elements of the story I have to comment on how much talent the author has. Melina Marhetta's writing style is indescribable. It seemed that she was so comfortable writing the story and her words just flowed from page to page with great clarity. I loved how the author weaved many intricate details and mini-stories into one big story, making it like a puzzle that slowly comes together until those last couple of pieces which just fall into place. The only miff I had with this book is that it took me probably until the third chapter to actually understand what was going on. In the beginning there were two stories going on and it was hard to wrap my head around everything that was happening. After that though it seemed the author settled into writing and the story took off. Taylor without a doubt is one of the best characters that I think has ever been created. She has this true voice where you can hear and feel her emotion ring out. By the time the book had ended I felt like I knew Taylor like I know my best friends. While Taylor was the main character, the author did a fabulous job creating the other characters. Unlike many supporting characters, the characters in Jellicoe Road all had their own voices and became their own person with a real and likable personality. I highly recommend this book to readers everywhere. Whether you're a girl or a guy, you will treasure this novel and hold it near and dear to your heart for a long time to come. Jellicoe Road is a beautiful love story, a heart wrenching story of loss, a poignant self-discovery, and most of all an unforgettable tale. It is by far one of the best books of the year.",0,oldest,[]

It's different from Marchetta's other books. And there are also two stories going on at the same time so working that out took a few chapters. It's a sad book, yet at the same time so readable and enjoyable. Marchetta is extremely talented at creating likable characters. I actually read it twice in four days.

But I'm so disappointed to say that I couldn't get through it... It's a very odd story about Taylor, a girl who lives at a boarding school since being abandoned by her mother at age 11. Each fall, the students at the school engage in a ""war"" with the townies and a group of cadets that come to camp in the woods near the school. Each team has their own territory, and there are constant skirmishes between the groups. Taylor is appointed the leader of her group, so the book is divided into a plotline about the battle, but interspersed with stuff about Taylor's past life and the mystery behind her mom's disappearance.

She wrote a very popular book called Looking for Alibrandi which is studied by most high school students. Marchetta has a gift for exploring themes relevant to teenagers and this is shown in another of her novels, Saving Francesca, and now On the Jellicoe Road as well.On the Jellicoe Road is about the life of a young girl named Taylor who is abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road and becomes resident of a nearby boarding school. She develops a close relationship with the woman who found her, Hannah, but when Hannah disappears, Taylor's world starts to crumble, and she realises she must find out what happened to her own mother.The plot actually goes much deeper than what I've described, and for the first half of the book, it's rather a confusing process trying to follow the characters (there is a separate story running throughout and it takes a while to get the gist of what's going on).

Taylor also has to deal with Jonah Griggs, a cadet she ran away with in year seven, who betrayed her. Now he is the leader of the Cadets and anger from the past resurfaces as well as feelings neither of them can explain. On Jellicoe road you find the importance of friendship, the gutt-wrenching loss of family, and the ever present element of love.

I found the whole ultra-mysterious 'brooding' tone pretentious and the romance between the characters was too melodramatic for my taste. Although I'm sure it will ring true for adolescent girls everywhere who will no doubt be all 'OMG I can totally relate to Taylor because she is like, so INTENSE and has had so much EMOTIONAL TRAUMA in her life, just like ME!'Besides that, though, I thought the mystery part of it was poorly done. A lot of people are saying in their reviews that they found it 'confusing', at least at first - and it is.

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,"" and that was the last thing he ever said. We heard her almost straightaway. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead--just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives. Someone asked us later, ""Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?"" Did I wonder? When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of garbage, don't you know? Wonder dies.Powerful, isn't it? I won't lie...Jellicoe Road is a difficult read in many different ways. But worth it? Yes! Resoundingly yes! Why is it difficult? It weaves two stories together. The stories are seemingly unconnected...at least in the beginning. And because you--the reader--don't know what is going on...it's easy to get frustrated. Easy to get confused. We've got the past--from which the prologue serves as an introduction--and the present. (In a way it reminds me of Tamar.)The present. We've got several teens whose lives intersect--Taylor Markham, Ben Cassidy, Jonah Griggs, Chaz Santangelo, Raffaela, Jessa McKenzie--of whom Taylor is the main character. Taylor doesn't know where she fits in, ""One day when I was eleven, my mother drove me out here and while I was in the toilets at the 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, she drove off and left me there. It becomes one of those defining moments in your life, when your mother does that. It's not as if I don't forgive her, because I do"" (20). Taylor is one of many students at Jellicoe School, a boarding school; she's the leader of her dorm or ""house"". (There are six houses.) And the school tradition is that there are ""wars"" between three sects--those that live at the boarding school (led by Taylor), the Townies (led by Chaz Santangelo), and the Cadets (led by Jonah Griggs). These wars involve territories. And these games last six weeks or so. And they're a big deal for those involved. But what at first seems like a senseless, pointless book on children playing war--tactical strategies, trapping, pranking, and such--soon turns into an emotional journey of the heart, soul, and mind.Taylor Markham is concerned, worried, anxious about Hannah, a woman who is the closest thing she has to family, when she disappears without a word. One day she's there, the next day she's gone. And Taylor can't get a straight word out of any of the adults around at the school or in the town about Hannah's whereabouts. Taylor--though Hannah is still missing--likes to take refuge in Hannah's house. She loves to read Hannah's manuscript, for example, which is the story of five kids who live on Jellicoe Road: Tate, Narnie, Webb, Fitz, and Jude.I don't want to spoil this one in any way. But I think this *may* help readers out a bit. I didn't catch on that the italicized portions--the stories of Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, etc.--were written down stories. That Taylor was reading something Hannah had written down. I'm still not sure all of them are meant to be. But I think some of them are. And it is these stories which help Taylor to piece everything all together. (I had assumed that they were flashbacks. That they were there for the reader's benefit, but not for the characters within the book.)This is a book that had to grow on me. It wasn't one that I knew I would love--or thought I would love--from the very first page. But by the time the story comes together, by the finale, it had me completely won over. The story is intricately told and well written. Haunting, yes. Bittersweet, definitely. But one that I think is worth reading and recommending.© Becky Laney of Becky's Book Reviews ",3,oldest,[]

I love the poetry, the mystery, and the fact that it's meant for ""young adults."" I bought this book while in Australia, read it when I was slaving away for an English family cleaning house and horse stalls for a few weeks, and cried like a baby all the way through. Since then I've read it probably six more times. It's not very long, and was an easy read out loud to my roommates (they said they enjoyed it, I swear). The story takes place out in the ""bush"" of Southeastern Australia and delves into the emotional plight of two generations of teenagers from this town, which all stems from one horrible car wreck that happened along the Jellicoe Road. Although the beginning is confusing at first, it's well written, super fun, and incredibly tragic. ",0,oldest,[]

I didn't find the characters compelling or interesting. To be totally honest, I thought it was quite predictable. Although I clearly didn't figure out *everything* at the end, I knew from page 5 that the characters in the manuscript were somehow the ones acting in Taylor's history. So, that said, no shock.I thought that there was no reason to care about Taylor. We know little about her for 300 pages, except that she's got mommy fixation. Even in the end, I still didn't care about Taylor nor understand why I should care about her. I felt like the last 100 pages were the best in the book in terms of writing, action, and story. I wish a lot at the start could have been cut OR could have been better fleshed out in terms of character development. I think there were too many characters without any defining features who just became names to me. All of that said, I think this book definitely would have its readers. I think a lot of reluctant readers would have a hard time with this one because it requires reading the whole book. I think it might even require two readings. In terms of writing, Marchetta can paint some nice images for sure. She can also paint quite brutal ones. Sensitive readers might be put off by this one, since it's quite brutal in parts. Alas, the book earns a 3 star because I might, in the future, reread it to see if I missed something. If a book I don't care for a whole lot can compel me to consider rereading, then maybe something's there. I'm not quite sure why this one, out of many other great contenders, achieved the Prinz.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years. Elegiac passages and a complex structure create a somewhat dense, melancholic narrative with elements of romance, mystery, and realistic fiction.-Suzanne Gordon, Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GA Copyright 2008 Reed Business Information.""",0,oldest,[]

Marchetta reveals just a little at a time and you need to know the whole story just as much as the protagonist. It's brilliant!I know this doesn't say much about the plot or what the book is about... but as others have said, this is a book you just have to read to understand. I was a bit lost for the first half of the book, trying to figure out what the heck was going on, and how these two different stories relate to each other. Once I made some connections, I couldn't put it down. Once you get past the initial feeling of ""What the heck is going on and why should I care about it?"" you transition to the feeling of ""Now I really need to know what's going on!"" Getting past the confusion and finally investing in the characters is absolutely worth it to see everything unravel and piece back together in the end. ",0,oldest,"['must-read', 'read-in-2009']"

I am a sucker for braided narratives; they read like a mystery novel for me. This was a great one. I found myself jotting notes to try to figure out how the plot lines connected long before it was evident there was much of a connection. I think that once students get into it (it does take a while for some, although I was instantly hooked) they will feel the same and try to think about how it will fit as well.So, assuming that not all teens are as into that aspect as I am, why else would this appeal to students? The novel begins with a brutal accident, one that can't help but make you root for the children who were left behind. On the other hand, the book is full of the closest types of friendships forming... The kinds of friendships that become family, whether out of need (as is shown here) or just because everyone needs that kind of bond. High school students are beginning to experience that, and to see groups of peers so passionate about friendship is something everyone can relate to... even if it's just something they have always wanted.However, I quickly learned that not everyone was as invested in reading this book as I was. Many of my classmates found the first hundred or so pages to be very confusing and therefore lost interest. For this reason, I would only really recommend it to students who love to read already. In addition, the ""war"" seems really pointless. Yes, it is explained later in the novel, but it actually makes most reviews sound like it's a science fiction novel or something, and it isn't at all. I think that this plot device, and the scant purpose for it, would distract and annoy many readers.The biggest asset to the best young adult literature is a believable cast of characters, and Marchetta is a little bit hit-or-miss on this one. Some, such as Taylor & Hannah, are incredibly believable. On the other hand, because so little is really known about all of the older cast of characters (particularly Fritz and Jude), these sometimes come off as flat characters, barely more than cardboard stand-ins.To encourage students to read this novel, I would suggest it readily to those who are fans of John Green's Looking for Alaska. Like that already-popular novel, Jellicoe Road addresses boundaries (perhaps more literally) and finding oneself, as well as coping with losses and finding meaning in others. Additionally, the more I read, the more Narnie reminded me of Melinda Sorvino in Laurie Halse Anderson's novel Speak. I was relieved to see that like Melinda, Narnie pulled herself together when crisis dictated that need.",0,oldest,"['ztlib', 'young-adult', 'vomit-less-romance', 'great-ya', 'mental-illness']"

The hype was pretty impossible to live up to. But it's an incredibly well written book, full of complicated characters, with a story that will grip you before you ever figure out what's going on.(I ended up reading this in one sleepy go, trying to stay awake all night at the train station - turns out that when they say the train leaves at 11:20, they mean it.

At one time I began to write down the names of everyone to link them to lovers, friends and family members, so I could remain focus and solve the mystery for myself. Never at any point did I think Jessa’s father was the Hermit…Marchetta was very careful to throw my sent. I do have to admit my mouth did drop, when Marchetta described the love-making scenes, while I did not think they were written too graphically I was just surprised by the elaborate words of anger, and sadness mixed with love. I guess, I found it surprisingly accurate compared to other writings where it is so romantic and over-rated. I liked the fact Marchetta wrote so ‘Raw’ and organic. Because this book was so hard to get into, I would only recommend it to Teens or people who LOVE to read. There was just so much detail lost about the Territory Wars, I was confused for the first 100 pages.

Each Summer, the boarding school kids participate in territory wars with the Cadets (Summer camp attendees from the military academy in Sydney) and the Townies (kids from the local town.) The novel begins with a flash-back that grabs the reader’s attention immediately, however, when chapter 1 begins it is slightly disorienting and it takes a few pages for the reader to orient themselves in the world of Taylor. There is a mystery embedded in the narrative that may initially cause confusion among readers, but those who stick with the storyline will be highly rewarded.

Almost all the adults in this book are totally irresponsible. I do not believe for one instant that two of the adult figures would have kept Taylor so far at arms (or longer) length. That the school is set up as it is with so few authority figures or people in charge is bogus. And the daily responsibilities of these teens are somehow not even a little in the way of the other things going on in their lives. That said. The plotting and the structure of this book are so interesting. Looking at other reviews, most readers complain that the first 100 pages are confusing (I agree). I don't think that was an accident. It is amusing to me that so many readers are so put off by that.

However, it was definitely a bit confusing switching from one to the next. There were also a lot of characters and with the different plot lines I was lost half the time.

I did like the ending of this book, but don't want to give it away so I'll just say it was very appropriate. The biggest appeal of Jellicoe Road lies in the settings, both past and present, and the vivid description of Jellicoe Road.I think this book may be a bit difficult for young adults, but who am I to say a child cannot handle a book? It just depends what each teen likes in books and if they can follow a confusing book, then I would recommend it to them! The characters are believable, but there are just so many of them to sort out. I would promote this book to teens when doing a unit on Australia. It is a rather historical book that mentions many cities and towns of Australia.

A few months later, I decided to give it another chance and I’m glad I did. This time I was enchanted by Taylor Markham and the almost magical outback world she inhabits. Marchetta has beautifully interwoven the scattered stories of Narnie, et al. with Taylor’s present, creating a subtle, but increasingly urgent, mystery for both Taylor and the reader. Clues dropped earlier in the novel don’t become apparent until the end when all the dialogue, memories, and interactions of the characters come together. In Jellicoe and its environs, she has created a tremendous sense of place that grounds the story and becomes its own character of sorts. The territory wars between the students, the townies, and the cadets reinforce the importance of place in the book.

Marchetta is a master at spooling out details, things that seem insignificant, until they suddenly become very important. She does this in such a way that although you may not take very much notice of this or that small detail, when the revelations come, you remember what came before very clearly - so that the process of piecing these stories together isn't a strain on your memory or patience. Marchetta has always been one of my favorite authors in terms of what she understands about teenage girls, and she manages to get humor, sorrow,love, action, romance, and mystery all packed in, without being melodramatic or overbearing.Please, please give this book a chance - you'll be well rewarded if you stick it out.",0,oldest,[]

The book deals with the following developmental markers: surviving on your own/becoming independent, reconciling with your past, developing positive adult relationships, forgiveness, and understanding. I thought that the characters were believable. Taylor really appealed to me and drew me into the story. I wanted her to do well and succeed. I also liked the relationships amongst the characters; I thought they were realistic and believable. I was a bit doubtful that there would really be “territory wars” as described in the book, but upon understanding the history behind their creation, I can see how that would really happen too. In a sense, Taylor’s experiences could be a representation for the types of conflict that occur on a much larger scale around the world. I would promote this book in conjunction with other similarly themed novels: The Outsiders, Miracle’s Boys, or Westside Story, etc. I think that describing the basic plot and the way in which Marchetta has established the plot structure would be enough to entice a reader to want to pick the book up.

But slowly - very slowly - the mysteries and romance and action of the story reveal themselves. For this reason I think many teens, without direction, will give up on it. It takes a sophisticated reader. It would help the reader simply to know that the pages in italics are from a book that one of the main characters is writing, and that the pages in regular font are from the present. Marchetta is clearly the master of the slow, careful reveal. I was literally gasping out loud by the end of the book as everything came together. And talk about loving and investing in characters! Wow! You love them all by the end, flaws and all - Taylor, Jonah, Raffaela, Santangelo, Jessa, Narnie, Tate, Webb, Fitz, and Jude. The writing and imagery are stunning as well. The book is set in Australia; therefore, there are some terms that American readers may struggle with - though most can be figured out from context (ie; singlet).The book is first and foremost about friendship and the love that binds true friends together.

I would recommend this book to a teen who might be struggling with family/roots problems since Taylor can remember very little of her mother and father and is the main reason she is kind of closed off to everyone she meets.

Taylor must now figure out how her past is linked with Hannah's and five children who attended the Jellicoe School before Taylor was born.Teens will like the depth of this book. It follows several story lines, which, while they may be confusing at first, all tie together at the end. Aspects of the work that may appeal to teens include the romance between Taylor and Jonas, a cadet who camps near the school, and the sense of adventure that fills the pages of Jellicoe Road.As Taylor pieces together they mystery of her past, she learns things about human nature that she will never forget.

The first chapter left me awestruck- it was an incredible beginning. However, the next 100 pages are comprised of two stories that swirl around one main character who frankly, is less than likable in the beginning. After the 200 page mark, it is apparent that the structure emulates the main character's confusion- the reader is already beginning to piece together what the main character is beginning to suspect. It is tedious work, but the payoff is worth it- once the story picks up and the characters begin to interact, the story is quite enjoyable. I took off one star for two reasons. One is due to editing. I felt that structurally, the reader could relate to the main story of Jellicoe Road, but the reader never really relates to the secondary story. With as many pages and development allocated by the writer, there should have been more development or in my opinion, less of the secondary story except in the development of the main story (I'm trying to write this without spoiling anything here). There are also some basic mistakes, as noted in other reviews- the ethnicity of one character contradicts itself, there are unexplained lapses in time during scenes, and so on.Finally, this is supposed to be an award-winning book, with an emphasis on literary achievement. While Jellicoe Road does not lack this, I personally see this book as having a rather limited teen audience. I work in a public library, and there is a certain type of teen who would be willing to put in the effort to navigate the complexities of this novel- a novel that is sometimes overly complex and at times somewhat inaccessible. I worked through the first third of the book because it was a Printz winner, and I felt an obligation to finish it. I wonder if teens would do the same- it's not difficult, but it can be a chore. And who wants to make their leisure reading a chore? (This isn't me advocating Twilight for the Printz award, but really, let's take into account the audience of a book, and not just what adults/professionals think).

It kept me up waaay past my bedtime last night. Marchetta's book--simply titled Jellicoe Road on my hardcover--recently won the Printz Award for best Young Adult book of 2008, so I read it to see why. The story that starts the book, about kids who lose their parents in a terrible car accident and bond with their rescuer, another kid, plus a second new friend, turns out to be a kind of framing device, or maybe a prequel, woven through the current story of Taylor Markham. Taylor lives at the Jellicoe School, and she's the new leader of the school crowd. Together with two other groups--the Townies and the Cadets--the teens fight silent, sometimes vicious battles for territory, all without any of the adults knowing. But mysteries abound: Why has kind neighbor Hannah disappeared? Is the Brigadier a hero or a villain? What did the Hermit say to Taylor right before he killed himself? What happened to Webb? And why did Cadet leader Jonah Griggs call the school after he and Taylor ran away three years ago? Most important, who is Taylor Markham, and can she overcome her own darkness, let alone the darkness of the territory wars? The unwinding of all these mysteries makes for a painfully rich read. If I take a big step back, I might say that all of the tangled subplots in Jellicoe Road are kind of melodramatic. But I can't take that step back, and I don't want to--I'm too busy caring about Taylor and her friends.

After reading and hearing accolades about this book, I'm so thrilled to say that I loved it. So beautiful, strange, and heart-wrenching. Excellent teen literature and one of the best books I've read in awhile. Taylor Markham is 11 years old when her mother leaves her at a 7-11 on Jellicoe Road in rural Australia and Hannah finds her. Now 17, she's in her last year at the local boarding school, where Hannah is her house's mentor and the closest thing she has had to a mother. The territory wars between her school, the Cadets, and the Townies are about to begin, and the seniors will be choosing a new leader for Jellicoe School. Hardened by her mother's abandonment and her hidden yearning to belong, Taylor is not the popular choice but is chosen nonetheless. But when Hannah disappears and Jonah Griggs, now cadet leader, reenters her life, Taylor is forced to face her mysterious past and her buried emotions if she wants to have a say in her future.  That synopsis only skims the surface of this complex and multi-faceted novel. There's so much more which is best left to be anticipated. I don't think any summary of Jellicoe Road and its unique premise can really do it justice without including spoilers. I came into it knowing that it may be confusing and hard to sink your teeth into. But being aware of this only made it seem less cumbersome and more promising because I had so much faith that the slow, gradual build-up would be worth it. I did need to re-read several passages as I went along and I know that I still missed some dropped hints, but it was more than worth it. I was awestruck at how the seemingly disparate narrative pieces and disconnected cast of characters all subtly fell into place at the turn of each page until the very last. I'll have to take back some of the times I've said this or that book had a perfect ending, because this one was truly perfect in the way it ties up the story and rewards its reader. I cried and relished it. As a side note writers take note: Marchetta's prologue and epilogue are stellar. I will with pleasure be re-reading this book. ",3,oldest,['young-adult']

In the past they have chosen some truly aMAZing books (like ""The White Darkness"" or ""Looking for Alaska"") some not so much my favorites but still, they always choose books just a little bit different, which is what I really like. Each book tends to deal with difficult issues surrounding teens that take my breath away and never fail to get me thinking. 2009's choice is no light-weight either. I've actually had ""Jellicoe Road"" in my TBR pile for several months now and just haven't had a chance to pick it up. Now that I've finished it, I'm just kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School, where many of the students, like her, are orphans or have been abandoned by their parents. Taylor was brought to Jellicoe School by the mysterious Hannah after her mom left her at a 7-11 when she was 11. Each year, the students fight the Cadets, who camp near the school for several weeks and the Townies in a type of territory 'war' that determines control over various trails, streams and buildings in the bush. This year, Taylor has been selected as the school's leader and is more than reticent to participate. Then Hannah unexpectedly disappears and Taylor knows it's connected to the disappearance of her mother and will stop at nothing to find out more. Joined by other students, the mysterious Cadet leader Jonah Griggs, and the Townie Santangelo, Taylor slowly unravels the story of her past and the stories of those she loves most.To be competely honest, for the first part of the book I was pretty lost. There are several storylines and everyone seemed to have 'history' which made for some confusing reading. But knowing how many people have raved about it, I just kept reading hoping to make sense of it all. And it did. Taylor's story came together with such unexpected beauty that I found myself totally intrigued by each new revelation and it's effect on Taylor and her friends. That's not to say I missed some things along the way - I actually had to reread several parts after finishing becuase I totally missed one major revelation. Oops. But I can't say enough good about this book: there is such heartbreaking sadness, wonder and hope found here that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

This novel is utterly confusing until you get deep into the plot. Once you really realize that there are two stories being told, Taylor's story of her the time when she meets Jonah and forms a deep relationship, and the second is the story of Webb, Tate, Narnie, Fitz and Jude whose lives are interwoven following a tragic accident on Jellicoe Road. What makes the story difficult to follow is the fact that it isn't written in a chronilogical format. The reader, if in a classroom setting, might benefit from keeping notes on the characters or a timeline of events in each character's life. I didn't realize until late in the story that Taylor would meet her mother again, which is the perfect ending to the most confusing story I've read. Making a family tree visual prior to reading in the classroom, would offer meaning for the reader of the families and the conflict that exists. Marchetta deals with so many themes, it will be a long study for the class who takes on this book. The students or the reader will be forced to think about family relationships and roles. The reader will see many examples of friendships, both good and bad, which will lead to issues of loyalty. I also wanted to know more about the parents of these children. What parenting roles are to be modeled or emulated and what parental roles would we like to broach and forget? Children are often forced, too soon, to deal with the harshness life can offer with death's grief and with the possibility of abandonment by parents for whatever reasons. This would be an incredible book to use in order to study relationships. I would have to recommend that the teacher read it several times so as not to miss the many messages twisted into the plot and to be able to guide the reader through the issues creatively. Not an easy read is Jellicoe Road, but a most challenging and interesting one. Still, it is not one I would just pick up for pleasure, I would have to have encouragement or pressure if I were a student today. These are relevant topics in the game of life that all adolescents should embrace. This book may be very difficult for the suffering kid. It wouldn't be possible for the struggling reader.5Q 3P S",0,oldest,['printz-award-books']

The skirmishing is artificial and thus takes way too much effort to maintain - so the blossoming friendships between the groups take center stage, as does the mysterious connection between a tragic event 20 years ago and main character Taylor, a girl with a big chip on her shoulder.

While she can be assertive and brash, she is also often sullen and withdrawn. She has just been appointed leader of her school's campaign in the annual ""Territory Wars"" between the Jellicoe School, the Townies who go to school in town, and the Cadets, whose military school camps out in the bush near the Jellicoe Road to do training exercises. The Territory Wars are kind of a hassle, really, but they can't be dismissed, for they determine who can go where, and they're a tradition that dates back quite a while. It's all quite stressful for Taylor. It just so happens that the one adult she trusts--the one adult who cares for her, who found her after she had been abandoned by her mother, and who brought her to the Jellicoe School in the first place--just disappears one day, and does not leave Taylor with any readon for why she's left Jellicoe nor where she's gone. So Taylor is in a rather unsettled state, a state not particularly conducive to leading her school in the Territory Wars nor negotiating with the leaders of the Townies and Cadets.The Territory Wars are all quite interesting, and they seem uniquely Australian, or maybe they're just unique, but ultimately the book is not about them. Taylor, who knows very little about her past (and what she does know is repressed), starts to piece together a narrative that explains who her parents were, how she came to be abandoned, and the backstory which led to the creation of the Territory Wars. This is a fantastic book. There's a lot of tragedy in this story. But ultimately there's a lot of love, too. Reading this book will make you appreciate your family just a little bit more than you already do. You'll want to go back and look at photos of your parents when they were teenagers. You'll think about all your relatives' stories about their adventures growing up. I loved this book. Terrific writing and terrific story.

While I still felt it took too long to feel attached to the characters, the story did eventually draw me in. I enjoyed the parallels that are drawn between Taylor and her group of friends (which includes Jellicoe students, Townies, and a Cadet) and Taylor's parents and their group of friends (which included Jellicoe students, a Townie, and a Cadet) and how Taylor learned about her family's history. A well-constructed plot and intriguing conflicts make for a compelling story, but the slow build-up is likely to make this a tough sell for most teens.---------INITIAL REVIEW FROM MARCH 2009:Okay... to be honest, I didn't finish this book. I didn't even get past Chapter 6. But I tried to WANT to read it for almost two weeks before finally giving up today. I'm sure the Printz Award Committee had their reasons for selecting it for this year's winner, but I just couldn't get into the story. I didn't feel any connection to the main character, or any of the characters really, and I wasn't even really intrigued by the ""mystery"" of how the territory wars began. I tried. I really did.

The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.-------------------------------With a beginning like that, how could you put it down? Well, I did, two times, but the third time…well…wow. Every once in awhile, a book comes along that just hits you in the gut. It hits too close to home, it tears your heart out, it grabs you by the roots of your hair and spins and doesn’t turn loose until well after the last page has been turned. Jellicoe Road did all these things to me and so much more.Taylor Markham has been living at the Jellicoe Road boarding school since her mother abandoned her at the nearby 7-Eleven six years earlier. She doesn’t really know what happened to her father; only that he has been gone for most of her life. Now she’s seventeen has been newly elected to the post of student leader of her dorm and to lead the Underground Community as one of the three boarding schools who battle for territory (among other things) in her small Australian community. The two other gangs are called the Cadets and the Townies. For years these three camps have fought in the “Territory Wars;” wars fought over land, trees, water, and more. Everything is going swimmingly, until Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family disappears without a word. Jonah Griggs, the boy Taylor ran away with three years ago and the leader of the Cadets has popped back into her life with smoldering looks and mystifying behavior. And all the young kids of Taylor’s house are now looking to her for everything. Things start falling apart.Understandably Taylor wants to know what’s going on with Hannah. We are given glimpses of a novel that Hannah has been working on, which at first Taylor takes to be fictional but quickly realizes that it might not be so fictional. It provides an all important glimpse of Hannah’s, and Taylor’s, life. As she gets closer and closer to the truth the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and, well, good luck putting the book down. This is an absorbing story where nothing is quite what it seems and the clues only lead to more questions for Taylor, as she tries to work out the connections between herself, Hannah, her mother and the character’s in Hannah’s book. This is a book about secrets, anguish, pain, love, betrayal, hope, death, life and oh so much more. It’s heartbreaking and beautiful. It’s gorgeous and haunting. It’s going to live with me for a long time, I’m sure. I’m so glad I gave it that third try.Oh and this is important. Jellicoe Road won the Printz Award!",0,oldest,"['2009', 'fiction', 'young-adult']"

There are two different sets of characters, one group from the past, and a contemporary one, with no clues as to how they fit together, complicated by the fact that the characters' names are Australian and not obvious (at least to this American) which ones belong to boys, and which ones to girls. You learn right off that there was a car accident that brought five kids together in the past, and that there's a girl named Taylor trying to figure out what they have to do with her now. Fortunately, the plot is strong enough and rewarding enough to be worth it. I got to the end, and just as many other reviewers have said, immediately started again from the beginning.The main character is Taylor, a GIRL, and a student at the boarding school on Jellicoe Road. She's almost an orphan, and lives there year-round, since her mother left her at the age of nine. But Taylor knows there's a lot about her mother's life she doesn't know, and the READER knows it must have something to do with that other timeline. The hard part, the part that takes patience, is reading far enough into the book to find out how.In the meantime, the students of the boarding school are in a complicated wargame they play every year, with the townies and the cadets over territory, that is both fascinating and amusing. Adding to the fun, the intimidating leader of the cadets has a history with Taylor, leader of the students, and the leader of the townies has a history with Taylor's second in command, Raffaela. Oh! And there's a serial killer of kids lurking in the background of the story, too. Listen, just GO with it.

It’s also the most rewarding. After being held hostage by the king of all hooks in the prologue (“My father took 132 minutes to die. I counted...”), I expected the plot to unfold quickly thereafter. Instead, the mysterious plot slowly inched forward by cleverly moving backward. This story shares the lives of a group of downtrodden, neglected teenagers – many wards of the state – attending the Jellicoe School out in the “boondocks.” Since so few have parents in their lives, they come to depend highly on one another. Teenagers in the town have created territories and proclaimed war against opposing groups. In addition to dealing with territory disputes, seized hostages and keeping the girls of her house safe, Taylor Markham is struggling to contain the demons of her miserable past, unstable present and unpredictable future. At seemingly every turn, she finds battles to fight, drama to tame and an unlikely romance to decipher. But Taylor’s biggest distraction is trying to solve the painful mysteries of her past. Melina Marchetta has written an absolute masterpiece. Appreciating this story requires an extremely patient reader who is willing to reread confusing parts several times over. Marchetta challenges her readers to make higher-level connections most authors wouldn’t dare try in fear of losing their readers too soon. You may find yourself completely lost 200 and even 300 pages into this story but stick it out to the end. The book is like a puzzle with 419 pieces. Each piece of the page (i.e., each page) must be carefully considered and pieced together in the correct context in order to be fully understood. As you make it toward the end of the book, you will recall scenes throughout the story that previously had you wondering, “What in the world is going on?” and you will say aloud, “Oooohhh!! I get it now. WOW!” When, late in the story, the author began dropping subtle clues to make sense of earlier scenes, my eyes continually widened and my jaw constantly dropped - and my heart even pounded at times! Once completed, you will experience a moving story that will force you to break out the tissues and to applaud Marchetta’s brilliant storytelling. Jellicoe Road is oftentimes devastating, sometimes humorous and steadily mysterious. It is an intricate, complicated story that could easily be used as part of a college-level literature course. I decided to read the book because I came across Jellicoe Road as I was trying to find good books to read on Goodreads. I noticed Jellicoe Road scored a high rating on Goodreads, so I gave it a try. While a select handful of 8th graders might be able to tackle and interpret this story, I would recommend this story mainly for advanced avid readers, high school and above.

She does not know much about her past and only has a few scattered memories of her early childhood. When she was eleven, her mother abandoned her at a gas station and a woman who lives next to her school picked her up and brought her to the school. Taylor knows that Hannah has some connection to her past, and worries when she disappears without letting Taylor know where she is going or when she will be back. While Taylor worries about her mysterious past and Hannah’s location, she is also supposed to be leading her school in the annual territory wars between the townies and visiting cadets. She is also perplexed by unsettling dreams and a story about five friends who used to go to her school. Can Taylor figure out her past and not let her school down? Or will she cave under the stress?Like many people have said, this book begins slowly, but picks up as the novel progresses and the storylines start coming together. I think that the characters and plot could be appealing to some teens, particularly those who like a challenge and appreciate lots of description.

Our heroine Taylor is tough, a bit prickly, and yet vulnerable. Honestly, what kept me going was the mystery surrounding her intense relationship with her should-be enemy, Jonah Griggs. I found the side-plot/interruptions by Hannah's writing to be a tad annoying and yet compelling. I kept forgetting the second story's characters, and when I was just wanting to read about Taylor, the damn second plot would interrupt.

Apparently I started reading this 22 days ago. That's when I read the first two chapters and thought ""Nope, can't do this"" and shifted it aside to stare at for three weeks. I came back, but with a grumble.It's frustrating and purposely ambiguous for at least 200 pages; the confusing doesn't go away and only lets up enough to give you a few clues. No one ever explains what's going on* and it's set in an unrealistic and unbelievable high school situation (""wars"" for territory of trails, buildings, etc between townies, cadets, and the leader of the six houses of a boarding school which in itself seems unlikely and unrealistic) where no one goes to class. Even by the end, you know you need to reread it all to fully get what happened. So, in other words, a perfect candidate for a Printz, no?*Which yes, I get, is the point since Taylor has no damn clue herself but a little background would have made a difference.I didn't like the bits between chapters, even after I figured out what they were and that I shouldn't have been skimming them. Sometimes in a book, these sorts of breaks are nice but here they caused an ugh! and a flipping to see how many pages I had to get through.BUT - and this is an all caps worthy but - by the end, I really liked it.Here's the thing: I was mad at the book but I wanted to keep reading. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but you'll reach a shift where you stop reading just to plow through and start reading because you don't want to put it down. You've just got to be willing to stick with it long enough to make that happen.The massive mystery unwinds slowly but, and you've got to trust me here, it's worth it. There's a large cast of characters to keep track of, but (again after 200 pages) Taylor, Griggs, Raffaela, and Santangelo pull away and you don't feel so lost. Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that while the reading experience is having lots of pieces thrown at you, Marchetta's a good enough writer to hold it all together. A note on stars / recommendation / ages:Firmly between 4-5 stars, if you keep reading. I'd happily reread the second half, no doubtRecommendations are tough. It's worth recommendations but not for all patron and maybe a ""stick with it"" kind of comment should be included.Also - the Horn Book said 12-14. Roger Sutton, I adore you, but you're crazy. I can't imagine that's where most readers will fall. I'd say 10th on up--not because it's inappropriate for middle school (albeit dark at times in plot and topics) but because it's a text that requires some work and effort to get through. Plus, the main characters (one set, anyway) are for all practical purposes hs seniors.  ",0,oldest,"['ya', 'mystery-suspense', 'z_09']"

It takes a long time to understand what this story is all about. It is worth it by the end, and I am glad I read this. Two families have a head on collision on the highway. Their lives then become tangled and intwined for years and several generations. Life isn't easy for any of them and in the end they realize that they have needed eachother all along. The characters realize they are dependant on one another to survive and care about each other. The kids have been spared from the history and details to try to spare them from the agony of hurt and loss. The kids then have a sense of loss and mystery. They try to find out as much as they can on their own. By banding together in their loss and craziness at the house and camp for wayward boys and girls, who don't have a home, on Jellicoe road, they develop friendships that will last a lifetime. The girls are there year round. The boys only come in for summer camp across the river. The kids have had a tradition of territory wars. This was developed as a way to interact and have fun together. The kids create some close relationships that make me wish I could have experienced all the fun. The kids are recovering from horrible experiences but they come together to create a hope and love. What a beautiful story. VOYA quality is a 5. VOYA popularity 3. I don't think many kids will stick through this book long enough to make it to the good part. The kids in this story were able to give eachother some of the development assets that they need to become a healty adult. Most of the family life missing for the kids was given to them by the relationships they formed with each other. The kids were able to go to a place where solid rules were in place. The camp rules were strict and the territory rules were also very strict and thorough. Many times the older kids were expected to care for the younger ones.

It creates a sort of mystery-feeling that helps move the story along, and there are a couple spots that need the push to get past the angsty-teenager pages. I see that in this book as well as the author's previous books that most of the problems for her teenage protagonists, the thing that sends them over the edge and makes all the adults suddenly worry and pay attention, is that they aren't told all the information. The adults around them, trying to ""protect them,"" hide information. The teenagers want the answers, especially this character who doesn't know who she is or where she came from. And when you're at an age where you're trying to define who you are, not knowing is a big deal.

Taylor ran away from school 3 years ago when she was 14 (with one of the Cadets – Jonah Griggs) to try and find her mother who abandoned her at a 7-11 when she was just a little girl. Taylor’s been wondering about her family and her past for as long as she can remember, and this year things come to a head when her guardian, Hannah, disappears for several weeks to take care of some “personal” business, and leaves Taylor alone and frustrated. Taylor and the leaders of the Cadets and Townies become close friends, as the leaders once were back when the territory wars started. And it’s Jonah, again, who accompanies Taylor when she sets off – this time to track down Hannah – in search of the truth.This is really two stories woven together - Hannah’s story about her past, and Taylor’s story about her present. They’re remarkably similar – with young people who come to be friends and then more than friends, who invent and play a game just so they can spend more time together, and who have a shared history. In Hannah’s story, however, there’s a terrible tragedy that affects the lives of all the others and continues to have effects years later. It’s what makes Taylor’s mom turn to drugs so she can forget, what makes her abandon Taylor, what makes Hannah keep a distance from the people she loves, and what eventually brings the survivors back together again. This is all about the friendships forged and the unraveling mystery of Taylor’s and Hannah’s past. I really like Melina Marchetta’s writing, she creates realistic characters and situations and stories with depth.

There are so many things going on in this book it was hard to keep them straight. There is Taylor Markham, abandoned by her mother when she was 11, her father has never been around and she doesn't know why, her guardian Hannah has left town without telling her, a boy from her past is back in town and getting under her skin. Then there are the territory wars between the townies, the cadets and the students of the Jellico school, a boarding school of which she is their reluctant leader.And then there is the back story which pops up intermitently throughout the book about 5 kids who lived on the Jellicoe Road over 20 years ago, 3 of whom were involved in a terrible accident that killed 5 people. This part confused me at first because I could not figure out how the story of those 5 kids had any relevance at all to the present situation and I kept feeling like I was missing some crucial plot element, but when the pieces start to fall together like pieces in a puzzle it is so worth the wait. Each detail of this story has some relevance and each piece that falls into place is like a revelation. Once things start to come together I had a hard time putting it down and am still thinking about even now.Ultimately this is a book about a girl who is desperate to put together the pieces of her past and find where she belongs. It is a heartbreaking story and yet it is also one of hope and love.There are definitely undertones of some mature subject matter; death, drug addiction, abuse, suicide, and a brief sex scene so I would not recommend it to younger readers or anyone really who would be bothered by that, but definitely a story that made an impression on me.",0,oldest,[]

Failing that, I was certain that after nabbing a National Book Award, What I Saw and How I Lied (2008) would take a Printz award/honor.You can therefore imagine my surprise when it was neither of my predicted titles but Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road* (2008**) that won the 2009 Printz Award for excellence in young adult literature. Being a fan of Marchetta's previous novels Looking for Alibrandi (1992) and especially Saving Francesca (2005) you can also imagine my embarrassment upon realizing one of my favorite authors had published a new book without my realizing it.The only solution, of course, was to immediately procure a copy from the library and read it as soon as possible.Jellicoe Road is not a novel with one protagonist. Rather, it has many. The story starts on the Jellicoe Road with a tragic accident that will have far reaching repercussions for each character in the novel. Then, abruptly, the story starts again twenty-two years later at the Jellicoe School--the boarding school located farther down the same road--when Taylor Markham is chosen to lead the school's faction in a secret territory war that has spanned a generation between the school boarders, the Townies, and the Cadets.The Jellicoe School is the only real home Taylor has ever known. She has been at the school since she was eleven, when her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road and Hannah drove by to pick Taylor up and take her to the school. Now seventeen, Taylor is in many ways still a young girl afraid of being abandoned by those she loves. Which is why, at the start of the story, Taylor balks at the authority thrust upon her and the relationships it will necessitate. Leading the Jellicoe School through the territory wars is bad enough, but being in charge of an entire dorm of students seems truly unbearable. Taylor's resolve to live a life apart is tested, and in many ways broken, with the efforts of well-meaning friends and the appearance of Jonah Griggs--the one person Taylor never expected to see, or need, ever again.As the territory wars escalate, Taylor's life is thrown into disarray with the sudden disappearance of Hannah--the only adult Taylor would come close to calling family. With Hannah gone, Taylor begins reading Hannah's unfinished novel for lack of anything else to cling to. Marchetta weaves Taylor's story and the events of Hannah's novel and even the histories of other characters together to create one haunting narrative where, the more Taylor reads, the more it feels like she is looking not at fictitious characters but at people she has known her entire life.While trying to understand Hannah's sudden absence, Taylor also starts to understand herself. Eventually she realizes that living life at a distance offers no protection from abandonment and provides even fewer options to heal scars from past betrayals.The novel starts with rapid fire narration as Taylor throws out events and names at the reader without any frame of reference. Later in the story the importance of the Cadet, the Hermit, and the Brigadier becomes painfully obvious. But in the first pages the narrative comes closer to painfully confusing and unwieldy. By the end of my reading I had a marker at almost every page to indicated important points and favorite passages. However, if you can roll with the uncertainty, you will be rewarded. At a little over four hundred pages, Marchetta still creates a page-turner that moves quickly and weaves together every single narrative thread by the final page.Because Taylor is not forthcoming with explanations, the novel reads like a mystery (fitting since my two Printz Award predictions were also mysteries of sorts). However a good portion of the story is also simply about friendship and love. Taylor expects neither from her time on the Jellicoe Road even though they might be exactly what she was supposed to find there all along. Marchetta blends moments of humor and gravitas in her unique prose style to create another really great read.* Jellicoe Road was actually originally published, I assume in Marchetta's native Australia, with the title On the Jellicoe Road. For various reasons, upon finishing the novel, I feel that this title is superior to the American edition's shortened version.** The book was originally published, again I assume in Australia, in 2006.*** In addition to the original title being superior, in terms of relevance to the story, the original cover art is also much more apt. (Although I just realized the US cover has a Poppy on it which I will grudgingly admit is actually pretty relevant to the story. It also makes it impossible to pick a cover to feature here so, readers, you get both.)",0,oldest,['owned']

And I was never really frustrated with the book, but I was confused. Especially at the beginning. The book starts out very much like a puzzle and I enjoyed putting the pieces together. There were a few things I had issues with : one, Taylor is hinted at being an unreliable narrator a few times, but it didn't really become an issue in the telling of the story - it wasn't a Catcher in the Rye kind of unreliable narrator sort of situation, but there were a few discrepancies between her story and the stories put forth by other characters. Might have just been me getting my panties in a bunch over nothing. The other thing (and this might be a big thing for some readers) is that I put the pieces together too soon. Before the narrator. In some cases many many pages before the narrator. While I do pride myself on being an expert reader, this bugs me. I feel like I shouldn't know something WAY before the main character does. I should maybe think...could that be? nah, there would have been more hints....not Oh I get it now. Wait....she doesn't? Seriously? So yeah. Other than those two points, I really liked this book.

The second half really picked up, and the story started to make a bit of sense and finally at the end, the reward was well worth the wait.If I could rate the book in parts, I'd give the first half about three stars, the next quarter four stars, and the end four and a half to five. I guess that with all the confusion at the beginning, I wasn't AS caught up in the story as I could have been so the payoff at the end wasn't a solid five even though I did really enjoy it.I love stories that weave themselves together, making unrelated strands all have a clear place in the tale by the end. Holes is another really enjoyable example.I'd definitely read more of Melina Marchetta.

Once the book started to pick up steam (I found the early chapters on the battle between the Townies, Cadets, and Jellicoe students kind of tedious) I was thoroughly hooked into the story and just started weeping when I reached the end, partly because the last 100 pages are truly beautiful, and partly because I was really sad to see the story end.",0,oldest,['ya-books']

Printz Award. Taylor Markham is the main character in this novel filled with mystery, emotion, tragedy, and love. Taylor must solve the puzzle of her past, and make the necessary connections to the present, in order to ensure her future. All the while she is coping with being head of her boarding school dorm, and finds herself representing her school in the territorial war with the Townies and the Cadets. Further complications ensue when she discovers that the Cadets are lead by Jonah Griggs, another part of her past she can’t seem to leave behind. The truth all comes to light on the Jellicoe Road, “the prettiest road I’ve ever seen…”. Developmentally the book delves into teenage peer relationships, the importance of family and one’s past, and the ultimate need for love and to belong (versus abandonment, etc.). The book is full of mystery, adventure, and surprising twists and turns that have definite young adult appeal. The only problem is that the novel is quite confusing in the beginning, going between Taylor in the present and Hannah’s manuscript of the past. I must admit that it is difficult to get into the novel initially, and I’m not sure if young adults will read far enough into the story to get hooked. I would promote the book with other award winners, taking the opportunity to educate teens on the various awards and honors available to young adult literature.",0,oldest,[]

So exquisitely painful. And beautifully hopeful. And achingly sad. I couldn't put it down. And now I'll need to read something absolutely mindless and fluffy and stupid in an attempt to get certain images out of my head long enough for me to sleep.

It's sort of painful right now and I am considering ditching it. Someone, tell me if I should keep going.Ok so now I'm done and although I can't say anything negative about it (interesting characters, exciting and surprising plot, original setting) I just wasn't wowed personally. I think it was all the territory wars, which I tried really hard to care about since it made sense to me why territory was so important to these kids, but I just couldn't care enough. It's akin to how I feel about the game Risk. I appreciate the game and understand why it's so popular, but do I want to play? Not really.I will be recommending this book a lot, though.

Jellicoe Road has it all- I cried, I laughed, I cried some more.
