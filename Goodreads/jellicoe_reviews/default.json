But it was worth it.Melina Marchetta never fails to remind me why she is one of my favourite authors and, in my opinion, this is the best of her books I've read so far. It's very difficult to put into words how I feel about On the Jellicoe Road. All I can say is that my heart has been ripped out and shredded, my throat has sealed up with emotion, and when I finally get some sleep, I get the feeling I'll probably dream about Jonah Griggs.The story is of Taylor Markham, a girl who was abandoned by her mother as a young child and now resides in a boarding school for kids who are troubled, neglected or criminally inclined. Her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. Taylor tries to balance this responsibility with her own worries about Hannah's sudden disappearance and her belief that it is connected to her mother. On top of that, there's her relationship with Jonah Griggs, one of the Cadets and a boy from her past, who knows her a little too much for comfort.This is so much more than a typical YA book. I want to tell everyone to read this, scream praise from the rooftops, and glare with disapproval at the teens in my local library until they drop Halo and pick up these fantastic works of fiction. Saving Francesca, The Piper's Son, On the Jellicoe Road... every book I read seems better than the last. She creates moods that permeate the entire book so even the most simplistic scenes or conversations become deeply emotional, and Melina Marchetta plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. I can't think of a single book that has had me choked up more than this one.And Jonah Griggs, you stole my heart. Though I do think Melina Marchetta could quite easily persuade me to fall in love with a goldfish. Basically this book is everything... beautiful, powerful, tragic without being melodramatic, and I know this wonderfully sad story will stay with me for a very long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube", "num_likes": 412, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult", "2011", "contemporary"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/160627349", "review_id": "160627349", "date": "Apr 12, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lora", "user_url": "/user/show/4632071-lora", "text": "There's a reason why books like Twilight don't receive those. They don't give those to just any book, and when you factor in excellence . . . well, a lot of titles just don't make the cut. But it is clear to me why Melina Marchetta's third tribute to YA literature received a Printz award back in 2009. It is because it is excellent, to the very meaning of the word.If all YA contemporary writers wrote like Marchetta, I doubt I'd play in any other genre playground very often. She writes these beautifully inspirational, relatable, and emotionally-charged novels that seem to affect me in an undescribable way. Some of the passages in Jellicoe Road seem to beat with their own heart:\"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\"\"'What do you want from me?' he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\"I've always believed that an exceptionally good writer can take you places emotionally that others can't, and, for me, Melina Marchetta is one of those writers. I'm going to end this review here for two reasons: 1) I believe this is the type of book that should be experienced first hand, without much knowledge of the story going in. So, go read it and remember, the beginning is confusing, but plow through it and I promise you won't regret it; 2) I'm tearing up thinking about this story and its characters, so all you'll be getting from me is the aforesaid and this: I love this book and I'm anticipating the day when I can read it again.

But not every will love this book. I will also preface this review by saying that you shouldn't decide whether you belong in group A or group B before you get to page 125 or so. The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial \"wars\" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

Gorgeous*Books like this make me realize just how insignificant words become when attempting to convey raw emotion. On the Jellicoe Road is more than just a book; it is a hauntingly beautiful journey towards an unexpected destination where tragedy and despair become the bridges to the greatest of friendships.\u00a0\n\nAnd life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.\n\nThis story is told in alternating perspectives set in both past and present which, at first, seem entirely unrelated. But as the mysteries of this plot unravel, they begin to show hints of their glorious connection. If you find yourself confused or frustrated at first, don't give up - you are strategically been fed only pieces to a larger puzzle that will all fit together nicely in the end.\u00a0The character development in this story is extraordinary; no one is denied the sweetness of redemption and transformation. Seventeen year old Taylor Markham has been living on the Jellicoe Road after being abandoned by her mother at a local 7-11. The school she attends partakes in traditional games of territory wars where Taylor eventually becomes a leader. Taylor is tormented by the grief and uncertainty of her abandonment and keeps herself emotionally distant from others. She has few memories of her childhood, but when her history starts presenting itself she begins a relentless quest for answers.\u00a0The writing in this story is captivating as it flows methodically from one vivid scene to the next. Taylor's character, as broken as she appears, is actually quite funny in a dry and witty, sarcastic sense - which is my favorite type of humor. I appreciated being able to smile and laugh in the midst of such angst-ridden scenarios. Taylor's love interest, Jonah, is equally damaged and initially comes across as arrogant and crude. But, as their gentle relationship develops, it not only becomes one of the most loving but also one of the most inspiring.\u00a0\n\nBeing part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.\n\n Every single element and occurrence in this book is connected to some larger piece of the story. Everything. Most connections are prominent enough to take your breath away, but then there are those as subtle as whispers, and if you're not careful enough you just may miss them. I was still connecting the dots even after the book was done. The way this author seamlessly executes this perfect union of all that exists though past and present is truly astonishing.\u00a0Touching messages of hope, love, and determination tugged at me endlessly while reading this book. This story brought me to tears - from being just so deeply moved and so humbly inspired.\u00a0\n\n\"Hold my hand because I might disappear.\"\n\n\n\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Young Adult\u25aa\t Steam: Clean\u25aa Romance: Beautiful love story involved, but not sole focus. \u25aa\t Characters: Complex, well-developed, lovable. \u25aa\t Plot: Uniquely focused on tragic events forming powerful friendships.

Normally these are the books that either horrify me (Unwind, The Handmaid's Tale) or delight me with superb writing (The Queen of Attolia, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks) or awe me with imaginative world building (The Left Hand of Darkness) or make me cry (Before I Die). Jellicoe Road definitely falls into this last \"made-me-weep\" category.Jellicoe Road is the location of a boarding school for kids that are often neglected or with criminal tendencies. Taylor Markham is residing in the school because her mother had abandoned her at the age of 11 at a nearby 7-Eleven. Now Taylor is 17 and unexpectedly selected to be the school's leader in the game of territory wars with the Townies (locals from a tiny neighboring town) and Cadets (who spend several weeks a year in the Australian wilderness). Taylor is not sure she can handle the responsibility. She is uneasy more than ever - her mentor and friend Hannah disappears and Taylor is sure it has something to do with her mother; Jonah Griggs, a Cadet who she has a shared past with, is back and seems to know her all too well; she is plagued by dreams of a young boy who attempts to tell her something. What follows is Taylor's journey through the past and present to uncover the reasons why and how she was abandoned by her mother. As always, it is hard for me to explain what I like about a 5-star book, but I'll try. Melina Marchetta draws characters that are deep, complex, and real. The relationships among them are touching - more than anything I think, this book is about the power of friendship and, boy, there are some magnificent examples of friendship in this book! The book is also about grief, guilt, forgiveness and, of course, love.If I am forced to point out any flaws in this book, I'd say the writing some might find confusing in the beginning. It takes a few pages to figure out what is a dream and what is a page from a story Taylor is reading; what is from present and what is from the past. But soon enough all pieces of the puzzle fall together and you are faced with a deep, meaningful and heartbreaking story. Another thing that might bother readers is that some characters go through a lot of tragic events, sometimes too many. However, the story never becomes overly melodramatic or emotionally manipulative IMO. Jellicoe Road is a remarkable work of YA fiction and rightfully deserves the Printz award it was given in 2009.

After all of the glowing reviews for this one, I was prepared to be blown away. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way for me. It ended up being an \"okay\" story for me.My first problem has less to do with the actual story, and more to do with the format that I chose. I listened to the Audible edition and that was a big mistake. The problem didn't stem from the quality of narration, so much as the complexity of the story. There were simply too many moving parts for me to try and keep track of while listening to an audiobook. It is incredibly hard to pull off a book like this in audiobook format and it didn't work for me.I spent hours trying to figure out who the characters were and what the hell was going on. The transitions between characters and time frames was not always obvious, making matters even worse. I must have been hours into the story before I figured out that there were actually two stories playing out -- one in the present and one in the past. Needless to say, I lost a lot of time being utterly confused and unaware of what was going on. By the time I began to piece some things together, I had already missed so many of the \"connections\" and details that it was kind of pointless. When the big reveals came toward the end, they were kind of meaningless to me. I never really connected with the characters or the storyline. I had simply missed too much to play catch-up at that point.The story centers on Taylor Markham, a girl that was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road by her mother at the age of 11. She lives at a boarding school (orphanage???). When the lady that has taken care of her disappears, she is certain that something is amiss. Taylor sets out to find Hannah, or discover what really happened to her. When she runs across a book/journal written by Hannah, she begins to unveil some long-standing secrets. Along with some friends from her school, she has several creepy encounters and a variety of adventures. There is some sort of rivalry described between the two groups of kids...but I was pretty confused so I can't say I ever really grasped what that was about for sure.Overall, this ended up being a middle of the road story for me. I do suspect that I'm not doing this story justice though. I was just too lost for most of the book to take much away from the experience this time around. I do plan to re-read this in the future, because I have some lingering questions. I'm sure they were answered along the way and I just didn't catch it. I definitely won't be listening to the audiobook on my second attempt. This story will require my full attention.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com ", "num_likes": 150, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["childhood-loves", "listened-to-audio-version", "dark-themes", "forbidden-romance", "wtf-did-i-just-read", "shocking-twists"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/237145307", "review_id": "237145307", "date": "Nov 18, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Nataliya", "user_url": "/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "text": "\"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12 - Jesus, did you?\" This quote belongs to Stephen King, but it describes the soul of Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road perfectly.Jellicoe Road is the story of friendships that form your world, friendships so wonderful that it's easy to fall to pieces when they break. It is the story of abandonment and loss and learning to deal with it. It is the story of love, intense to the extreme with the generous helping of teen angst. In short, it is an excellent example of a good quality YA book, emotional, intense, and lyrical.\"I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\"Here's a short spoiler-free synopsis: Taylor Markham was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is now 17, living in Jellicoe School, a boarding school full of state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House (50 girls) and is expected to lead a sixteen-year-old 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids, the 'Townies' and the Cadets who camp out in the area for a couple of months each year. All while having strange dreams and feeling abandoned by her caretaker Hannah. All while reading Hannah's unfinished novel about five teenagers in the 1980s who form very intense friendship bonds after the horrific car accident on Jellicoe Road when they were 11-12 years old.Now, I have to say that not once did I look at this book as a mystery even though it's marketed as such. The central mystery of the story - well, I easily figured it out only a few chapters in, and the rest of the details easily came into light as the story developed. Not much took me by surprise; it was quite predictable, actually. But since the mystery was not why I enjoyed the story, the reading experience was perfectly fine. To use the book's own language, the whole mystery setup was not a trip but a journey. It was never about the resolution but about the emotional journey it took to get there.\"I remember asking, \"What is the difference between a trip and a journey?\" and my father said, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,\" and that was the last thing he ever said.\"What I loved was the friendships that the 'old five' and the 'new five' have developed throughout the course of their respective stories. My favorite by far was between Taylor and Raffaela, with the developing friendship with annoying but adorable Jessa as a close second. Even though there was a romantic story threatening to take the foreground, it never overshadowed the rest of the story and the friendships, and I'm thankful for that.\"This is the best night of my life,\" Raffy says, crying.\"Raffy, half our House has burnt down,\" I say wearily. \"We don't have a kitchen.\"\"Why do you always have to be so pessimistic?\" she asks. \"We can double up in our rooms and have a barbecue every night like the Cadets.\"Silently I vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of my life.\" I was quite emotionally affected (I'd say 'manipulated' if not for the negative connotation of that word) by the nostalgic atmosphere Marchetta creates here. The nostalgia for the beauty of childhood and adolescence, for the friendships of the kind that you can only have before you reach adulthood, for the safety of childhood (no matter how messed up it can be), for the safe haven of Jellicoe School for the lost and messed up children. I also loved Marchetta's excellent characterization. Her characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, and feel quite real. That is not to say that there's no stereotyping or clich\u00e9s, but those are kept to the minimum.\"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\"As for the voice of the novel - it is very emotional. Please be warned - it is emotional with the generous helping of teen angst. Oh, teen angst! It's on every page, in every sentence - just like it was so overwhelming when you were 16-17. Everything is intense, the tension is palpable, emotions are right on the surface. Reading this book is like experiencing being a teenager you once were. I found it to be a bit of eye-rolling experience initially (thankfully, I'm way out of the adolescence) but eventually the style grew on me and started to feel quite organic. But if you'd rather not deal with overexaggerrated raw teenage emotions - well, be warned and stay away from this story. \"What do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.\"------------------------------Now, here are the issues that I had with this book that forced me to knock off a star:- The Territory wars. I thought that storyline was limping on both feet. Why all the intensity if the whole thing only takes place for about 2 months each year? Why the whole issue with the Club House when it's only a few weeks when it becomes relevant? Honestly, just setting up a rivalry between the 'factions' would have been enough for the story. (view spoiler)[Especially since about halfway through the story any of that territory stuff becomes completely irrelevant as nobody pays any attention to it anymore (hide spoiler)].- Sometimes the emotional intensity slips into a blatant melodrama. I mean, there was actually a remark on (view spoiler)[how intense Taylor and Jonah's relationship was, which made me feel like I'm reading a Twilight-type love story (hide spoiler)].- The adults in this book (even Taylor remarks on it!). Seriously, what the hell is going on with the adults? (view spoiler)[Hannah and Jude, I'm looking at you! You and your minimal interference into the lives of the children of your best friends! And what's with keeping the parentage of Jessa and Taylor secret? Especially Taylor? I know Hannah promised Tate to not 'mother' Taylor, but what exactly was the reason why she could not tell the abandoned girl that she, Hannah, is her paternal aunt? How would it have hurt Taylor to know that????? (hide spoiler)]- Taylor and Jonah: (view spoiler)[unprotected sex? Not cool. I'm a gynecologist, and I pay attention to these things, and neither Taylor nor Jonah seem to be at the point in their lives when they seem ready to have a kid - which can happen. STDs are also not cool, you know? Chlamydia is not a joke! I wish Melina Marchetta included a condom-buying scene. It may dampen the mood, but would have provided protection and a nod of approval from this Ob/Gyn doc. (hide spoiler)]And yet, despite my adulthood, despite a few eye-rolls, despite the issues that I describe above, I STILL teared up at the end. I think admitting that will TOTALLY ruin my street cred, but oh well. All the above taken into consideration, 4 easy stars. \"And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.

It's that constant air of enigma and enchantment, that underlying presence of hope mixed with tragedy that draws you in so very thoroughly; all presented without the need for tasteless dramatics, maudlin behavior or overattention to romance.When you can manage making my heart feel so passionately for a person who only exists in whisps of memories throughout the entire course of a novel, I salute you. To me, reading this book felt like a \njourney\n. An experience in and of itself. And quite frankly, the first time, in a long time, that I've been taken away to that far away place we all go to with the simple power of words.Word of advice\u2014 suitably apt mood music will make reading this endlessly more exhilarating.

Going into this, I did not know that these characters and their stories would stick with me for days, weeks, after. Immediately after finishing this book, I felt like starting it all over again. I think Jellicoe Road is best read if you jump into it blindly. So I'll try not to give too much away in this review. \n\u201cThese people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\u201d\nSince the age of eleven Taylor Markham has been at boarding school. At seventeen she is now the chosen leader of her school's underground activities and is in charge of how they proceed in the annual territory wars against the townies and visiting cadets. Taylor's past is filled with abandonment, grief and pain. When her caretaker at school, Hannah, the only adult she trusts, leaves unexpectedly Taylor has a need to know where Hannah could be and in doing so also finds out other unexpected truths.I know many people did not enjoy this book because of the writing style and the confusion of the first half. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But for me, it was perfection. Yes it was confusing but I love figuring things out. We got passages set in the past, which didn't follow a proper time line. The mystery of not knowing what was going on or how things connected added to my enjoyment. I needed to know how everything fit.\u201cAs I walk back to the school on my own, I realise I'm crying. So I go back to the stories I've read about the five and I try to make sense of their lives because in making sense of theirs, I may understand mine.\u201dI really loved the setting. I have never read a book set in Australia before and it was super interesting to read about. This was set around Christmas time which is the summer holidays in Australia. I could totally relate to that as I too live in the southern hemisphere. I am surprised by how quickly I became attached to the characters. Those in the past and present. I wanted them to be happy, to confront their fears and to be together. \u201cBecause people with that much spirit frighten the hell out of me. They make me want to be a better person when I know it's not possible.\u201dThe side characters were so well fleshed out. And I was just as invested in their stories as I was in Taylor's. Their character growth and development and their own struggles was so beautiful to read. Watching them become more to one another brought me such joy. \u201cBut grief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for.\u201dThis is a book that I will reread again and again and know that eveytime it will still impact me as it did the first time I read it. I think what also added to my experience was that I read this with a group of besties. We'd text eachother our thoughts and laugh about how much this book was making us cry.

Low Points.When I read books (real books, not Kindle ones because they have the nifty \u2018Add Notes/Highlights\u2019 button) I have a pink polka dot notebook that I jot down page numbers, thoughts and quotes in. I know that\u2019s not a radical thing to do because I know a lot of people who do similar things, and as I read this novel I found myself writing down questions that I believed would be answered at the end. Most of them were and everything made sense, but there were two questions that I had that I really wanted to know the answers to. The answers wouldn't really add anything to the story... I'm just nosey.Not that I\u2019m hankering after a sequel because this book was perfect on its own and I think a sequel would be pointless, but I feel like I need to sit Ms Marchetta down and ask her my questions just for some closure. So, if you\u2019re ever in Manchester MM, there\u2019s a caffeinated drink on me!Heroine.I loved loved loved Taylor Markham and from the first page I knew that she was going to be a part of the League of Soul Sisters (along with Vera, Katniss (don\u2019t mention Mockingjay), Viola and The Rat) that I am considering setting up.I\u2019m going to be the \u2018funny one\u2019 in this group, obviously, because I lack the coolness, wit, feistiness and the ability to throw a ball in a straight line never mind shoot an arrow. Taylor was the perfect mix of disgruntled moody teenager, spunky heroine and confused young girl. Yes, she can teeter on the edge of being a bitch but I think that\u2019s what I liked about her. She\u2019s flawed and she\u2019s normal and she\u2019s trying to deal with so much I practically encouraged her to be a bit prickly. YA fiction is so full of impossibly perfect heroines that make it so hard to relate to. But I really related to Taylor and her outlook on life and in the time it took me to read this book, I found myself really caring about what happened to her. And I think that\u2019s why a lot of people really love this book. So yeah, Taylor, keep your eye out for the postman because there's an official invitation in the post for you...Love Interest.Oh Jonah. When I heard you described by many a girl as the mysterious loner with a dark and tortured past, I have to admit that alarm bells were going off.There\u2019s something about the word \u2018mysterious\u2019 and 'loner' when used to describing boys that triggers an alarming adverse reaction in me (lots of frowning, yawning, skipping of pages, eye-rolling, eye-clawing-out etc).But you, Jonah Griggs, you are my kind of guy and you are allowed your dark and tortured past. I don\u2019t want to say a lot on this subject because if you haven\u2019t read it already then you need to experience JG first hand. But this guy brings the swoon and I have to agree with Taylor on one thing (well, on most things, but this one in particular)\u2026 I prefer him in his fatigues. BOOM.Also an honourable mention has to go to Santangelo, with his abs (don\u2019t worry Taylor, I wouldn\u2019t look away either) and Ben, my violinist and his medieval jousting. Hot damn. Theme Tune.Local Boy in the Photograph - Stereophonics. I immediately thought of this song... not just the subject matter but the whole message of the lyrics. Bitter sweet. Angst Scale.9/10. I really don\u2019t want to say anything in this department for fear of spoiling things. But my favourite part of this book was the way past events were interwoven with the present day and how they affected the characters. I found these passages that were filled with innocence, hope, lost youth, impossible situations and, most importantly, the power of best friends so beautiful and captivating. Recommended For.EVERYONE. People who love mystery books. People who are comfortable with having butterflies in their stomach permanent because when JG brings the swoon\u2026 sorry, I\u2019ll stop.

Quite possibly, my favorite book of the year, because it is so unique and so gut-wrenching and so enrapturing it deserves the title. This book is not merely a reading experience; this book is a journey. One filled with two emotional plotlines, past and present, that overlap in places only to thread themselves together in a masterful and sad, yet agonizingly beautiful story. \n\nThis book is about finding yourself. About hating the world and cursing the universe for forcing you to exist when you're left abandoned by everyone else. About your whole life being a question mark. And about finally opening up to the world and embracing it to the fullest. \n\u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d\nThis book is about love, every kind of love. The one between siblings. The one that's so intense it's everything to you and leaves you dying when that love suddenly stops. The one that's as natural as breathing. The one that you try to bury beneath excuses. And about the love for life, for living, despite it continuously trying to shove you down. \n\u201cIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d\nThis book is about the ugliness of humanity. About serial killers. About drug addiction. About neglected children. About pedophilia and child pornography. About goddamn cancer. About abuse. About suicide. About car accidents. About being parentless. About loss and about death. \n\u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d\nBut, I believe, most importantly, this book is about friendships. I cannot find the words to describe how amazing the friendships portrayed in this novel are. They just filled me up with immense joy and plastered smiles on my face and gave me a sense of family. With their banter, their bromance, their love for mischief, their leadership, their honesty, their support for one another and their endless, boundless, eternal love. \n\nAlso, this book is about clever and magical storytelling. About how an author can enthrall you with some words on a page and make you cry like you lost someone dear to you. About how she can twist your heart and make you curse out loud for (fictional) live being so unfair. About how she can give you goosebumps and butterflies in your stomach and sighs and accelerated heartbeats. And this book is about me and how I have fallen in love with its every single character. I love Taylor. I love Jonah. I love Santangelo. I love Raffy. I love Ben. I love Jessa. I love Trini. I even love Chloe P. and Richard and Sam. And I adore Webb and Narnie and Tate and Fitz and Jude. They were the backbone of this book, its essence, its soul. And oh, Fitz, I just want to hug the poor precious boy. And oh, Narnie, I just want to destroy her numbness.And oh, Tate, I just want to hold her hand and be there for her.And oh, Jude, I just want to save him from the heartache. And oh, Webb, I just want to place him in the sky between the stars where he belongs because he is perfection. After I finished reading at 5AM, I kept asking myself: Why haven't I read this sooner? How much can a single person cry in one night? How much can you love a book? What to do with my life now? And so here I am, begging you to read this book if you haven't done so yet. Let it be a journey for you. \n\u201cYou just have to belong. Long to be.\u201d\nI'll go back to my sobbing now, thank you.

Everybody in it is fucked up, and living their lives is fucked up, and by the time you're done with it, you're fucked up, but you can't tell because your head is cloudy from all the tears you've shed getting through this fucked-up book. I hate On The Jellicoe Road. I hate books that make me cry, and this book made me want to weep tears of blood for all that lost youth and promise, and the pain of loss and the promise of the future. If somebody had told me how mixed-up and emotional this book was going to make me feel, I would have abandoned it in a corner and floated off to the simple uncomplicated world of supernatural ass-kicking, where nobody dies and even if they do, they rarely stay dead. In the big debate of Saving Francesca versus Jellicoe Road, I would have to pick Jellicoe Road. I liked Francesca better, but that's because it made me laugh and think and smile mistily, but it never, ever, shoved me into the wringer and brought me out feeling like a limp dishcloth. It never made me feel that piercing tender pain you get when you think of things long past that can never be regained. It never made me feel like I was drowning in the lives of people who are so real, it's hard to believe they don't exist and haven't consumed your life. Jellicoe Road is a harsher, deeper read, the sandpaper to Francesca's paint peeler. Undeniably, the writing is brilliant. It's evocative and tender, it makes the emotions in each page almost tangible. The characters are drawn brilliantly too, and despite the fact that over half of the main cast wants to kill themselves at one point or the other, you cannot help but be drawn to them. I loved Taylor and Griggs and Santangelo and Raffy, but my heart got well and truly tangled up with Narnie and Webb and Judd and Tate and Fitz. It's for them that my heart broke, and shattered into a million pieces. The story is told largely from the perspective of Taylor, but it is the ghosts that predominate, that breathe life into the story, ironic as that sounds. This is not a book for people who want a straightforward love story with a dash of drama. This is for people who want to appreciate good writing, and don't mind losing a little bit of themselves between the covers of a book in the process. Oh man, this book is just so seriously Fucked.

Will review tomorrow when I can wrap my head around what to write.*moves ahead a day in time*After sleeping on it, I'm still struggling with how to write a proper review. There are some books which are virtually impossible to explain, and this is one of them. The GR book summary gives no indication what the book is really about, and truth be told, I'm not sure you'd want to know what the book is about before reading it.The first 150 pages or so are completely frustrating and confusing. I knew this ahead of time, but I also knew that just about every single person who has read this has said the exact same thing, yet still gave the book 5 stars. There is a reason for this. The first part of the book is only giving you glimpses of the player's lives and their world. It almost reminded me of one of those movies that you watch in reverse, where the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the end - yet not quite. All I can do is echo the voices of those who prodded me to read the book - DON'T GIVE UP. You will not forget this book. You will not regret reading. It is so worth the read. Keep some tissues handy.As the story unfolds, the author starts giving us a crumb of information, then another, then another. Slowly the pieces of a broken story come together as one revelation follows another in a wave - a very emotional wave at that. Just when you think you've heard it all, more starts to come. Then more, then more. Pay attention to every single character. Just about every person's life is intertwined with the other characters in this story.I'm done trying to prod you to read this. Just read it. You will not be sorry for making the effort. Please, I beg you...battle through the first part of the book (which is confusing) until you get to the part that starts to get into your soul. Let's call this a dare.

(Ok, I might have lost that chance, maybe in a new life then, lol)__________________Full (former) review:It took me 113 days to write a full review.. I counted.\n\nReading one of Marchetta\u2019s stories should be one of the \u201c10 things to do in your lifetime\u201d. Seriously, this woman is one of the most creative people alive, one of the most amazing writers I came across and I wish I could put into words the awesomeness of this book, but I feel at a loss for words once more.In fact, I should invent a new language with a dictionary full of ways to praise her talent.Because Melina Marchetta doesn\u2019t only write books, she creates entire worlds full of fleshed-out characters and shattering emotions, and after you read about them you feel like you\u2019re the luckiest person in the known Universe and beyond. Because not many people in this world are able to feel what she makes you feel, and not many authors get to create such strong connections between the characters and the reader.I feel like her stories have a soul. Like her characters are living beings trappend into a fantasy world, waiting for us to come and listen to their stories. They seem to breathe through our emotions, and I don\u2019t remember a moment when I didn\u2019t feel something (deep) towards this story and these wonderful characters.Her words sing to me, they reach into the deep core of my own soul, they make me laugh through tears, they break my heart into thousand pieces but they also put it back in together, making it beat in a whole new rhythm, making it love and ache on a different level.Once again, the complexity of the plot left me lightheaded, in awe, even though I knew what was coming my way. It\u2019s been a while since the last time I read this book and I felt it all all over again: the confusion, the despair, the hope, the heartbreak, the happiness. My teary eyes could barely read and I was left breathless too many times to count. I loved EVERYTHING about this book, after all this time it is still my favorite story and I really hope that when (and if) you read this book you will be able to feel just a tiny-tiny part off all these blissful emotions flowing through my heart right now.\n\nTHE STORY:How much heartbreak can a heart take?Jellicoe road is a roller coaster, a story meant to break hearts \u2013 one about true friendship and love, about forgiveness and salvation, about hope and disappointment, about life and death and everything in between.It simply left me in awe again because there is no tiny detail, there is nothing less important in this story. Everything has value, all words have power \u2013 to make you laugh or cry, to dream and hope.. and the real beauty of it is connecting all the threads in this fabulous piece of art.But as heartbreaking and intense as it might be, it is also fun, and I found myself smiling more than once. So don\u2019t go thinking that this is a depressing book, it is not; it has the perfect balance between joy and sadness, between delight and heartbreak \u2013 but don\u2019t believe me, see it for yourself!THE CHARACTERS:I can\u2019t put into words how much compassion I felt towards the characters in this story. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one that didn\u2019t leave an impression on me. Some times they made me laugh (even through tears), some other I just wanted to hold them close to my heart and protect them from all the hurt in their lives.\n\nCONCLUSION:Every time I read \u201cOn the Jellicoe Road\u201d it simply takes my breath away.I fall in love with this book all over again, it hits me full strength no matter how well I think I know the story, it makes me smile and cry and sometimes both in the same time, all while I get drunk on the beauty of Marchetta\u2019s words. Pure talent, pure Aussie awesomeness!\n\nThe full review can be found at: ReadingAfterMidnight.com ____________________________________________Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO)____________________________________________Favourite quote (one of the many):\n\n--PS: And now allow me to express my joy:PSS: Is this Jonah coming to life? :D", "num_likes": 79, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["death-and-dying", "movie-to-be", "arc-galley-or-author", "rereading-material", "standalone", "great-books", "beloved", "best-of", "top-ten", "aussie-and-nz"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1390613767", "review_id": "1390613767", "date": "Sep 13, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Nicole", "user_url": "/user/show/40997852-nicole", "text": "The Reader\u2019s Guide to the Jellicoe Road is a wholly unremarkable review. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many days and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from a countless numbers of experienced readers and researchers. The introduction begins like this: \u201cOn the Jellicoe road,\u201d it says, \u201cis good. Really good. You just won\u2019t believe how phenomenally amazingly mind-bogglingly good it is. I mean, you may think it\u2019s confusing up the road, but that\u2019s just normal. Listen\u2026\u201d and so on. (After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that it'll make you cry, laugh, lose hope, love, grieve, hope again, smile, shake, and all kinds of emotions but hate. There's nothing to hate there. Moreover, it gives directions to the best way to read this book and gives some very illogical arguments.) The guide provides the best way to read on the Jellicoe road, it goes something like this:1. know a bit but not much background2. use your brain3. bring a box of tissues It goes even further and explains each point. \u2780Taylor\u2019s life and the italic paragraphs intertwine together to deliver a beautiful story. Our MC is not perfect. In fact, there isn't any perfect character in this book but you\u2019ll love all of them. No exceptions.The guide goes a bit off topic so we had to cut the rest of the paragraphs and get back to the actual summary.[\u2026]Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school. Hannah, who works there, found her alone (left in a restaurant) and took her in when she was 11. However, when Hannah disappears leaving Taylor more lost than ever and our MC is selected to lead the territory war against the Townies (people from the town) and the Cadets (military students) her whole life is about to change. It doesn\u2019t end there, the leader of the Cadets is none other than Jonah Griggs with whom she shared an unforgettable history. Her obsession about finding her mother only complicates matters. All of this will change not only her perspective of her life forever but her future as well. \u2781 Have fun reading this book, literally. Try to come up with your own theories because believe me when I say I, every word Marchetta writes has a purpose. It\u2019s also not impossible to make correct predications because I did. Make assumptions, link everything, analyze, think, whatever you want. Just don\u2019t sit there waiting for the author to tell you what\u2019s happening. If you don\u2019t, you probably won\u2019t like the book. Things start to make a bit more sense after page 100 and everything will be clear only by the end of the book. So you\u2019ll have a hard time reading On the Jellicoe Road if you try to be only a passive reader. \u2782 Happy moments, sad moments, nothing moments, my tears kept running. It was just so emotional and beautiful not in a forced way. Sometimes you feel like the author is telling you: it\u2019s time to cry!! Not here. This book made me want to lay down, curl in ball, and just cry forever. Sure, there are tragedies here but it\u2019s not just that. While the amazing writing style definitely helps, you\u2019ll just feel like you\u2019re a part of the story and not just an outsider who is reading a book. You\u2019ll share the characters joy, sadness, hardships, adventures, friendships, love, and hope, just everything. (Expert from The Reader\u2019s guide to the Jellicoe Roadpage 49372, Section 3b. Entry: the characters.)The best thing about this book is the characters. I mean yes everything about this book is the best thing but these are special. They are so memorable and real that you\u2019ll love each and every one of them. It\u2019s really hard to pick a favorite because you\u2019ll find yourself relating to each person one way or another. You\u2019ll wait with Jude to meet his best friends (who will become yours too but just one sided :p) each September, you\u2019ll share Taylor\u2019s difficulties trying to manage her house, you\u2019ll enjoy the time she spends with her new not so friends, you\u2019ll try so hard to discover the reason behind Hannah\u2019s disappearance, you\u2019ll fall in love with Jonah and Santangelo\u2026 You\u2019ll just feel like you\u2019re part of the story and the characters who are flawed and very realistic will make you want to read about their adventures forever. \nA Final Note from the Author:\nRead this book. It was hard to review it because I find it hard to review the books I loved. I really think this book should be more popular. Best YA contemporary I've ever read. Melina Marchetta is a genius. On the Jellicoe Road is what I call a \nContemporary Young-Adult Masterpiece.\nI wrote this review after reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and I couldn\u2019t help borrowing the writing style", "num_likes": 98, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites", "ya", "2017"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1115204373", "review_id": "1115204373", "date": "Dec 30, 2016", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Claudia Ram\u00edrez", "user_url": "/user/show/13061577-claudia-ram-rez", "text": "4.5 stars.", "num_likes": 69, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2016", "made-me-cry", "top-2016"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/102012272", "review_id": "102012272", "date": "May 09, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Flannery", "user_url": "/user/show/652877-flannery", "text": "A lot of people think that Henry David Thoreau* went to Walden to live a solitary life. I felt like that until I actually went to Walden Pond. Imagine my surprise when some friends and I decided to go for a hike, go for a swim and check out the scenery--we left Boston around 9...and we got there by 9:30. Yeah right, HDT, I could live deliberately in the woods, too, if I knew my transcendentalist cronies would bring me a Cinnabon and some pumpkin ale once in awhile.** Nevertheless, Thoreau\u2019s idea served as the inspiration for Yeats\u2019 poem Lake Isle of Innisfree*** from which Melina Marchetta quotes in this novel. Yeats, who looks a little like Kenneth from 30 Rock, wrote about Innisfree because, to him, it served as an idyllic place where he could always go for peace and solitude. (I find it rather amusing that both Thoreau and Yeats wrote fascinating works about livin\u2019 la vida simple that become so popular. Lesson: If you find a perfect place, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF)But Marchetta's magnificent storytelling was only enhanced by her reference to Yeats' poem. Instead of pounding quotations into your head, like a sad number of authors do, Marchetta only mentioned Innisfree once in passing...but it stuck with me through the rest of the book.I don\u2019t want to go into the plot of this book too deeply, for the point I took away from the book is that we all have those idyllic places we go to in our minds. For some of the characters in this novel, their Innisfree was with family, or with their childhood friends, or even just spending time with one particular person. It doesn't have to be a place at all. No matter how far we get away from those memories, they are always all polished up in our minds like the Hope Diamond when we need to imagine a perfect place in time.Marchetta\u2019s characters, as usual, were intriguing and fleshed out. It is constantly amazing to me that I can read a book and be unable to visualize even the protagonist, while this author is able to give me an extensive cast of characters and I feel like each one of them is someone I know. From Santangelo to Griggs to Raffy to the Brigadier, I understood where they were coming from and could reasonable predict what they would do in a situation. Very rarely was I frustrated with choices that characters made. (view spoiler)[Though I wish Hannah and Jude got together earlier and that they had raised Taylor as mother and father. To deprive her of a childhood that could\u2019ve been better than it was out of loyalty to Tate was, though perhaps understandable, still frustrating. Same for Jessa. (hide spoiler)] I also have no idea how Marchetta can make my heart hurt one moment and make me hysterically laugh the next.I must admit that the territory war aspect of the novel was not my favorite, though I understand its place in the overall story. (view spoiler)[When it all comes to a close, I wonder if next year\u2019s students, Townies, and cadets will see fit to just share the area? (hide spoiler)] The transfer back and forth between Taylor's present day and Hannah's story was rough for the first fourth or so of the book. If you try it and get stuck, please truck through it--it is so worth it.As I knock each of Melina Marchetta\u2019s book off my to-be-read stack, I am a little more sad. When I\u2019m done with them, how long will I have to wait for a new one?*The Wikipedia entry for HDT informs me that he wore a \u201cneckbeard\u201d for many years and insisted many women found it attractive. 1) I never knew that hideousness had a name; and 2) If you are a woman that finds a neckbeard attractive and we are friends on here, just go ahead and defriend me.**He was only 1.5 miles from his homeboy Emerson\u2019s house.***This poem is the shit.EDIT: I listened to the first third or so of this book and read the rest in book form.

Man, the author is lucky that books don't have hotlines where you can phone in to complain about your lack of customer satisfaction, because I'd be on the line right now, saying, \"Dafuque-ce que c'est?\" Comme \u00e7a.JELLICOE ROAD is an utterly nonsensical book that appears to thrive on its own pretension. Taylor, the main character, spends all of her time either whining or crying, and her biggest claim to fame is that she's in charge of this stupid mock-war her school fights with the locals and the local military school for \"territory.\" If that sounds confusing, don't worry - it's never explained, it doesn't make sense, and it's just as childish and lame as it sounds. Oh, and she's in love with the local bad boy military student who ~betrayed~ her once, many a summer ago.Looped in with this Risk LARPing is the story of some other pretentious kids with ~issues~ who are connected with Taylor's story in a mysterious way. This other POV was incredibly boring and I skimmed it, and yes, the payoff was just as disappointing as I'd imagined it would be, and surprise, surprise, I was able to predict most of it. I'm guessing this is the part of the story that made people shed tears, but mostly I just thought it was lame. And pretentious.I guess if you want to read about the most boring LARP session ever with a tepid love story that makes TWILIGHT seem deep and profound by comparison, read this book.

You find that reading it a second time offers you a whole other reading experience. Those once slow 100 pages now whiz you by, and you realise it was not the pace that was at fault, but your confusion.You savour it so much more. Make sense of certain references - crush on the plot, characters and writing, and fall in love with Jonah Griggs all over again.It frustrates me so much to know that I can never do this book justice. That so many readers out there have yet to read this beauty. The thing is, somehow, even though I knew what was going to happen, I choked up and laughed like a mad women at the exact same scenes I did the first time around. What made me smile at times was how the little tissues were still there. So many times I would be about to bookmark a certain moment only to realise that it was already bookmarked. I suppose I know myself too well ;)When I approached the last 100 pages I decided to read them outside in the garden. I have never had that urge before, but It was dark outside, silent and soothing in a way that I couldn't imagine it being inside. It felt right to read those last pages alone - in a peaceful surrounding. Yet, like last time, I dreaded that last page, and when it had ended - I closed the book and just allowed my thoughts to take over and savour them, because I knew it would be a long time before any other book would ever make me feel like this again. I took that moment to mourn characters and a world I genuinely felt I had lost - taking some solace in the fact that I would return to them when the feeling of loss became close to unbearable.You know, I can see myself reading this every year, discovering something new every time, loving the characters even more - if that's even possible.Once again I was left with this undeniable ache that made me want to be a part of these characters lives, but I think what bothered me the most, and what really made me feel somewhat of a loss, was knowing that I will never know a Tate, Hannah, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Jonah, Ben, Raffy, Chaz, Jessa, and Taylor. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to something personal every time I turn over that last page, but now I know that's hardly the case.

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic?

This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book?1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work.3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that.4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO.5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead?Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story \"speaks\" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world.

And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall. It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that's objectively wrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:\"What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids? Whaaaat?\" But this setting does begin to feel much more appropriate once you get a bit further in.God, everyone in this novel was so intense.Once I started realizing what was going on, who was who, and why certain things were relevant... Damn. My heart was beating so fast while making these discoveries, and they are all individually and magnificently devastating.This is a book that slowly sinks its claws into you, and before you know it you're caught.

I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta.On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter ~ I was spellbound. I remember thinking it was beautiful and haunting and funny and so entirely utterly appealing ~ the prose and the mystery and the characters. I guess I did feel a little like: what is going on? But not in a distracting way. It was absorbing and engaging and mesmerising. And entirely unexpected.I LOVED how gorgeously chaotic the story initially felt. I knew NOTHING about it ~ I even wondered if Santangelo would be the love interest in the early days (which quickly flew from my mind as Jonah's (JONAH!) story started unravelling).I LOVE that I knew nothing about it. Not one review, not one opinion. I had my expectations of awesomeness (it was, after all, a Melina Marchetta and I had read (and re-read) her previous two books countless times. Reading it blindly was a stunning experience: I felt like the whole world was just me and the book. That the entire experience was mine. That no one had gone before me. That the story was for me and I was a part of the story. I still feel like that, in a way. I see others discovering it and loving it and I am SO proud of it (as if, somehow, it is mine, haha) ~ but a small part of me feels like it belongs uniquely to me. More to me than anyone else (I know this is a ridiculous sentiment, but I still feel it). I almost feel private about it ~ as if it has become a part of me and talking about is like letting others peek into my soul.That very first time: I read it all in one go. I was shattered and absorbed and breathless and incredulous. I fell in love with the characters and the prose and the setting. I still recall finishing the book and how I felt gutted and euphoric and in awe all at once. Too stunned to cry (even though it would have been lovely to weep), I lay in my bed for an hour, just thinking about it. And then ... I picked it up and started reading it from the beginning all over again. Since then, I have read it every year (sometimes more than once). It has never lost it's magic. It weaves itself deeper into me. It is my own personal cult book <3It seems ridiculous that I have not reviewed my favourite book of all time. I think I just feel entirely too inadequate to be up the the task. I also feel like it is such a part of me that I want to hold it close and not share it with the world. Yet another part of me feels like I could talk about it all day long and never tire of things to say and quotes to quote. This isn't a review, per se. It is me, humbly telling you, that 'On The Jellicoe Road' is my favourite book of all time. It is brilliant and hopeful and ache-y and truly soul-changing. It is the kind of chaotically gorgeous masterpiece that you only ever-so-rarely stumble across. It is perfect in it's brilliance. It radiates life and hope even as it is filled with grief and sorrow. It is everything,  everything , I love about reading, in such a way that it almost ruined me for other books ;) I am completely undone for it.

What? You fucking cry, what do you think?Well, you have seen me gushing frantically obsessing over this book for a while now, so you know you have to brace yourself because this book? It possibly became my favorite. Ever. That kind of means something when we read a million book a year, right? \n\"I fall in love with these kids over and over again and my heart aches for their tragedies and marvels at their friendship\".\n \u2592 This book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592Why is it so special to me? You mean, except from the fact it's written by Marchetta and contains Jonah Griggs in it? Apart from that? Well, what you need to know is that few authors manage to change my perception of myself as a reader. Yet if there's something I learnt this year, that's Melina Marchetta's books are written in a way that makes me want to create a stamp which would say - That says it all. The reason I rarely cry when I read is the fact I hate feeling manipulated. I loathe it when I can see through the author's intentions and I'm pretty sure that's why I never succeeded in finishing The fault in our stars. Melina Marchetta's books show me something I was eager to learn, because even if I knew it deep down inside, I was seeking out the moment I'd unravel all my doubts : No, I'm not a cold-hearted reader. I was just longing for stories which really speak to me, because, never, ever again I want to find myself thinking 'oh, I think I'm supposed to cry right now'. The beauty of her books lies in the surprise they never fail to create in me : I could express it with a single word : suddenly.And that emergence of unexpected feelings? I live for that shit. \u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592Jellicoe road takes us into the life of characters so strongly convinced of the uselessness of their life that we want to fight for them. We want to tear the appearances out, and above all that, we're grateful to Melina Marchetta because her characters are so relatable and real that we can find pieces of ourselves in them. Pieces of our friends. Pieces of our family. Pieces of my heart that broke for Jonah Griggs over and over again. \n\"Please don\u2019t be crazy, Taylor,\u201d Griggs whispers, leaning his head against mine. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be crazy.\u201d He kisses me, holding my face between his hands, whispering over and over again, \u201cPlease\".\n Therefore don't worry if you're confused throughout the 100 first pages, I swear to you, there must surely come a stage when you'll find yourself utterly captivated by Taylor's journey. Moreover, after reading it a second time, I can assure you that this experience was even more emotional and that Marchetta wrapped her plot brilliantly - I noticed some things I couldn't see the first time and WOW. Just WOW. This structure? Incredible. Everything has a sense. Everything has a purpose. Nothing's useless. Nothing. \u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592This is a tale about where we belong. Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it love? Can we stop belonging somewhere? Can we earn the right to belong or is it something we have in our heart no matter what we do? Can we allow somebody else to be our everything? Because what happens, I'm asking I'm yelling, what happens if our everything disappears? *whisper* Do we disappear as well?Now, I don't want to scare you how that's too late? and I can assure you that Jellicoe Road isn't the kind of book that makes your eyes ache all long without never releasing the tension. No. That's just life, you know? So prepare yourself for a ride - you're going to laugh, to be pissed, to be desperate at times, to lose hope and then fight to find it again - You're going to live and feel and smile. \n\"Go on, admit it. When he hits the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\"\n\u2592  But this book. This fucking BOOK. \u2592I don't want to talk about the plot. Damn, I just can't and I'll say only one thing : even if I guessed some parts of the mystery pretty fast, following Taylor and Jonah was an experience I'd have been sad to miss and that captivating and splendorous story will linger in my heart and in my thoughts for a very long time.\nYou know what you have to do.\n \n\"I reach the bottom and smash into him with my fists as hard as I can. He falls and I can't believe he goes down that easy, caught off balance.\"You care about nothing, you piece of shit!\"I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.\"Never,\" he tells me in a tone full of ice, \"under-estimate who or what I care for.\u201d\nPS : I have a million quotes to write, a million stories about Jonah, Webbs, Tate, Narny, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, Jessa to tell. But I won't. I won't because this is a book which must be savored blind. I won't even if Jonah Griggs is certainly one of the characters I will never forget.

FREAKING. STOP. The beginning was a little confusing because the author just kind of throws you into the story with zero background or knowledge of what\u2019s going on. But as the story goes on, little hints and clues and these crazy coincidences start to appear and the whole time you\u2019re like holy shit didn\u2019t this happen before? Wait, is she that girl? OMG IT IS! What does this mean??!?I\u2019m going to try to explain what this story is all about without spoiling anything so if you do happen to pick this up (AND YOU TOTALLY SHOULD) you\u2019ll have a little background.The heroine Taylor \u2013 who I would like to point out was such a great complex character - was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road when she was 11. She doesn\u2019t know why but is brought to the Jellicoe School. And at this school, the kids are spread among \u2018houses\u2019 (think of a type of sorority/fraternity). Taylor is elected to be the leader of her house and to lead the school\u2019s annual territory wars versus the Townies (the kids who go to I guess what would be equivalent to public school) and the Cadets (kids from a type of military school). And among the wars and fights and negotiations for things like access to biking trails and club houses, etc., Taylor is trying to figure out why her house mother has gone missing, why she dreams of the same boy every night and if he is trying to tell her something, why her mother abandoned her all those years ago, and how it\u2019s all connected.Insert Jonah Griggs. The leader of the Cadets, and the boy who stole the show and my heart. He is without a FREAKING DOUBT what made this story for me. He and Taylor have a history (even though they are supposed to hate each other while the \u2018wars\u2019 are going on.) His backstory was absolutely heartbreaking. The romance in this was very subtle but his moments with Taylor were so powerful and romantic and beautiful and had me wanting to cry like a child. All he wants is to help her heal and figure out the mystery of her past.\n\"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201d__\u201cWhat are you thinking? \u201cI whisper after a while.\u201cThat you deserve romance,\u201d he says.\n And this whole book is so much more than the mystery. It\u2019s about love and family and friendship and acceptance and fate and okay I need to stop before I start crying because I really fell in love with this whole thing. I didn\u2019t expect to love this book so much, and just want to SHOUT about how much I did. I love picking up books not knowing where the hell it is all going and just being blown away in the end.

Treat with care.Hand me a contemporary written by Marchetta, and I'll turn into a tsunami of tears.This review is not going to be as extensive as my usual ones, but please be so kind to check out my co-blogger Chantal's lovely review on our blog \nEvery Word A Doorway\n.I've avoided On the Jellicoe Road for years tbh. Probably because I had loved Saving Francesca so much in my youth and was scared that no other Marchetta book would ever compare. Finnikin of the Rock certainly couldn't, and I strongly believe Marchetta was born to be a realistic fiction writer, not a creator of fantasy worlds. So then I was at my local book store last winter and Chantal all but forced me to buy this. My history of avoiding this book continued, however, as it sat lonely and misplaced on my shelf. Last week, I finally decided to pick it up. Which brings us to the sobfest that is my broken self after reading this book. \nSaving Francesca\n is still closer to my heart, mainly due to its topics, but On the Jellicoe Road felt quite similar in style with its troubled main character, witty side protagonists, brooding love interest, school setting, and the serious issues it tackles. I adored the characters, especially the main character, as much as I enjoyed the dark humour from the first person POV from which the story was told. Compared to Saving Francesca, this book has a touch of mystery, as snippets of a manuscript appear between chapters, slowly unravelling along with the main character's personal storyline. Marchetta also never sugarcoats a first and/or young love which I value in a genre full of unicorns and rainbows. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because the beginning is too abrupt a start. The first chapter was both confusing and unnerving, making me wonder whether I wanted to continue, and it took me quite some time go become invested in the story thereafter. A smoother introduction would've been required. Besides shattering my heart and then glueing the pieces together again, On the Jellicoe Road brought on a massive flood of nostalgic childhood memories from Australia. Have your characters call a stroll in nature a 'bushwalk', their nightgowns a 'nightie' and each other 'mate', and I'll be a little curled up ball of homesickness. Can I just spread the love for these little shits who warmed my heart? \n\"I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs.\" Anson Choi feigns surprise. \"What's her name?\"\"I didn't actually catch her name,\" Griggs continues.\"Lily,\" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look.\"Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.\"\"It's Taylor's middle name,\" Raffaela calls back again.Placing Raffaela in the path of an oncoming car becomes one of the major priorities of the next ten seconds of my life.\nWith their hysterical fits and unexpected violent outbursts coming from gentle characters? \n\"Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?\"\nOn the Jellicoe Road is a beautiful book that will move you, grip you, and enchant you with fleshed out characters, an air of mystery, and a touching story.

I am not usually given in to melodramatics but this beautiful book evoked a riot of feelings in my ice-box of a heart.On The Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham overlapping with that of another mysterious narrator whose point of view is in italic.Taylor Markham is a leader of one of the houses at the Jellicoe School, her history is riddled with more questions than answers. Unanchored to anyone, or to anything, she feels lost, an outsider to her own story looking in.\u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201dShe craves history, and Hannah, her only link to the past, had disappeared without a word. In her quest to find Hannah, with a jumbled and unfinished manuscript as her only clue, Taylor inadvertently comes to grips with the pain of her mother's abandonment and fleeting memories of being loved. While Taylor is finally confronting her past, she is also leading the Jellicoe School in territory wars against the Townie and the Cadets. The Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a boy whom Taylor spent a few eventful days with years ago.I am not fond of young adult books dealing with difficult topics because the teenage angst and drama irk me off, but On The Jellicoe Road is the exception. Of course, with the topics explored in this book, some angst and drama are inevitable, but Melina Marchetta is never heavy handed with them. She writes emotions on levels we, or at least I, understand.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.\u201dShe can pack one hell of a left hook right in the solar plexus with a single word, a testament of her compelling, lyrical writing. Damn you, Marchetta.The characters are terrific, they are raw, layered and relatable. I wanted to hang-out with Taylor, Jonah, Raffy and Santangelo in the tree-house. I still do, honestly. Taylor is especially complicated. Who wouldn't be, given her situation. The most remarkable thing about Taylor and her narrative is the air of pragmatic self-destructiveness. Like she is always on the verge of spiraling down.\u201cI do keep him at the back of my mind for those times I get me hopes raised about something. So then I can slap myself into reality and remind myself of what happens when you let someone into your sacred space.\u201d...but yeah, read the book if she truly does.The plot ties up neatly in the end and I am more than satisfied with the ending, but it takes some patience to get to the ending. You see, like Kintsukoroi, On The Jellicoe Road starts with broken pieces or fragments of a life, of a story, that may not make sense at first but as the the novel progresses, the pieces will fit and by the end you'll have yourself a beautiful whole story. So do yourself a favor and just let yourself be lost in this gem of a book,don't even back-track. I promise, it pays off in the end.On The Jellicoe Road is a story of friendship, love, forgiveness and grief. It's so much more, but I'll end it at that. I did not cry but that's more on my damaged tear ducts than the book,but okay fine, I admit, it also kind of, well, broke me. Yet somehow I am filled with hope for the characters in the book and for the young adult genre.

I thought I gave myself enough time for a better perspective and drier eyes, but hot DAMN I\u2019m crying again! I don\u2019t like to cry, and I don\u2019t do it very often because I can\u2019t stand how it feels. But would I trade the emotional experience of this book for steadier breathes and calmer emotions? Not a chance! I\u2019ll keep the experience of Jellicoe Road thank you very much.Melina Marchetta is a true contender for top YA Novelist of the century. She has a gift that I can\u2019t describe because her stories manage to make me feel emotions that frankly I can\u2019t explain. Her poetic narrative conveys moments of brilliance that do nothing short of take my breath away and not always because I\u2019m sobbing like a baby. But, because I\u2019m so moved by her honest and magical ability of capturing her characters and putting them on stage in a way that makes me lean forward, open my mind and expose my heart. Jellicoe Road owned me for the six plus hours it had my attention and I\u2019ll tell you right now, it\u2019ll own me every year maybe twice a year because there is no way in HALE I\u2019ll put this book on the shelf to collect dust. This story is one I\u2019ll be revisiting multiple times and if anyone wants to journey with me, then grab a page and hold on because you\u2019re in for a ride. Now, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that the first 100 pages or so had me in a state of blissful confusion, but then this moment happens where the cloud is lifted and you find yourself connecting with every single element this book has to offer. Color me awed. In this story, I had the privilege of meeting Taylor Markham. She was abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven and her story is one of living in a boarding school and being challenged to lead during a time and place where her school faces Townies and Cadets in a power struggle of a long standing territory war. This book is so carefully designed using two tragic moments in time and blending a large cast of characters that take the reader on a journey of loss, grief and ultimate hope. Jellicoe Road is extremely character driven with Taylor & Ben leading the boarding school; Santangelo and the Mullet Brothers representing the townies; and Jonah Griggs and Choi negotiating for the Cadets. There is also a cast of past characters including Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude that have their own story to share, which serves as the catalyst for the territory wars and the tragedy that transcends through to the present. Taylor and Jonah Griggs were a perfect pair. I loved every moment they spent together and every emotion they shared. Wow, if I could bottle those moments up, I\u2019d carry them around with me forever! Okay and I just have to say that Jonah Griggs\u2026 Ummmm Wow! Just wow! By the way, you say both Jonah and Griggs\u2026 it\u2019s a state of mind\u2026 not just a name. I will never forget this character. At first I didn\u2019t like him at all, but then he brought a bucket of water to the game and I knew he was going to tug at my heart strings. Mission accomplished. ~emphatic pointing at self~ I\u2019m a Jonah Griggs fan.Overall, this book is more than a story, it\u2019s truly an experience that shouldn\u2019t be missed. JR grapples with tough subjects as I mentioned before, but in the end there is growth, survival and self revelation. From Taylor Markham I learned that you have the right to want more in life, but if you do, you need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all your might, and when you have it do the best you can with it. Absolutely beautiful!Finally, a huge thank you and hugs to Alexa that has been trying to get me to read this book since May 2010. Yes, I had the receipt in the book and that\u2019s the time stamp.

That's how long it took me to realize that there was something about this book, even if the first chapters were a bit confusing. But do you know what's the best thing about Jellicoe Road? Reading Jellicoe Road for a second time. You can actually appreciate its magnificence. From the writing, to the characters and the story, they compliment each other beautifully, in a way I haven't read before. This is one of those books that you probably won't find, and when you find them and read them, you know it's going to stay with you for the rest of your life. It's one of a kind, unique, uncommon. This book is placed in a genre where the banalities, concurrent stories, uninteresting; insipid characters, and romanticized unhealthy relationships exist in abundance.

It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d  This was almost a star lower, except for the fact that I could not stop thinking about this book after reading it. That's the mark of a great story.When Taylor is eleven her mother abandons her. At the age of fourteen her only friend betrays her. At the age of seventeen she is selected to be the leader of her school in the annual territory wars versus the Townies and the Cadets. Her mentor Hannah has gone missing leaving Taylor feeling incredibly alone.First off, I want to say I am still a bit conflicted about my rating for one reason. When I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down. But when I put it down.... it remained down until I made myself pick it back up. In the end I binge read the last 200 pages which were excellent. But the confusing beginning definitely took away from the book as a whole. And with the italicized portions, I have a hard time connecting with characters that are from a different perspective unless I know why they matter. Luckily, I knew it would come in, but as a bad reader, I usually skip those parts and I'm glad I didn't.  \u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d  Taylor was such an amazing complex character. She was indecisive but not in an annoying way. It was understandable with all of the shit she went through in her life that it would be difficult to trust and love others for her. Once everything came together in the end, it was easy to see why she was so messed up.But the best part for me? Frickin Jonah Griggs. That boy stole my heart more than once, and his tragic story made my heart bleed for him. He was another character that ended up developing really well by the end and I kind of wish there was another book just so we know his future (not that it's a mystery at the end, it's just open).   \"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way?

I felt like there was so much more we as a reader didn't know. So overall I enjoyed this book. I didn't love it, but I can recognize that it's among the better teen literature out there in the world.

I read this book in 2014 but it is still on my favorite shelves because it was really such a beautifully told and emotional story. If you are interested now is a great time to pick it up.It amazes me the way the Malina Marchette can build and intertwine the lives of the people in her story. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, she makes you care about all of them. Not one of them is perfect, each is flawed and they seem so real that it is hard to remember sometimes you are just in the middle of a story. They all have pasts, presents and futures that are never simple, each is rich and you feel like you know them and that maybe you will carry those people around with you forever.\n\u201cWe were playing Rock, Paper, Scissors,\" she told him once. \"I was paper and she was rock so I lived and she died.\u201d\nSometimes it is as simple as that, one tiny everyday thing will change your life forever. Sometimes one event will bind you to someone or a group of people for the rest of your lives. Jellicoe Road is the story of two such groups of people.The story is told in two parts and although I was a little confused at the beginning it all flushes out beautifully so just ride with it. First there is the story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude and Fitz and how they met and became friends all on the Jellicoe Road. The Second is about Taylor whose mother left her at a 7-11 on the Jellicoe Road seven years ago. Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school and every year for 6 weeks there is a turf war between the Jellicoe School, Town Kids and some Cadets. As the story is revealed little by little you see how everything is connected and you take the journey with Taylor from a girl who was once abandoned, to a girl who finds a home, friends and her place in the world.The writing of the book is so beautiful that I believe I have more marks and highlights in this book than any other I\u2019ve ever read. The story of the 5 kids who met on the Jellicoe road is disastrously beautiful tying in with Taylor\u2019s story \u201cInstinct tells me to go to Hannah's, but she doesn't live there anymore and that's when I realize the major difference between my mother and Hannah. My mother deserted me at the 7-Eleven, hundred of kilometers away from home.Hannah, however, did the unforgivable.She deserted me in our own backyard.\u201dTaylor feels so abandoned and alone, she keeps everyone at a distance because when people get too close that is when she gets hurt the most. That is the lesson her mother taught her. She is so prickly but you honestly want to just protect her character because already at 17 she has been through more than most people go through in a lifetime. As the turf war starts with the Cadet\u2019s and Townies we get to meet a few other characters. Griggs and Taylor have a past of sorts and it seems their journey together might not be over yet. Griggs in a way was just as broken as Taylor, but she helped him in a way she doesn\u2019t even know in a way that will bind them forever.\n\u201cHe stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201d\nEvery character burns so bright and they all have fantastic dialogue that seems so natural. I love Griggs back story and how he and Taylor originally met. I couldn\u2019t stop reading and even though I flushed out how parts of the stories intertwined together there are still plenty of surprises that I did not see coming. I wanted to wrap Taylor and Griggs together in bubble wrap and protect them from the world. I hoped for many of the other characters and their story lines. I was emotional and even characters that I didn\u2019t think I would forgive for the parts they played in the story Marchetta was able to give me a different view and when you see the whole picture I found empathy and understanding for them. This is a book that the words and the characters will really stick with you. That when not if you read it again you will see all the beauty and hope that lives even through tragedy\u201cWhen it was over, she gathered him in her arms. And told him the terrible irony of her life.That she had wanted to be dead all those years while her brother had been alive. That had been her sin.And this was her penance.Wanting to live when everyone else seemed dead.\u201dMarchetta is a master at what many authors try to do but most don\u2019t accomplish.

Her leadership starts just as the territory wars begin with opposing groups, the Townies and the Cadets. Taylor's mind is not focused on the territorial fight to win, for she has discovered that her caregiver Hannah has disappeared without a trace. Taylor is forced, time and again, to deal with the leader of the cadets, Jonah Griggs, and face the history they have together. She must also face the distant memories of her past that are now coming to the surface. But this is just the beginning of the story...Breathtaking, surreal, lyrical, haunting, tragic, and beautiful, this book is truly an art form. When I first started the book, I did find it confusing, but I persevered. Trust me when I say that it will all pay off in the end, as the stories become more clear and the mysteries revealed. There are so many extreme emotions that this book brings out, including grief, and the tragic question as to why every parent is not able to be a healthy, capable, giving parent...they are just trying to survive themselves. The book also inspires such joy and beauty that you can sometimes forget the extreme lows that can happen in life, if just for a short while. The first thing I did when I finished the book was take my almost four year twin boys, and hug them close. My older son was not at home, and will only sometimes let me hug him, only very briefly. The next thing I did was look up some lingering questions I had about the story. I came across a thread that advised that you read this book twice, as there are so many clues and tie-ins that can easily be missed the first time around, and that provide even deeper meaning for the story within a story.

It\u2019s been three and a half years since I\u2019ve first read Jellicoe Road, so it\u2019s about damn time!Aaaaand this book still has a special place in my heart. Content warnings for: suicide, suicide ideation, drug addiction & drug abuse, child neglect, child abuse, death, grief, mentions of pedophilia, domestic violence, cancer, car crashBuddy read with Chelsea, Jen, Anna, Jennifer and Harriet.5 stars!!This book made me feel things I don't think I've ever felt while reading. It made me feel all the emotions. EVERYTHING. Confusion, annoyance, shock, love, awe, sadness, anger, heartbreak, hope.... Everything! I will need a lot of time to get over this book. It snuck up on me when I least expected it, hooked me and never let me go. \nSo why would I want someone to be my everything when one day they might not be around? What will be left of me then?\nWow. This book was so much more than I expected it to be. When I was done, I wanted to start it again because.. just because I needed to experience these feelings again. I can't explain why I loved this book as much as I did, but boy did I love it. \u201cIf you weren't driving, I'd kiss you senseless,\" I tell him.He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly.\"Not driving any more.\u201dI was hooked from page 1 and that was mostly because I was so confused. The beginning of the book just doesn't make any sense not knowing yet what you'll later find out. So it was mostly the mystery that hooked me, the strangeness of the story, and wanting to understand what was going on. I'd be lying though if I said that the mystery, the not knowing what was happening, didn't frustrate me. Because it did. But for some reason it didn't make me stop reading or made me enjoy the read any less. Honestly, my annoyance just fueled my need to keep reading, to figure out the root of this special, confusing story. \n\u201cHold my hand because I might disappear.\u201d\nBecause when I started to understand more and more, it was so worth it for me! This story is just not like anything I've ever read before and I really did love every second of it. The characters are some of my absolute favorites ever. From Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude and Fitz to Taylor, Jonah, Ben, Jessa, Santangelo and Raffy, they are all so special and kind of everything to me. I couldn't get enough of their stories and my heart hurt so much because of what they all had to go through. Their character development was astounding and their dialogue made me laugh and tear up, depending on the topic. I loved every second of it. \u201cHe stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\u201dThere were so many moments that warmed my heart, so many scenes I just had to highlight and I wish I could share every single one with you, but I had to limit myself to only a few, unfortunately. \"Who do you in believe in?\" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. \"I believe in you, Taylor Markham.\"I think one of my favorite characters is actually Raffy. Her constant optimism, her faith and loyalty, especially towards Taylor makes her one of the most amazing friends and I have so much love for her. Now that I think about it, there's some quality in every one of the characters that I could rant and fangirl about, but I'm trying to keep this review at least somewhat short, so just know that I love every single one of them in their own weird way. Ben Cassidy everybody:\"Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face.\"While the beginning was confusing, and huge parts of the middle extremely funny and entertaining, the ending... oh god the ending broke my heart, in the best way possible. Now that I know what was going on in the beginning, I would love to go back and read it again. I'm sure it would be even more heartbreaking to read it (Anna already told me so), but what can I say. I'm a masochist. \"She's the only person who gets away with calling Santangelo a \"little shit\" and once in a while she'll go for the collective and refer to both Griggs and Santangelo as those \"two little shits.\" Most of the time the \"two little shits\" take it on the chin but sometimes Santangelo says, \"I'm fucking out of here,\" and his mom warns, \"Don't you dare swear, you little shit.\"Seriously, this story is so fucking special and just everything.

It is the kind of book that if 5 is the top rating makes me rethink all my other ratings because if this is a 5, I have some 5 star books that might be 3\u2019s. I haven\u2019t been this passionate about a book since Sempre and although I can pimp that book out to a wider range of people, this book has surpassed it as my favorite YA romance book ( not even sure if YA romance is the right description for it). This is a story of friendship, growing up, hurt, love, losing oneself, finding oneself, there is mystery and it is written in such a different way that it keeps you thinking throughout. For me the main outline of a YA book is to build, build, hit you over the head and then in the end start to make you feel heeled. That is not how this book is handled. I would say this book evolves and unfolds. And as things get unfolded the story has a natural progression that doesn\u2019t feel forced and I was just so sucked into. After a certain point in the book I literally had to take it in chunks. I would read and stop and think about it and gather myself, make a status and get back into it and when I got back into the intensity was right where I left it. This is the story of Jellicoe Road. There are 2 stories going on in this book. The story is told from Taylor\u2019s voice and a story from a manuscript that is separated from the main story in italics. (I would not recommend this book to audio readers because of that fact) The main story is told in the voice of Taylor Markham. She goes to the Jellicoe School which is a state school, made up with many state wards and people who want their children educated in the bush. The story is focused around a war game that is played out between the cadets, Jellicoe students and the townies. We\u2019re kind of thrown into the story and it unfolds as it goes so the beginning can be tad confusing until you figure out what is going on. Taylor gets dumped on Jellicoe road by her mother and is raised by Hannah who Taylor suspects didn\u2019t come by her by accident. With her high school years coming to an end the mystery around her mother starts to consume her and she set out for answers. **Idiot Paragraph** Not part of official review. First of all I almost didn\u2019t read this book. I got it from the library and have had so many library books and buddy reads that this book had been getting shuffled aside. I finished a book in work( I work nightshift ) and opened it to see if I was into the voice. I had no idea what the book was about, NONE. I got it because Catie and Tatiana agreed that it was a 5 star book (more my fantasy go tos) that doesn\u2019t happen often. I scan down my list and there is a wider range of people with the same rating. The only part I remember is Catie saying the beginning was a little confusing but she likes figuring things out. **Idiot part** There is writing in italics and they tell you pretty early on that it is a manuscript that Taylor is reading. Wellll I missed it. I\u2019m like 20% in trying to piece together this story, trying to figure out whether it\u2019s a dream or 5 personalities in her head and boy was I down all kinds of paths. I actually went back and had to reskim the first 20% when the confusion in my head got out of hand.This book gave me chills and although I have welled up on 2 books in the past because of the sadness I felt for the characters this was the first book that I actually had a liquid type substance around the area of my eyes from the pure happiness at times. And that feeling wasn\u2019t just at the end like you feel in many novels after you get to the top and you are finally rewarded there were several throughout the story.In the end there is a mystery, love stories, bonds of lifelong friendships and just a great story that I would recommend to anyone except those that have to have sex in their books.

Just me....alone with a majority of people of who LOVED, ADORED, OBSESSED over this particular novel. And oh, dear God please don't hate me (especially you, my dear, sweet Anna) but.....I couldn't love this book. I tried. I tried so, so, SOOOOOO hard, but, in the end, I never once did I feel myself drawn back to this story. When I put the book down, it was just that-I put it down. It didn't exist beyond when it was in my hands. And I know that's not how it's supposed to feel. \"What do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.Gawd, you guys I wanted to love this so hard. As I was tossing and turning on this horrible last Sunday night (the depression of not loving this book was a visceral feeling), I came to a crushing realization: I'd rather be fighting my Sunday night demons (I can NEVER sleep on Sunday nights, but that's neither here nor there...) attempting to sleep even when I knew I couldn't than reading more of this book. And that kept me from sleeping, as well. I repeatedly asked myself, 'What's wrong with me?' 'Why am I the only person who didn't like this?'. And, admittedly, I still hate that I couldn't find much to identify with.Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.I think Marchetta's ideas are so profound, but I just hate how she delivers them. She's lost me in both books I've attempted to read and I think I just need to realize that this author is not for me. It doesn't mean she's not an excellent writer-she is. But, and this is going to sound so harsh, if the only tears I cried were from boredom? There's a problem. Just because a book is beautiful and has poetic writing doesn't mean it can't be boring and....for me....it was boring until like 60%. Even in the end when it was supposed to all tie together, I finally just didn't care. I don't think I would have anyway, honestly. I'm such a bad reader-I really only cared about Jonah and Taylor, and I feel like they hardly had any real, tangible time together.\"What's with what you're wearing?\" Griggs asks while we stand outside waiting for the others.\"It's pretty hideous, isn't it?\" I say.\"Don't force me to look at it,\" he says. \"It's see-through.\"That kills the conversation for a couple of seconds.And, I swear this is the last negative section, that's my biggest problem. Why does there have to be so many people on each page? It's confusing, it made it drag, and I didn't get NEAR enough Jonah...at all. And the territory wars-I'm sorry, but how could this be a main plot point??? It was fun at first, and then I was like...please, please, PLEASE stop-they didn't make sense. Or, I just was too far gone to care...again.Though very little worked for me, there were some shining moments. Jonah. Oh my goodness did I love him. He and Taylor together. All of their moments separate from the school were amazing and fun to follow, but it just took so damn long to get there. I loved the way he looked at her and how he was always so protective of her. How he would do anything to make sure she stayed safe. And, most importantly, how they changed each other's lives forever.\"You care about nothing, you piece of shit!\"I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.\"Never,\" he tells me in a tone full of ice, \"underestimate who or what I care for.\"Okay, so, I've said my piece and it's clear I'm in the minority-it's clear that everyone thinks all the things I hated are what make an excellent story, so don't take my word for it.

Sometimes I save books that I feel like I will love for when I really need them. I thought this book was going to be one of those books that I would love because it is so loved on Goodreads and it sounds so interesting. Instead of loving it, I really disliked it overall and that is because the first 50% is atrocious. I almost marked it as a DNF at 55% because of how bored I was but I powered on and I was able to finish it. I think I've narrowed down the main problems with the first half. First of all, Marchetta makes the whole land war thing really vague and I was so confused as to what it actually was. I mean how hard is it to say its like a game? I was like \"is this a dystopian novel, what the hell is going on?\" at the start. Marchetta also makes the whole thing really confusing with the two different stories and the time jumps and the dreams vs reality aspect. Instead of being mysterious and cool, I thought it was muddled and boring. Also, I guessed how the whole thing connected correctly and so the whole thing was just a waiting game for me and not like this crazy good revelation. Secondly, Taylor was the other main problem in part one. She was like completely self-absorbed and it felt like she didn't really care about the other characters and she was like really separated from everything that happened around her. This created a disconnect between me and her and me and the other characters (because it was all told from her point of view). And its not even like characters like Taylor are the problem, it was just a problem in this particular book. Basically I thought the first 50% was like a really bad mystery novel because the author clearly tried to be mysterious, she kept dangling things in front of the readers without divulging anything meaningful, I guessed what was going to happen because it was so obvious and Taylor wasn't being completely forthcoming with the readers or herself. The second half was literally like reading a completely different book - Taylor completely changed, the whole tone of the book changed, it was clear and concise, I could connect to the characters and I even felt emotional at bits. If the whole book had had those qualities, this could have been a great book but then I guess there would be a lot less pages. I liked bits of the writing. I thought it was quite easy to read and I could see myself liking one of her other books if the story was different. The romance was annoying. So. Much. Angst! I did not ship it. I mean, what solidified me not shipping it was when Jonah pinned her against a wall, lifting her off the ground in a fit of rage. Relationship goals? I think not. Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I'm in the minority though so if you're reading this review and you haven't read the book, you could read it and love it like the rest of my Goodreads friends. I probably would be open to reading more by Melina Marchetta in the future.------------------------------------\"\"I'm the same age my father was when he died,\" she told me. \"I'm older than he will ever be.

Taylor Markham was eleven years old when she was abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road. Now seventeen years old, Taylor is not only the new leader of her boarding school dorm, but she will soon uncover many secrets about her life before she came on Jellicoe Road, especially after her mentor Hannah, suddenly disappears from the school without a word to Taylor. Not only that but Taylor soon meets up with her old sweetheart, Jonah Griggs and she suspects that Jonah knows more about herself then Taylor knows. Now, Taylor must go on a journey to find out the truth about her mother\u2019s abandonment and the whereabouts of Hannah and what she will discover about her true past will change her life forever!Wow\u2026just wow for the umpteenth time. Now, I know that I had mentioned before that I loved reading Saving Francesca and I still love that book, but after reading \u201cJellicoe Road,\u201d I think that \u201cJellicoe Road\u201d is a few leagues above \u201cSaving Francesca\u201d in terms of storytelling and character development. I loved the way that Melina Marchetta build up the mystery surrounding Taylor\u2019s past and how it affects her current state. This was probably the main reason why I loved reading \u201cJellicoe Road\u201d because I was constantly sitting on the edge of my seat every time certain clues were being thrown out regarding Taylor\u2019s past such as why Hannah suddenly left the school and why her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road all those years ago. I also liked the character Taylor Markham herself and even though there were times where her aggressive attitude towards other people annoyed me a bit, I can sort of sympathize with her because of how she finds it hard to trust anyone after her mother abandoned her and Hannah, the closest person she had to a family, suddenly left the school without telling Taylor. I really enjoyed Taylor\u2019s relationship with Jonah Griggs, Raffaela, Ben, and Chaz Santangelo as they are close friends with her and I loved the way that these characters all tried to help Taylor through her trust issues with other people and also, showed her the true meaning of friendship. I really enjoyed the way that Melina Marchetta set this story in Australia since I love reading stories located in other countries and I also loved the way that Melina Marchetta described the Jellicoe Road as being a road where trees sort of hang over the roads, like a canopy and that just gives me a wonderful image about the road every time I read this book!   I really liked the scenes where Taylor was reading Hannah\u2019s manuscripts (the italicized sections of the book) as they tell the stories about the characters Tate, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, and Webb and even though the stories were truly heartbreaking and touching, the significance of the manuscript scenes is definitely something that shocked me after I finished reading this book! For a novel that is aimed at young adults, there is some pretty strong language in this novel including dropping the \u201cf\u201d bomb and the \u201cs\u201d word. If anyone does not like reading strong language in a novel, then it might be best to skim over these scenes. This novel also deals with the subject of child abandonment and anyone who has ever gone through this situation, might find it hard to read through this book.Overall, \u201cJellicoe Road\u201d is a truly emotional and engaging novel that anyone who is a fan of Melina Marchetta\u2019s works or love reading young adult novels about real teenagers dealing with real life will love for many years to come!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog", "num_likes": 26, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["sexy-bad-boy-hero", "ronyell-s-epinions-reviews", "my-blog-reviews", "young-adult-teen-books", "contemporary-romance", "printz-award", "australian-books", "1st-person-pov", "melina-marchetta", "australian-hero-or-heroine"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1235925039", "review_id": "1235925039", "date": "Mar 24, 2015", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Denisse", "user_url": "/user/show/8759700-denisse", "text": "This is a sweet story.

Y solo para lectores pacientes. Por mucho rato, casi la mitad del libro, no vas a saber ni que onda con nada. No sabes que tan en serio es la parte de guerras en las \u201cguerras territoriales\u201d que se hacen en Jellicoe. Y entre eso, las alucinaciones/sue\u00f1os que tiene la protagonista Taylor y los pasajes de los 5 ni\u00f1os que se conocieron ah\u00ed antes de que ella llegara, puede revolver un poco. El libro seria una gran relectura, de hecho.Pero por eso mismo, me pique con la historia. El no saber es algo que me puede mucho. As\u00ed que no solt\u00e9 el libro, casi. Bueno, el kindle whatever. La forma de escribir es lo m\u00e1s interesante, se lee de forma bastante \u00edntima. Muy absorbente, emotiva y divertida cuando era necesario. La autora recurre mucho al mostrar y no decir. En muy pocas ocasiones te toparas con cosas como \u201cTAL persona es en realidad TAL persona\u201d o \u201cTal persona, en realidad si hizo esta TAL cosa\u201d  En lo personal me gusta pero no creo que para un YA sea lo adecuado, o sea no me imagino a alguien de 13-14 a\u00f1os leyendo esto y captando todo lo que haya que captar.

Or maybe they could get away with using \"Wake Up\" in this imaginary movie of the future. My goodreads friends have probably written better reviews of this book than I will write here. I'd recommend reading their reviews. Part of me wanted to give this four stars, just because it's probably kind of a girly book, and because there are a couple of loose ends in the novel that seem kind of forced to tie themselves up nicely. A lot of people I know also love this book, and the contrarian part of me wanted to say, it was good but it wasn't that good. But it is that good, and it's strengths are so strong that they allowed me to overlook the couple of contrived ways of wrapping up the story. And it's not really a girly book at all, but by the packaging of the book I can't see it getting read by that many teenage boys. Actually do teenagers like this book? My couple of goodreads friends who read this whom are close to being teenagers were the people who rated this lowest. It's a fairly complex book for teenagers, like the narrator's personality it's not the friendliest book when you first encounter. It's the kind of book that can infuriate you at the start if you try to hard to make sense of everything that is going on. I didn't worry about this though. Too many friends loved this book, and they weren't all the type that could gush over a Ben Marcus like novel that has no easy way to circumnavigate the text. I trusted that the author would do her job and that when things needed to make sense they would, and they did although it took me about a hundred and fifty pages before I had grasp on who the all the characters backstory were. But, it's nice when books take their time to unfold, I just don't know how much patience kids (teens) would have with it. I like to think I'm wrong though, and teens are better readers than their adult counterparts who whine like babies if a book demands anything more than turning a few pages. I'm floundering more than usual with this review. It's a beautiful and sad book and I'd recommend it, even if I can't write a review that does it any justice.

On the Jellicoe Road is, without a doubt, Melina Marchetta's most profound, heart-wrenching, and ultimately best book. It goes without saying that this woman is a Goddess of Literature. She has an unrivaled command over words, an ability to make even the most stoic hearts melt, and her stories make you see the world in an entirely new light. I cannot give this book or its author enough praise and I cannot write a review that can possibly do justice to this book, but I can try. Most people have that one moment that changes their life forever - Taylor Markham had two. The first was when her mother abandoned her at the age of 11 in a 7-Eleven near Jellicoe Road, the location of a boarding school for children who are neglected or have violent/criminal tendencies. The second was when Hannah, Taylor's mentor, friend, and care-taker, mysteriously abandons her without a word, leaving the school and leaving behind 17-year-old Taylor, who is now in charge of a game of territory wars with the Townies, locals from neighboring towns, and the Cadets, who happen to spend several weeks in the wilderness. Taylor, who isn't even sure that she can handle her new-found role of responsibility, is now forced to become a leader, take on Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets, who happens to know her far better than she'd like simply because they shared a past, and do her best not to worry about Hannah's disappearance which may or may not have something to do with her mother, all while suffering from a recurring dream of a young boy who is desperately trying to tell her something. On the Jellicoe Road is Taylor's story - the tale of her past, her present, the answers to all the unanswered questions in her life, and ultimately, it is a remarkable journey of heart-break, sorrow, and hope. When I first began On the Jellicoe Road I thought I had finally stumbled upon a Marchetta story I wouldn't like. The beginning was good, interesting, and even mildly gripping, but it by no means led me to understand the hype surrounding this novel. I was confused beyond measure by various elements of the plot and I very nearly gave up on it - but then, it started to creep up on me. I had set it down for a few hours to finish some work, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to know what happened. I had to know who the \"Fucked-Up Five\" were. I had to know how their story related to Taylor's. On the Jellicoe Road is not simply the story of Taylor, it is also the story of her entire family, before she even came to be. It is a profound and moving tale that explores topics of far more depth and sorrow than Marchetta has ever explored in the past. It is a story about death, murder, guilt, and depression, but it is also a story of hope, forgiveness, love, and honor. It is a story about finding the people who truly care about you in life and learning to never take what you have - or who you have - for granted. On the Jellicoe Road is told primarily from Taylor\u2019s POV, but it also contains glimpses into the past \u2013 into a friendship that came before Taylor and a love so strong it existed after her. Speaking of love, there is so much of it in this book. Each and every friendship, relationship, and romance was beautiful and touching. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come to care for characters as much as I cared for the cast of On the Jellicoe Road. Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Jude, Hannah, Santangelo, Jessa, Webb\u2026the list goes on and on. There wasn\u2019t a single character I didn\u2019t feel deeply for, a single character for which I didn\u2019t wish utter happiness and didn\u2019t feel their complete despair. There are such few stories in this world that have purposeful characters who are each understood by the reader just as well as the narrator, but On the Jellicoe Road is one of those few books. Although Marchetta is primarily a contemporary YA writer, I am somehow constantly surprised by the depth of her love stories. Her romances are slow to build, taking their time, introducing each character until you are practically dying of anticipation for them to get together and when they finally do, it is so sweet, so perfect, and so human that you cannot help but sob from joy. That is quality and vibrancy of emotion that Marchetta sparks. Jonah Griggs is definitely by favorite Marchetta boy of them all \u2013 I love him more than Will Trombal, more than Tom Mackee, more than Jimmy Hailler, more than Finnikin and Froi, more than any other character I have ever come across. In some ways, his sorrow felt deeper, sadder, and more tangible to me than Taylor\u2019s did and I loved him all the more for it. I loved him for his understanding of Taylor when no one else did. I loved him for being able to read her mind so perfectly. I loved him for his jealousy, his possessiveness, his confidence, his vulnerability, his need to be loved just as much as everyone else. If you take only one thing away from this book, it will most likely be that you need a Jonah Griggs in your life, because I definitely need one in mine. I know my review is vague, but I don't want to say anything more about this story. I didn't know much about it before I began and I would have been terribly upset if I understood the full complexity of this plot before I read it. This is a story that is meant to be read and felt by putting together the pieces yourself and making sense of what it means - not only in the book, but to yourself as well. I feel as if each and every one of Marchetta's novels has a profound impact on her readers, but all in a different and unique way. I myself can't say what it was that affected me so deeply, but Marchetta is able to capture human emotions, human nature, and human feeling so perfectly, that you cannot help but feel the sadness of each character. Sorrow is a feeling that is impossible to describe, yet Marchetta manages to create a story that describes this sorrow and makes it tangible, but not to the point where it crushes it, but to the point where it brings you hope and the strength to overcome your own hurdles and fears in life. Whatever it may be, On the Jellicoe Road is truly inspirational. If Taylor can go through everything she's been through, if her friends and family can suffer through their sorrow and pull through in the end, then so can I, so can you, the reader, so can anyone in the world. This feeling of hope that Marchetta inspires is so palpable that you can feel it blooming inside you long after you have closed the cover of the novel. I can't articulate how perfect this book was, but it was beautiful. Love cannot even come close to summarizing what I feel about this book. It is one that I will treasure and keep close to my heart - always.", "num_likes": 26, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["books-that-linger", "beautiful-prose", "aussie", "swoooon", "teary-eyed-reads", "favorites", "life-changing"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/431806663", "review_id": "431806663", "date": "Oct 10, 2012", "rating": 2, "user_name": "David", "user_url": "/user/show/3335664-david", "text": "I only picked this book because it popped up on PaperbackSwap and I recognized the title as one of those highly-regarded, prize-winning \"literary\" Young Adult novels that are supposed to be life-changing and glorious and moving and representative of the heights of quality to which Young Adult literature can attain.You may gather from this preamble that I was not all that impressed.On the Jellicoe Road isn't a bad book. It's... interesting, if you find it interesting to read about teenagers! Having drama! About fucked-up parents! And secrets! About their past! And there's this one boy! In a tree!Yeah, the boy in a tree is a dream about the main character's father and it's all very symbolic and whatever.So, basically it's a contemporary YA novel about a girl named Taylor who was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven and has grown up at a boarding school. She's now a senior (or a \"Year Twelve\" or whatever they call them in Australia) and has just been put in charge of her house by a shadowy cabal of fellow students, which starts the book off with a lot of adolescent politics and power games leading to the annual \"war\" between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets in which Taylor is supposed to be leader and supreme commander of her Jellicoe kiddies. Mostly she spends the time whining, having asthma attacks, emoting about her tormented past and a mother who evidently suffered from all sorts of drug and mental health issues, and trying to uncover what happened to her father and some other people her parents knew. There's one teacher at the Jellicoe school named Hannah whom Taylor kind of sort of looks up to as a role model, and Hannah suddenly disappears, which ramps up Taylor's abandonment issues to eleventy, and since she's already a teenager and therefore living in a universe from which the gravity of her own self-importance allows no light to escape, she pretty much treats all her friends and the younger children at her school like shit, even though for some inexplicable reason they all look up to her.I didn't like Taylor much. Yeah, she's had some rough breaks. But at the point where she's screaming at eleven-year-olds who have had their own rough breaks, not that this would ever occur to her, I lose most of my sympathy for her.The whole \"territory war\" premise, in which the students, the Townies, and the Cadets wage a mock war complete with rules and treaties and things, all passing under the radar of all the responsible adults, was just a pretext to keep throwing Taylor together with Jonah, the leader of the Cadets, the brooding, dangerous, but secretively sensitive boy with his own tormented past who just needs the healing power of poontang as much as Taylor needs the healing power of peen. At the point where he and Taylor have the inevitable sex, the writing is just short of turgid with lots of \"inside\" and \"oneness\" metaphors and as graphic as a \"literary\" Young Adult novel will allow, so it's mostly about Feelings! And breath! And also kind of painful (for Taylor). Like giving teen readers a little taste of the forbidden apple and trying to make it sound kind of cool and exciting but also a little bit scary and vague, which I suppose is exactly how most teenagers view sex before they've tried it.I can see why teenagers, particular younger ones, would go breathless for this book, but I'm too jaded and also, I have to say, this is a very girly book. By which I mean, Taylor's breathless first-person POV running at a constant high pitch of intense emotionalism is obviously meant to resonate with Taylor's peer group, and all of her actions and concerns and preoccupations, she goes about dealing with in a very teen girl way, which is fine but so outside my mindset that I couldn't relate. This is not a book for me.The writing was pretty good for a YA novel, and the story eventually becomes one of adults hiding secrets (surprise!) which are finally dragged into the light and Taylor and Griggs getting some closure on their hurtful pasts, and everyone essentially having a group hug at the end, though not without a bittersweet denouement. It is possible that, boy or not, I would have really liked this book when I was a teen myself. I'd still probably recommend this book for, you know, people who like this kind of book.", "num_likes": 25, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["contemporary", "female-protagonist", "high-school", "audiobook", "female-author", "young-adult", "teenagers", "australia"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1350365563", "review_id": "1350365563", "date": "Jul 30, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Anne ", "user_url": "/user/show/23304719-anne", "text": " OH.MY.GOD.OPEN UP THE FLOOD GATES.THIS BOOK WAS/IS AMAZING.I JUST WANT TO CURL UP IN FETAL POSITION IN MY LITTLE CORNER AND NOT THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE \n\nI live on the JELLICOE ROAD.

The Jellicoe was so beautifully captured, it seemed almost as if it was a totally different world of it's own--rather than in Australia. I mean, I would escape to the Jellicoe if I could.

Why did I read this just now? I bought my copy a long time ago upon recommendation of people I thought my friends. If said people are real friends, they wouldn\u2019t just recommend it, they should have tied me in a chair and forced me to read this. I reckon they don\u2019t have to tie me in that chair too long because it only took a couple of pages before I fell in love with this amazing book. I frequently tell people that if only I could I would marry Paper Towns, but that has changed now. Paper Towns would be better off with Jellicoe Road and they will make wonderful, wonderful babies together. I should stop being a smartypants now and get on with it already. I want to bottle this moment, this feeling I have after reading Jellicoe Road and what better way to do that than writing about it?For the first time since I started blogging, I won\u2019t try to write my own summary of the book I\u2019m reviewing. I simply cannot do it. The summary at the back tells us that it is a story about a girl named Taylor Markham, five teenagers in the past, and a road where it all happened. But there\u2019s more to this book than that. Although we spend more than half of the time inside Taylor\u2019s head, Jellicoe Road is a lot bigger than Taylor\u2019s search for some sense of home and security. As the synopsis suggest, it is also about those five teenagers \u2014 Narnie, Web, Tate, Fitz and Jude \u2014 bonded by a freak accident that happened 22 years in the past. It\u2019s a story of how their friendship help one another withstand the despair that is eating them. It\u2019s also about Jonah Griggs, a boy who is scarred for life and the story of how he was saved from self-destruction. It is also about Rafaella and Santagello\u2019s friendship and missed opportunities; and of Jessa\u2019s wild innocence; and of Ben\u2019s music and loyalty. Jellicoe Road is a book that is filled to the brim with genuinely sympathetic and nuanced characters. All of them are dear to me. I desired nothing but to step into the book and give each a hug \u2014 a hug that is not much of me comforting them but them reassuring me that they are going to be okay. I wanted to belong. Long to be. It\u2019s a beautiful tale about loss, grief, and pain and at the same time of love, friendship and hope. I am in awe at how Ms. Melina Marchetta managed to do all this under 330 pages.I know a lot of people say that the first half of the book was like a puzzle and way too confusing for its own good. Don\u2019t get intimidated by that. There were tell-tale hints about how the two narratives come together, and I figured out in ways more than one the connection early on the story. I don\u2019t mean to gloat. What I mean is that it is not rocket science and it is still well within the capabilities of an ordinary human mind. I figured it out and I don\u2019t know how to tell you how that\u2019s necessarily a bad thing. I knew it and I felt that Taylor also knew it and only seeks for confirmation \u2014 waiting for someone to tell us that it\u2019s all real. Somehow that knowing makes the journey more painful and more lovely.There were laughters shared and tears shed on the Jellicoe Road. There were mistakes made and forgiveness given. There was acceptance. There were tragedies and love stories. There were dreams shattered and dreams built. There was hope. I am thankful to Melina Marchetta for the opportunity to be part of those.

One of the busiest months I ever had where I\u2019d become a walking robot because of the workloads I had. I was eager to read this book because most of my bookish friends raved about it, and I\u2019m glad I was able to start reading with this book. I remember asking, \u201cWhat is waiting for me ahead of this story?\u201d, and they said, \u201cRollie, my friend, when you go there, you\u2019ll see,\u201d and that was the last phrase I want to hear from them.Yes, I was eager to read this book not just because I required myself to read this, for this is our Book Club\u2019s book of the month, but because this book was scheduled to be read in February this year. Since this book won the poll to be our book for this month\u2014May\u2014I really waited for the right time to come for me to read this book.Confusing? I agree. The first half of the book was supplemented with consistent clueless information that readers couldn\u2019t make out the sense. I believe to what they said that the whole story is as if a jigsaw puzzle. Looking at it at the very first place, you\u2019ll get confused. As the story goes on, the pattern to get the puzzle whole is gradually revealing. I liked how the italic letters affect how I visualized the situations presented. Further, I admire the author at how the manuscript written in a way that it differs a lot to the other narration. The moods of two narrations are way different that they both clung to their respective generations. I liked also how Marchetta becomes picky of words and finicky of sentence constructions in order for her to present well the emotion she intended. To say I cried is an overstatement. I was just saddened at how the past story ended up. I accidentally attached myself to the friendship since I could relate the situation. The difference was just I consider their friendship perfect and filled with love. The group wasn\u2019t just a circle of friends but it became their own home. The group has become their own family. Sad to realize is that they were created through accident, yet they were destroyed through accident. I couldn\u2019t help but hope for Taylor to have a father alive since there was no concrete confirmation of what happened until the epilogue justified. If there\u2019s a scene I loved the most, it\u2019s the last\u2014epilogue. In that scene, I saw a picture of love, happiness, dream and fulfillment. Right in that moment when he saw Fitz innocence occurred, tragic it appealed but pure happiness was underneath.If there\u2019s one person I empathized the most, it\u2019s Hermit. I could see the weight of his burden since the accident. I could feel his guilt that he wasn\u2019t able to control it up. I could understand his hunger for forgiveness from the dead who wouldn\u2019t give it to him already. I feel empathy for him for spending a very happy day with Taylor and end his self with a gun just as he thought his burden was gone.If there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t like much about this book, it\u2019s how the Taylor\u2019s story became dull.

With a lampshade sitting on my side and a long pillow sleeping in the other, this is the night that will fulfill my dream, my dream to visit the well-known Jellicoe Road. The prettiest among the roads without walking, just a simple stare and a very long read. Silence. I can hear the laughs of the children and the memories, ready to burst in a second, written in the cold stones for years. The history is ready and the skirmish, begin!Jellicoe Road, written by an Asutralian author Melina Marchetta, is my first book from her best and well-known works for years. It was a pity that I never touched her books in the past and somebody should pull me around and feed me her book just to read it, and it was great! I can't believe it, reading Melina Marchetta is an exciting new experience. Something everyone will enjoy or not, somehow the target of the book is straight to your heart.I would like to thank Aaron for sharing this book with everyone and to his great F2F discussion last Saturday (May 20, 2012). The laser tag was fun and I would like to give another round but my breath is chocking me in my neck but in the end, I did not make it. I would like to discuss the book with others but in the simplest way, I write a review for everyone to understand why I gave this book three stars and also thanks to Jzhun for sharing his insights but the night left me hang forever.\n[image error]The TFG (The Filipino Group) peeps were running away from zombies inside a dark neon-colored room with laser guns to kill those fuck up creatures. Kidding. The peeps were just having fun tagging each other and the winner is, ugh, the Red team (not my team). Guys, we'll do better next time! Aja!Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven years old and when she was fourteen, she tried to escape the boarding school to search for her mom in Sydney, but the attempt was failed and met the guy of her life. At seventeen, she was pointed as the head of the underground community; she will lead her team to an annual territory game with the Cadets and the Townies. But when she is in need of someone in her life, Hannah (her guardian) was lost and the clues left behind will lead her to the history of the skirmish game and will change her future forever.When I first read the first chapter of the book, which is a very long introduction besides the very short heartwarming prologue, I was so confused that I wanted to put the book down from my hand but my instinct keep me from reading it or maybe I was so frightened not to finish the book on time. The first chapter will first lead you to Taylor assigned as the leader of the underground community in in the boarding school to lead the territory war among the Townies, Cadets and them. Because Marchetta only spilled small amount of facts regarding the territory war or the skirmish and the school terminologies because I'm not used to Australian educational system, the readers will find it a bit confusing, no, very confusing, that in fact few of the TFGs in the past who attempted to read it put it down as early as Marchetta will spill the bucket of facts in the middle of the book. Well, only the courageous one can finish Jellicoe Road and will wash himself from Marchetta's magnum revelations.The manuscript, which is another story of a group of friends in the old town and written by Hannah, Taylor's guardian, was another cool element of the story and a friend of mine, Aaron, site it as the \"dual narrative\" (a good blog post from Guy Gone Geek about The Duality of a Narrative.) Dual narrative is another effective technique to show the story of two different characters, places or period and usually tell the story in two different perspectives. The Manuscript gone mad and it was the mystery in the two point of views that made me connect the dots from the first page to the last. Well, it was predictable and I find it a little bit disappointing; because I want the mystery will not reveal itself until the epilogue of the book or maybe I expected a lot from Marchetta. Maybe some, the dual narrative may find it a work of another genius, for me, it's just another technique that other authors mastered.Lately, I have this close connection between the main characters of the books I read. And I hate the most about Taylor is when she whine because her life sucks! Yeah, there are those when she keeps on whining and repeating her problems from her head and blame others of putting her into that state. From that, she pointed out other characters as that and other these to confuse readers. Unfortunately, in my case, I'm not and I stuck to my own idea of who was that and who were these. This kind of character might be an effective one, but this kind of character annoys me a lot or maybe her hormones should be blame here. The capital S part is quiet disappointing, it's too short to be good like they are just doing it because of heat, maybe. There is no love that night but purely physical. I love her, because she acted like a strong mother to others.But what I love most in the book is the setting of the story. Was it real or not? I'm just a curious lad who really wanted to visit Jellicoe Road. Whether fictional or not, the setting of the book made me jump with over excitement that I though I'm walking into the forest, where branches are lying to each other making a canopy. It's like heaven on Earth, a shangri-la itself! I missed my place, I lived in a small town before and those branches, well, they really exist and the view, well, it's another real issue. Other than that, I also manage to observe that each ending of each chapter had a heartwarming touch of sadness. It's a good motive to continue my reading, I feel solace.Reading Jellicoe Road, well, it was like how the Sydney Morning Herald said:\n\"Melina Marchetta has a knack for writing stories that swallow you up and refuse to let you go until you've read every last word.\"You don't have to pick most of the positive sides of the book, it's just that the book already push you into reading even not liking it as much as your friends does and not knowing the possible reasons why.\n[image error]I love those cookies! Who baked those? I think I ate the Hermit's place. It was amazing anyway, even though it smelled swampy with grassy texture (I think I read swamp next to the Hermit's name). By the way, Taylor (DC) or maybe Jessa, what are you doing there? I can't even enumerate those Houses except Darlings.I read the book slowly so that I can answer the discussion's questions and because of my hope to attend the discussion early, I was so disappointed that I'm late, no, I missed the whole discussion. Overall, I like the Jellicoe Road and I will always treasure it even I find other Marchetta's works better. This will always reminds me of you, the wicked in the outside but nice in the inside. It's like exchanging those songs but I use books to describe you and super thanks for sharing such nice song for me.

For many, many pages I didn't know about the 3 perspective thing (dream/present/past) and there were so many characters and I felt so lost, but the writing was so good and kept me reading so I don't regret even that part. Then I understood and there were things that I even knew before the character found about them, but there were plenty of other surprises too so it didn't feel that predicable at all.Some say that this book changed their world, I won't lie, it didn't, not for me, but it was a really good book and it deserves even more than 5 stars.\n\nThere is drama on so many levels: \"My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. I counted.\"But there is also love: \"If you weren't driving, I'd kiss you senseless,\" I tell him. He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly. \"Not driving anymore.\" There are some funny moments: \"Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.\" \"It's Taylor's middle name\" And there are some thoughtful ones: \"And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.\" Sometimes it's all heartbreaking : \"Do you think I don't want him to be gone more than you do? I do. Because I need to know that I can still breathe properly when he's not around. If something happens to him, I have to know that I won't fall apart [...]\"And sometimes it all feels as casual as your own story: \"Girls under the age of fourteen are the most frightening creatures I have ever come across\"And at the end it makes you think about it all over again: \"Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\" Wow... just wow..\n\nThis review can be found at ReadingAfterMidnight.com____________________________________________Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO)____________________________________________", "num_likes": 23, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["aussie-and-nz", "death-and-dying", "favorites", "standalone", "best-of", "great-books", "sweet-romance", "beloved", "rereading-material"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/160924522", "review_id": "160924522", "date": "Apr 13, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Eh?Eh!", "user_url": "/user/show/137273-eh-eh", "text": "I don't know how to pick apart the mechanics of writing so I'm not sure how she does it.

I'm not good at the literary but YA provides steps instead of a sheer cliff face so it slowly guides me to something, something I can believe without losing me. Marchetta is terrific at this. The stories of two groups of friends, 22 years apart, are interwoven. The setting is at a boarding school, I think open to all and including gifted but troubled orphans. There's connection between the groups and mysteries. I love the humor and I can see Marchetta has this one gag she keeps using, but I'm easy so it works on me every time.Here's where I go off-track. My parents didn't pack me off to summer camps to build character, learn crafts, experience, get rid of me, or whatever reasons people have. The one time I had to go, I was 19 and forced to accompany a 14 year old Korean 2nd cousin who didn't speak much English. Her parents thought an American summer camp would make her practice language skills and build character and experience. I resented her hugely, packed away with her and bunch of 8 to 13 year olds for about 2 weeks. I was even older than the counselors, who ranged from 15 to 17. I don't recall a single adult although they were in nearby cabins. I hadn't camped much so I didn't pack the right clothes or, uh, lady supplies. I was at the height of my nerdy, sweaty, uncomfortable-with-everything, acne-covered, big-t-shirts-with-animals-wearing, big-'90's-glasses, boys-are-scary, I-just-wanna-read phase. It was a terrible, terrible, terrible camp for both of us.But as I read this book, I remember this one awful and lonely time, when I realized that she and I were in the same boat and stopped hating her (so much). There was one evening, after dinner, we were sitting outside during a free hour, and my poor 2nd cousin was sitting apart, unable to participate in the swift and slangy chatter. I was sitting next to her and I nudged her when the others began clumping up for what was obviously turning into one of those bonding conversations. She yanked herself away and glared at me, and unable to suppress it after about a week of tolerating my situation for her sake, I snapped back at her. Oh man. I regretted it immediately but was confused by the mix of anger and shame, unable to choose which one to go with. We sat in silence for a few minutes. The sun was beginning its slow set through the trees and casting long shadows on the slopes where we were sitting after dinner and the girls in our cabin gathered around the 2 female counselors to ask about boys and \"going down\" (because camp is apparently where you learn all these things) and shrieking as one of the counselors held up a crooked pinky and considered it with narrowed eyes that denoted a real attempt to recall, and I should end this run on. I remember envying those 8-13yos, and the counselors who had started out as young campers only to return year after year. They laughed, played, fought, made up, made friends...they were golden. They belonged. I remember laughing a little at the pinky, hiding my horror that the 14yo counselor had experience in these things and I did not. My poor, reviled 2nd cousin turned to me and offered a broken English apology, with eye contact even. Ouch. It struck me that we belonged together, as those golden campers belonged together.Damn you, and thank you, Marchetta, for making me remember that.", "num_likes": 23, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["babble-added", "ah-ree-ell"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/119873682", "review_id": "119873682", "date": "Sep 03, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Isamlq", "user_url": "/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "text": "Let me start with what's important: I want a Griggs.

I\u2019m having such a hard time putting this review into words because nothing will do it justice. I think I\u2019m just left to gush. This is one of my all-time favorite books! Melina Marchetta has a way of writing that is so profound without being wordy or pretentious. She sucks you into the character making you feel you are taking this journey of discovery right along with Taylor. Melina brilliantly reveals the mystery behind all these broken people, gradually, and you are riveted as you read along. Some of this story is shocking and heart-breaking but other parts are hysterically funny and very sweet. The romance between Taylor and Jonah *sigh* is amazing (I think I\u2019m going to say amazing far too many times in this review, sorry!), heart-warming, tender, and sweet!In the beginning of the story, Taylor doesn\u2019t want to let anyone in but you see her growth through the novel, and how she starts to rely on other people as well, to give her love and strength. This is such an emotional story, in a good way. I was crying, laughing, and then crying again, both happy and sad tears! With that said, this was not a depressing book at all but more of a life affirming story. It\u2019s definitely a story I will be reading again and again!

He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly. \u201cNot driving any more.\u201d\u201cSo are you going to tell your mother about me?\u201d I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll probably mention that I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cOnly you would say that in such a I-think-I\u2019ll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.\u201d\u201cStrange that you\u2019re hanging out with Santangelo,\u201d I say. \u201cStrange?

But I'll tell you this for free: my cry-holes got leaky during the last fifty pages or so. Yeah, you read that right. I. Cried. And the author didn't have to stoop to throwing some insane manipulative twist at me. She's just that good at writing. Her story came together beautifully for me and I am thoroughly satisfied. This book deserves all sorts of awards.I will say that I spent the first fifty pages or so wondering what the hell was going on because I was dumb enough to assume the prologue was from the main character's POV. Then I looked back and saw that the incident that happened in the prologue happened twenty-two years before chapter one. Our main character is seventeen years old. So, yeah--not the same person. Just keep that in mind when you pick this book up. Also, you might want to write down the names of the characters mentioned in Hannah's manuscript--who's related to who and whatnot. It makes it much easier to keep track of the story within the story.Anyway, I love this book. I'm going to start recommending it to anyone who asks. Soooo...read this book. Now. P.S. I'll probably post a much better review of Jellicoe Road when I get home. Which won't be for a few weeks or so.

That's what Jellicoe Road was for me. My friend recommended it to me because we were talking about books that changed our lives. I told her mine was Stolen and she told me this was hers, so I decided to read it. When something means a lot to my friends I try it out. The book is a puzzle from page one. There are two stories and you need to know how they go together and if they even do. that's what kept me reading. While the main beginning of the book was quite uninteresting, once I passed 50 pages and the story started, the beginning made complete sense. As slow as the beginning is, the book wouldn't be the same without it. The writing in the book is beyond beautiful, there is no way to really describe it. The book is so vividly etched into my mind, even though there isn't actually much imagery or anything. She focuses on story and character and it pays off. The characters are perfect. Written to be flawed and mysterious and heartbreaking and they all have so much character development that at the end you feel like you've grown with them. I have so much to say about this book, none of it coherent or useful, so I'm going to end this here by saying that I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking and I feel different than I did when I started this book and these are the most important books to cherish because they make you feel something.

This book made me feel: All the emotions.Jellicoe Road was my first Marchetta novel - though this is an author highly touted and often recommended, I was strangely hesitant to read any of her books. Example? I bought Marchetta's acclaimed ya fantasy Finnikin of the Rock for Nook over two months ago, when it was on sale for $2.99, and haven't yet peeked at a page. Hype is often a double-edged sword, as many other anticipated YA novels can attest and I didn't want to feel the sting of disappointment here. I have to say that the first 50 pages of Jellicoe certainly intriiigued me, but they didn't quite convince me as I had hoped. I can certainly see why some readers find the beginning off-putting and hard to comprehend initially, but even after the dual narrative of past and present were cleared up, I just didn't get It, the Big Deal about this book and this author. Then, near about 100 pages later and a \"save yourself, Taylor,\" I got it in a big way. This book made me Feel Things. All of the feelings really: happiness, amusement, sorrow, anger, fear, love. I'm stuck with the feeling that no matter how much I edit and revise and rethink, I will never be able to do this beautiful novel justice. As soon as I finished this, I knew I didn't want to think about other characters, other stories. I wanted to stay here, in Jellicoe, with these characters. So I did the only thing that made sense and flipped the book over and immediately began rereading all my favorite parts. It still packs a punch the second time around, even knowing explicitly what will happen.I grabbed this on a whim three days ago, having been close to finishing the excruciatingly emotional Code Name Verity but with 100 pages and hours of work to go, I opted for a longer novel that hopefully wouldn't make me cry at work. How wrong I was; tears were streaming down by my lunch break (aka p. 255) I engulfed this absorbing, heart-breaking tale in just over twelve hours, covering work and family dinner, starting just before I left at 9 am, sneaking in pages whenever - wherever - I could. Melina Marchetta is the real deal: an imitable and simple but striking style, a masterful storyteller with impressive authorial sleight-of-hand, capable of rendering complex, fallible and damaged characters I still wholly and completely loved. This novel is a masterpiece of young-adult fiction (the 'territory war' was obviously the weakest part of the novel, but it brought together the core four [Taylor, Santangelo, Raffaela, Griggs] initially and eventually was revealed to have a larger purpose) and Melina Marchetta deserves all the accolades she's garnered. As the lovely Emily May so aptly put it: \"[She] plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar.\" Skillfully, elegantly, and above all subtly, Marchetta takes utmost time and care with crafting both her storylines and her compellingly damaged and so so real characters.And let me tell you: oh boy, did I ever care about Taylor, Jonah, Jude, Hannah, Tate, Jessa, Webb, etc. While it took a while for these many personalities to manifest, I think this might one of my most beloved ensembles. From Jonah to Jude, these characters are real, vibrant, and dear to me. Jonah Griggs: I officially Get It. I officially Want One of My Own. Everyone take note for in Jellicoe Road, with Melina's hand at the wheel, there is an authentic, believable and touching YA romance with a swoon-worthy broody love-interest. I don't go in for broody as much now that I'm not 17 and I certainly don't say \"swoon-worthy\" as a descriptor for men I like, but Jonah Griggs defies that. He is broody and swoon-worthy, but that's not all he is. Like Taylor and Jude (Oh, Jude <3. I think he broke my heart as much as Griggs did.) this damaged young-man is developed and rounded. The scenes between him and Taylor - fighting, teasing, loving - all have electricity, a palpable tension, and their relationship is one of the few credible romances in YA. Jellicoe Road is moving, powerful and dramatic without being emotionally manipulative - when Taylor lashes out at whoever is convenient (not my Griggs!), I feel for her wild pain instead of rolling my eyes at her melodrama. Most of the characters have significant tragedies in their pasts, especially Taylor and Jonah, but this is an author that appreciates retraint and how to show emotion without overdoing it and making it a Production. I finished this novel nothing if not in awe of the talent shown throughout from the author - from plot development to character reveals, this is one of the best.Before, I was scared to read Marchetta because I feared she/the novel wouldn't live up to expectations. Now I just don't know where to start - I've ordered hardback copies of Finnikin, its sequel Froi of the Exiles, and Saving Francesca. I just can't do this novel justice - whatever I say feels inadequate. This book moved me, like The Book Thief did - at my core, in a place few novels and characters truly reach. I said before that Melina Marchetta could have been a victim of the hype machine but now all I want to do is force all my family and friends to read her novels. I've decided that the hype around this author and this book isn't big enough yet - everyone should be reading this author. Jellicoe Road is a gripping read, one that inspired a wide, fully-felt spectrum of emotions and reactions - all of them complimentary. I love this book like I love few others.My reactions by page, because by 250 I couldn't think critically, I could just fangirl absorb the words as fast as my eyes would move and jot down impressions/thoughts: p. 250: Oh my god. I <3 Jonah p. 255: WTF! NO! What! Yass! p. 297: I want a Griggs. p. 304: This is heart-breaking, gut-wrenching and still so lovely. This book... \"Who will be my memory\" I can't.... this book... p. 315: Could he be any more adorable? p. 343: And THAT, ladies and gents, is how you write a credible, romantic teenage relationship. p. 371: oh no oh no oh no I think I know where this is headed oh no p. 394: damn right you better keep Raffy around - the rare female sidekick that is fully developed and awesome p. 399 and on: tears p. 407: Griggs. p. 416: I love the narrative structure, the symmetry.

Even more powerful the second time around.***Merely thinking about Jellicoe Road makes my thoughts scatter and unorganized, so in order to convey my thoughts effectively, I must make a list. Hopefully I\u2019ll give Jellicoe Road at least a fraction of the praise it deserves.7 Reasons to Read Jellicoe Road:1- \nThe Writing.\n Enticing, captivating, and dripping with emotion. That\u2019s all I can say. \n\u201cMy body becomes a raft and there's this part of me that wants just literally to go with the flow. To close my eyes and let it take me. But I know sooner or later I will have to get out, that I need to feel the earth beneath my feet, between my toes - the splinters, the bindi-eyes, the burning sensation of hot dirt, the sting of cuts, the twigs, the bites, the heat, the discomfort, the everything. I need desperately to feel it all, so when something wonderful happens, the contrast will be so massive that I will bottle the impact and keep it for the rest of my life.\u201d\n2- \nThe Mystery.\nI\u2019m pretty sure everyone was confused for the first third of the book. I am no exception to that. I did get frustrated; I was feeling a bit impatient. I didn\u2019t appreciate the genius behind the slowly unraveling storyline until I had finished the book. In the end, it all came together, and for the element of mystery Marchetta used, I am grateful.\n\u201cWhatever is now covered up will be uncovered and every secret will be made known.\u201d \n3- \nThe love, the pain, the hope, and everything in between.\n What I find most incredible about Jellicoe Road? Even through all the hardships, all the pain they were forced to endure, a small wisp of emotion was sneaking out of the pages, resonating: hope. 4- \n You will fall in love with each and every character.\n Days after finishing the book, I still tear up thinking about the masterfully well-written characters. The characterization is so superb, near flawless, to the point where you feel like have known the characters for your whole life. That is the impact her characters have on me. 5- \n Jellicoe Road will affect your life, whether you\u2019re a teen or not.\n This book has some powerful messages about friendships and relationships. It will not only affect the lives of adolescents, but also the lives of adults. It will open your eyes.\n \u201cIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\u201d\n 6- \nTAYLOR AND JONAH.\n I don\u2019t recall ever being as enamored as I am with Taylor and Jonah with any other fictional couple. And you know what? They don\u2019t have the healthiest relationship. It is realistically flawed. No matter what they did to each other, no matter what they said, their love was ubiquitous. I don\u2019t care how cheesy that sounds.\n\u201cI shrug. \"I'll probably mention that I'm in love with you.\"He chuckles. \"Only you would say that in such a I-think-I'll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.\u201d\n7- \nJellicoe Road expertly chronicles the journey that is known as adolescence.\n I\u2019ll get this out of the way: being a teen sucks. I would know, as I am at that stage of my life currently. As a result, this book had a massive impact on me. I could relate to everything Taylor thought and said. Her internal monologues were at times hilarious, and at others, made me choke up in tears from her truthfulness. How Marchetta captures the voice of a teen authentically and effortlessly will never cease to amaze me. Seriously, this book should be required reading for ALL teens. Melina Marchetta, you have officially converted me. Prior to reading Jellicoe Road, I could care less about realistic fiction. I was more of a fantasy type of gal. Now, after being exposed to this masterpiece, my eyes have been opened.Reading through my favorite quotes is making me nostalgic.

Too many emotions in one sitting. I just find myself rooting for Taylor to find her mother and Hannah and all about the Fucked-Up Five's (just quoting Fitz and Jude's words) story.I'm impressed that the author didn't bore me with the manuscripts. She only write them once, I suppose, in every other chapter and didn't take any more than two pages. But as the story progresses, I find myself drawn to the 'Fucked-Up Five'. Especially to Webb. I personally adore Taylor. She's fierce and sweet at the same time. She's everything I want in a herione. Griggs dear is.. well.. Griggs. Short-tempered. Sweet. Santangelo was my first crush in this story. *giggles* But he's better off with Raffy. And there's Jessa, the young and full of energy girl. With a scarced past. And then the band composed of Ben, Choi and the Mullets brothers is definitely a win.Romance. It's all in the air but it never diverts the story from us. It's basically intertwined with the story.I'm left speechless after reading the last sentence because the author, in some freaking way only I seemed to decode, assured me that from that day onwards, everything will be okay. Not everything eveything. Just ... everything.5 stars. Definitely a must-read.I laughed out loud at this part.I look at him, shaking my head.\"No chance. It'd be like cutting off our hands.\"\"Then learn to live without your hands.\"\"No, because then we won't be able to do this,\" Ben says, giving him the finger.You're the man, Ben!And, of course, nobody can't not laugh at the Cadets first attempt of invading Jellicoe School's territory.

Using a sentence from the book that sums up this story, for me: \"I remember love.\" Too simple? It's powerful, multi-faceted and complex, actually, just like love... and life... is. I was swept away on the journey with Taylor and the others, and I cried for what they lost and found. In the end, out of the tragedies and hardships of life, I was left with a feeling of love, hope and wonder, that I, along with the characters, discovered... on the Jellicoe Road. LOVED it! Granted, it was a bit confusing in the beginning, with the story shifting between a different cast of characters, at different times. But then, the pieces started falling into place and once I reached the end, I just thought, with tears in my eyes and my heart overflowing: \"What an amazing story!\" I won't go into the plot as this is a story that one just has to discover in all its layers and complexities as it unfolds. Melina Marchetta, an Aussie author and former teacher, is one of my favourite YA authors. Her characters feel so real and the emotions she portrays are so genuine and raw that her books are all special to me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and totally deserving of all the YA literature awards it won, in my humble opinion!\nOn the Jellicoe Road\n has one of the most powerful (and tragic) openings I have ever read:\"My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?\u201d and my father said, \u201cNarnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn\u2019t tell where one began and the other ended.

On my \"all time favorites\" lies \"On the Jellicoe Road\" by\u00a0Melina Marchetta, because her style is amazing and the way she drafted this story was unbelievable, simply bleowing me away. Her storytelling is lyrical, genuine and clean, with a very different approach VS the other authors I've encountered so far.\u00a0Taylor Markham, 17, lives on the Jellicoe Road, in a boarding school. She was abandoned 6 years ago by her mom and found in a restaurant by Hannah, who took her in. They became best friends and she was the only person in front of whom Taylor could be herself, without fears or concerns. When Hannah abruptly disappears, she is extremely worried and goes in search for her. This is basically the main plot, but besides that we also have \"mini\" ones like the territory battles between the kids from Taylor's institution or the love story between her and Jonah, the leader of one of the rival teams, a very lovable character, that will spice up the story. The focus is not very much on the love story, the reader has to be aware of the initiation journey that will make the characters more mature.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know where to begin with the parts I loved. Firstly, the characters are amazing and extremely complex, because they just seem to get better and better as the story progresses. Taylor is something else, because even of her background, she grew up extremely well. As expected, she is complex and difficult to figure out, because after being abandoned, she is guarded and cautious. She is very determined, with a specific sense of humor, very ironic, but smart and witty. Taylor is the leader of the kids from the Jellicoe institution, but she is not in her element, because she doesn't want to stand out, to be noticed. She likes to live quietly, in her own world, but the circumstances will force her to be brave, to go out of her comfort zone and go in search for Hannh, because she needs her friend back.\u00a0Second, Melina's style is nothing like I've ever read, such a lyrical book, beautifully told and not easy to read. All the elements from the book are tied together and every connection made is sooooo smart, so well blended. There are 2 perspectives, past and present, that until the end of the book will go full circle and the reader will put all the pieces together and see how well they click.\u00a0Last, but not least, what the reader goes through while reading the book is not easy, but extremely special. The action is very realistic for a fictional read, but so level headed and raw. Melina \"played\" with a lot of themes, like love, love for your close ones, family, colleagues, friends, for yourself! She also focuses on more uglier things like murders, abuse, disappearances, accidents, that open your eyes and shows you the cruel reality. I repeat, even if the story is fictional, the feelings are real and make you so aware of your surroundings and reality you live in. Don't open this book if you believe the action and plot will be sugar coated, but I guarantee you will not regret it, because the message is so strong, you won't forget it so easily.\u00a0\u00a0I gladly recommend \"On the Jellicoe Road\" because this is not your typical YA book. The characters, the plot and everything in between are special and different. Dive in the story open minded and just open your heart to this amazing characters that won my heart irrevocably.\u00a05 stars!", "num_likes": 20, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favorites", "something-new", "young-adult", "terribly-sad"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/588254752", "review_id": "588254752", "date": "Apr 11, 2013", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Merna ", "user_url": "/user/show/16392157-merna", "text": "Aussie novels.I\u2019ve never read one or more accurately finished one.

Essentially, I ought to have by now given that I'm Australian. Yeah, it's strange that I haven't read many or any.Okay, now the actual review. \"It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.\"On the Jellicoe road is about Taylor Lily Markham, who at the age of 11 was abandoned by her mother at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe road. Her only memory of her previous life is standing on her father\u2019s shoulder. Hannah is her only guardian who lives in the unfinished house by the river, and writes stories about five kids who lived there back in the 1980s. Taylor is a part of territory war between the cadets (Sydney boys who come for training every six weeks a year) and the townies (kids from Jellicoe town).The beginning was faintly confusing, but after 100 pages I finally put some of the pieces together. I won\u2019t go into the minor confusion I had experienced in the book, because I believe on the Jellicoe road should be read without much information of the backstory. It will take some time until you start understanding what\u2019s going on, nonetheless you will have an enjoyable time attempting to solve the mystery as you\u2019re reading, right before you start crying at the end. After 200 pages the book does become immensely predictable, however it wasn\u2019t any less entertaining. I\u2019m not certain if I liked Taylor. At times I despised her, and felt her i-don\u2019t-give-a-shit attitude should not simply be excused considering her tough past. At the end I worked out my conflicted feelings with Taylor and saw her in a more of a positive light. The love interest - Jonah Griggs is the leader of the cadets, and is viewed frequently as the \u2018dark and tortured\u2019 type. Taylor and Jonah have this heartbreaking and complicated history. There was no insta-love or drooling over each other like crazy in their relationship, thankfully. Anyway, I gladly recommend this book to everyone.

What a gem of a book!It's a very emotional story and at times painful to read because you see these characters that are good people make horrible decisions and become so lost that they don't even know who they are anymore. It's a story about loss, lonliness, death and guilt and all you wish for is that the characters get the happy ending they deserve.Melina Marchetta's writing is superb; she uses metaphors and similes in a way that is never jarring and really creates atmosphere. After reading On the Jellicoe Road I immidiatly want to pick up Marchetta's other books because this novel has instilled a kind of trust in me. I feel like I would love whatever she writes. The way she deals with such serious topics and still manages to make me laugh with her dry humour and sarcasm is fantastic. I loved the characters in this story. Taylor, our protagonist, is a 17-year-old girl who has been abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven. Since then, she hasn't seen her mother or father and feels like she can't trust anyone and that nobody in the world loves her. I feel like characters such as Taylor are very difficult to write because they can be very moody, depressed and even mean at times and yet they still have to be lovable. Melina Marchetta did a great job with this, I really empathized with Taylor and her witty remarks just added another layer to the story. I also loved Rafi and Ben, Taylor's best friends and completely fell in love with Jonah. This book really is full of complex, likeable characters. The reason I took away half a star was because the novel was quite confusing at times. Particularly at the beginning, it took me a while to understand what was going on, who these characters were, what was past and what was present. Getting through these first pages totally paid off though.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes contemporary. I also feel like you would really enjoy it if you liked I'll Give You the Sun.

This extraordinary book changed my life, and maybe it will change yours, too.To tell the truth, JELLICOE ROAD kind of ruins you temporarily for all other books. For several days after I finished this book, I wandered around in a daze. I picked up books, halfheartedly read the first few pages, then put them down and wandered away. Nothing seemed to match the magical dream-come-true that was genius author Melina Marchetta\u2019s third novel.It starts out confusingly. What\u2019s going on? Why is there so much tension between all these people? Who are they, anyway? What do they want? Why are they so serious about their situation? But then, invariably, you\u2019ll get sucked in. It\u2019s probably a little like how the average person might fall in love: you can\u2019t pinpoint exactly when someone became special to you, all you can say is that it happened, and you can\u2019t even remember back to a time when they weren\u2019t special to you.The narration and plot progression of the book reads like a dream: choppy and distracted in a whimsical manner. Don\u2019t expect a conventional story arc, or you\u2019ll probably get really frustrated. Best if you just let it happen as it does. JELLICOE ROAD reads like someone laughing through tears. I couldn\u2019t help but smile as Taylor, Jonah, and the others endeared themselves to me even before I could figure out what was going on between them all, even as their painful discoveries about their tragic pasts tugged at my heartstrings.A story this magnificent, this heartbreaking, shouldn\u2019t have this much hope\u2026but it does.

I was in year 9 of high school and I had just discovered the joy that is reading. I had devoured Melina Marchetta\u2019s Looking for Alibrandi \u2014 which I deeply related to, being Italian-Australian \u2014 and then Saving Francesca. By the time I had picked up On the Jellicoe Road, Marchetta had only published three books, and I was determined to read all of them because I adored her writing.I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say On the Jellicoe Road changed my life. At the young age of 14, I had not yet read a book that affected me on a deep personal level because I had not yet read a wide-range of novels. That changed when I first laid eyes on On the Jellicoe Road. From the very first page, I knew this would be a special book. On the Jellicoe Road draws you in and fits itself snugly into a corner of your heart. This is a story within a story within a story: it\u2019s about a daughter\u2019s desperate search for her mother, it\u2019s about a sister\u2019s love for her brother, it\u2019s about a boy finding solace after years of torment \u2014 it\u2019s about family and friendship, love and heartbreak. It\u2019s about healing, and acknowledging that, even if you don\u2019t believe it right now, you deserve happiness and love, and the world is so lucky to have you. But most of all, it\u2019s about belonging \u2014 to a family, a friendship group, a lover \u2014 whatever; so long as that person accepts you for who you are.I\u2019m probably making it sound like this book is a dark pit of despair and angst, and while sometimes it can be, it\u2019s also funny and romantic, mysterious and poignant. I cried like a baby during darker scenes and was then laughing a mere page later. I squealed approximately every time Jonah Griggs showed up, and blushed like mad whenever he and Taylor interacted. This book is a whirlwind of divergent emotions \u2014 you\u2019ll never know what will hit you and the anticipation is part of its charm.Every character in On the Jecllioe Road is a treasure. I adore them all and you will too, because they\u2019re just so damn relatable. I found pieces of myself in all of them: in Taylor\u2019s stubbornness, in Jonah\u2019s protectiveness, in Raffy\u2019s mother-hen attitudes, in Chaz\u2019s tenacity, and in Jessa\u2019s cheekiness; in Narnie\u2019s steadfastness, in Webb\u2019s joy, in Tate\u2019s love, in Fitz\u2019s liveliness, and in Jude\u2019s vigilance. These incredible, loveable characters are what make the book \u2014 they are so real and in your face, it feels like they\u2019re sitting next to you as you read.Taylor, the main character, is probably one of the first characters I\u2019ve ever fallen in love with. At the beginning of the novel, Taylor is deeply depressed and fed up with the world. She has been betrayed multiple times in her life by the people who are supposed to love her unconditionally, and is thoroughly dejected. But she has such a loving heart, even though she tries her hardest to bury her feelings behind a wall of sarcasm and dry wit (she\u2019s actually hilarious), and attempts to keep people who care for her away because she can\u2019t handle being betrayed again.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken about my first crush before, but it was on a book character: specifically, on Jonah Griggs. If you\u2019ve read this book, you\u2019ll know why I love Jonah Griggs so much and if you haven\u2019t read it, you\u2019ll soon find out. He and Taylor have history together, and it\u2019s not the good kind. She feels as though Jonah betrayed her when they were younger, and as a result, there\u2019s so much tension \u2014 romantic, hostile tension \u2014 between them when they meet again three years later. Jonah is one of the most compelling characters I\u2019ve ever come across; he cares for her so much and I love picking up on his affections throughout the novel, especially the ones Taylor doesn\u2019t notice.If you\u2019re confused for the first 100 pages of the novel, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re supposed to be. This is not a story that is meant to make sense until you\u2019re close to the end. There are several intriguing mysteries peppered throughout the novel, simmering behind the main plot, that don\u2019t make their presence known until close to the end of the book. It\u2019s a brilliantly clever way of telling a story, and I am so impressed by Marchetta\u2019s ability to keep so much of the mystery a secret from the reader for so long. But once you reach a certain point in the novel, you\u2019ll begin to piece together the clues yourself, even though Taylor, our MC, is unaware of them. That\u2019s when you know you\u2019re reading a bloody good book: when the author can reveal something to the reader without the protagonist knowing. I\u2019ve read this book four times and I\u2019m still picking up on clues at the very beginning of the novel that I wasn\u2019t aware of the first time round.I will remember On the Jellicoe Road for the rest of my life. I love this book with all my heart because it taught me so much, but what sticks with me the most is that, just because I might be damaged, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not worthy of love \u2014 any kind of love. You need to read this book to understand. Territory wars, unexpected romance, love, friendship, death, cheesy 80s songs, The Great Escape, and strange dreams all come together to make a flawless novel. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever called a book perfect before, but, oh gosh, On the Jellicoe Road is so damn close.", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["fave-author", "5-star", "ultimate-best", "ya", "contemporary", "romance", "re-read"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/127189138", "review_id": "127189138", "date": "Oct 20, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Brigid \u2729", "user_url": "/user/show/886144-brigid", "text": "Okay ... Ahhh. This is a truly difficult book to review. Usually I am so excited about reviewing books that I have given 5 stars, and I've been dreading writing this review for some reason. Yes, I did like it a lot. But I just was reading through other 5 star reviews and, I'm not sure I liked it quite as much as most people do. I also see that so many reviewers feel so guilty if they disliked it or had any criticisms of it whatsoever, since it is so widely loved ... and I guess that's sort of how I feel. I really liked it, but I'm not sure if I can say I adored it as so many fellow reviewers seem to. Don't get me wrong. This is a very good book. But it didn't make me cry and I'm not fangirling or drooling over it. I enjoyed it in a rather sane manner, I guess you could say. If you've read other reviews of this book (or, you know, if you've read the book itself), you probably know this already\u2013\u2013this book is confusing as heck for at least the first 100 pages. It has two different perspectives\u2013\u2013you know, switching between the present and past kind of deal. Well, not that simple, but, I'm not trying to turn everyone's brains into mush here. And then the main character has these dreams/hallucinations about a boy in a tree and it's like ... Okay, is this really happening? Is this a memory? What? Meanwhile, there are a bunch of private school kids having \"territory wars\", and you don't know what the heck that's about either. So on and so forth. For a while, I promise, you will be very puzzled indeed. I figure readers have one of two reactions\u2013\u2013to throw the book down in frustration, or to be intrigued and keep reading.Well, it was the latter for me. Although personally, I try never to give up on books at all. But even though this book was frustrating at first, it got a lot better as it went on. And even in the beginning, I was interested even though I was bewildered.What carried this book along for me was Melina Marchetta's writing. She has the type of writing style I wish I had ... and since lately I've been in somewhat of a writing slump, reading this kind of made my blood boil, like, \"WHY CAN'T I WRITE THIS WELL?\" But of course, I couldn't hate the writing because it was so good. Damn it. I also found the structure of the book interesting, how the whole thing is a mystery that gradually unfolds as you watch all the different stories connect. Marchetta sure takes the \"show, don't tell\" rule very seriously. And I'm not sure whether it's a good or a bad thing. I suppose it's both. I mean, showing is one thing ... and thrusting the reader into a story they don't understand is another. At first I felt a bit irritated reading this book because I felt like I was being left in the dark. Marchetta doesn't tell us any backstory. On the other hand, I don't think she exactly had a choice, seeing as the book was more about revealing the story piece by piece. But, oh well. It may be slightly aggravating, but I understand the intentions behind it. Moving on ...The characters ... I don't know. I liked them well enough but I didn't feel like I quite connected with them. I was too distracted trying to figure out what was going on. No, they're not bad characters. I thought they were realistic portrayals of teenagers\u2013\u2013how they act, how they talk, how they think, etc. But, I've had stronger connections to characters in other books, which I just did not feel here. So ... just ... ah. I don't know what else to say. This is all very confusing. You may wonder why, then, I'm still giving this book 5 stars. Well, I'm trying to decide whether it's out of guilt. For some reason I would feel bad giving it less, because I understand what Marchetta's intentions were; and I don't think she failed at them, it's just that it took me until the last page to understand them. So I feel like it's more my fault than hers. I also feel like, if I gave this a second read, I would like it a lot more. So I'll have to wait a while and then pick it up again.Sorry, this review is probably utterly nonsensical, and I am just talking to myself now.The point is ... Yes, I recommend this book. Go read it. Think about it for a while, and read it again. And you'll probably like it.

But you won't be left floating in pure confusion, whatever little is revealed in the story will be compelling enough to hold your interest. There's no other way to enjoy this book but to come in blind. Someone asked why Marchetta would tell the story like this. I don't know, maybe because she can?

Real life itself is difficult enough to handle. I use fiction as an escape and I don\u2019t want the fiction I read to be chockful of the issues I\u2019m trying to avoid. At least, not unless there are elves and magic involved. It takes a rare book to make me like realistic fiction and Jellicoe Road is one of the few ones that do.There are three other books on that short list of realistic fiction I absolutely adore and all three of them were also written by Marchetta. Telling, huh?Anyway, I\u2019ve been wanting to write about Jellicoe Road for the longest while. I read it and I loved it so much that I didn\u2019t want to analyze it. So I didn\u2019t. Then I read it again and still didn\u2019t feel like writing anything about it. The third time I read it, I loved it even more\u2013it\u2019s not perfect but it gets so darned close to it that I\u2019m just about incoherent. Hah.The story focuses on two groups of friends. One group of friends is in the present time and the other in the past. The relationship the group in the past has to the group in the present is what the story is made of.The story itself focuses on Taylor Markham. Broken, wounded Taylor who lashes out at everything and everyone that will make her soft. Who clings to the one person who doesn\u2019t give her the answers she\u2019s yearning for. Taylor whom adults continue letting down and Taylor who has dreams of a boy in a tree.The boarding school Taylor attends is divided into different houses that are separated by gender. Taylor is the unwilling leader of one of these houses. But she\u2019s not just the leader of the house; she is also the leader of the underground community. Jellicoe School is involved in a territory war with the townies and the cadets who come camping near Jellicoe Road every summer. Places are lost and regained in this war; there is a purple notebook (courtesy of a Chairman Meow) full of relevant (and sometimes irrelevant) rules. No boarding school gets along with a townie and vice versa\u2013and don\u2019t even think about the cadets.Taylor begins the story as prickly as a porcupine\u2013with good reason. She is estranged from her friends Raffy and Ben in the beginning but eventually thaws out and lets them in. She makes friends with the leader of the townies and the son of the town\u2019s mayor and police chief, Chaz Santangelo. Then there\u2019s Jonah Griggs:Jonah Griggs.Not just a name but a state of mind I never want to revisit\u2026Jonah and Taylor have history. And not the romantic kind. I won\u2019t say anymore because you need to experience it for yourself.The book is heavy and deals with dark and important themes like drug, abandonment, parental neglect and at one point, pedophilia. There is a lot of pain and angst and the questions it asks\u2026Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?are ones that will give you pause. But Marchetta\u2019 magic is in the relationships she builds and the ease with which she portrays them. The friendships between the group in the past and the group in the present are flawed and deeply so but are presented with an inherent honesty that gives evidence of their sincerity. You want to believe that friendships like the ones in the book exist and you want to have friends like the ones in the book. The romances in the novel are subplots and while their importance is considerable, at no point do they take over the story. In fact, they are seamlessly woven through the story. This book is a true crossover novel because all the adults present in the novel are just as easy to empathize with and be sympathetic to as the teenagers which just brings home the point: at no point do we ever stop growing.Also, the book is funny. Witness:I lean against the bars that separate us from the others. \u201cSo let me get this right,\u201d I say to one of the Townie girls. \u201cAll it takes is to insult someone\u2019s mother?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it.

I'd read (and ultimately given up on) something by author Melina Marchetta before - Finnikin of the Rock, which for me personally was not a good reading experience. So I wasn't expecting much with Jellicoe Road; ultimately, I ended up with a new favorite.This book is pure brilliance. The writing is superb; the way Marchetta crafted and executed her story is clever and unique; and the characters are so memorable, lovable, and genuine. Highest compliments from someone who's known to nitpick.*NOW TO CLEAR THE AIR*I do want to make a few points about Jellicoe Road that may make the reading experience more enjoyable: * Jellicoe Road is **not** a dystopian book. The 'war' is a traditional turf-competition between rival teenagers: those who live in the boarding school, 'Townies,' and Sydney Cadets who participate in a 6-week training program out in the bush. * There are two stories told simultaneously throughout the book. Taylor's story, set in the present day, in told in regular font, and the story that Taylor reads about is set almost 2 decades prior and is told in italicized font.* Pay attention to the characters, because this has a fairly large ensemble cast. I made little biographies of them on my bookmark. Seriously.* The book is set in Australia, so a wee bit of knowledge about the Australian education system would be beneficial (at the beginning, I just had a tab from the Wikipedia article up). What I look for in a powerful, \"favorite book\" type is a meaningful connection (I call it the 'Why Should I Care?' factor). Light-hearted entertainment is great, but the best stories (in my opinion) are the ones that are moving and substantial, stories that are simply unforgettable. If you read Jellicoe Road, I am willing to bet it will be a story you never forget. To be honest, I try to stay away from \"hot mess\" books; in other words, the types of stories in which characters simply have a screw loose. These are the stories (and yes, they seem to be on the rise in YA) in which characters do stupid things for apparently no reason and remain oblivious to the consequences of their actions. Yeah, we all have \"hot mess\" moments in our lives, so we can all relate, surely, but I want to see growth and character depth. I also don't like \"bummer books\" - meaning books that are just so heavy on sensitive subjects or \"issues\" that they descend into melodrama. With Jellicoe Road, what's interesting is that despite the heavy subject matter (and the book does deal with some pretty mature topics), Jellicoe never descends into melodrama. Marchetta's book is captivating, but it's not exhausting and it's not emotionally manipulative, either. There's just enough humor and hope mixed in to counterbalance the drama and tragedy. All of the characters have some hurt, habit, or hangup that they deal with over the course of the story, and this is definitely no exception for the two main characters, narrator Taylor Markham and (my favorite) Jonah Griggs. Taylor's young life is a complicated and sometimes depressing story, but Marchetta never casts her as a victim; over the course of the novel, Taylor manages to come to terms with her circumstances and tries to cope with them. In a genre that often portrays teenage girls as walking stereotypes, I greatly appreciated the way Marchetta created Taylor: strong, but also vulnerable; sweet on the inside, yet unsure how to express affection; scared of the future and life's uncertainties, but brave enough to take responsibility and leadership for her world. Perfect. And without saying too much, I think that Jonah Griggs is the **perfect** love interest that I just knew existed somewhere, but hadn't quite found yet. I don't mean he's 'perfect' like he's without flaws or has no personality, I mean his character compliments Taylor in just the right way. This was indeed a very strong pairing. I am a LEGIT fan.I know that this review is already really long, and if you've read everything so far, have a cookie on me!Two more things I want to address quickly:- Portrayal of Friendship: I'd argue that the theme of friendship is a major one in Jellicoe Road, and the relationships Taylor forges with her peers is both real and inspiring. It was so moving to watch a troubled, unsure young girl transform into a caring, empathetic leader. Beautiful! And Taylor's friends are so lovable and memorable, they definitely helped make the book what it is. I also loved and appreciated that these were healthy, substantial relationships, which brings me to my final point:- Portrayal of teenagers. I love YA and won't ever read any other genre as faithfully, but to be honest, quite a few books out there make me embarrassed for teenagers today, just based on the stereotypical ways they're portrayed. For a bunch of kids living in a pretty isolated community, with not a lot of useful teachers or adults around, these kids were pretty dadgum responsible. Like, incredibly so. And I'm not talking about one or two - I mean the whole ensemble cast. This may be a point of irrelevance to a lot of readers, but I wanted to point out how grateful and amused I was to read about such entertaining but mature teens. Maybe one of the (many) reasons why I loved this book is because I respected these characters, what they had to go through and how they handled themselves in the process. And my guess is that you will too.Quick say: I've found a new classic and a new favorite. Please (older teens) give Jellicoe Road a try.

Too much has happened to Taylor, specifically her abandonment by her mother and the desertion of Cadet Jonah Griggs when she tried to find her mother, to allow her to trust easily. When her friend and mentor Hannah disappears as well, Taylor retreats from her new responsibilities as leader of her school. It\u2019s all perfectly justified in the text, but her complete irresponsibility drove me crazy.Taylor accepts the role not because she wants to be in charge, but because she hates the idea of being under anyone else\u2019s control\u2014and proceeds to screw up repeatedly because every time things get tough, she retreats to Hannah\u2019s empty house. I hate it when people agree to do something and then ignore their responsibilities. It really gets on my nerves. So it was probably most of a hundred pages before I started caring about Taylor.And then I deeply cared about her. Once she starts letting people in, she\u2019s engaging, tough, and loyal. She does have the ability to lead, and demonstrates it repeatedly, from brokering a peace between the three factions of school, Townies, and Cadets to finally tracking down her mother. I was impressed by Taylor\u2019s strength and determination as well as her weaknesses\u2014ultimately, by her humanity.Jellicoe Road has powerful secondary characters, all of whom are tied to Taylor in some way; in a sense, Taylor\u2019s character is revealed by her allowing others to rely on her and be relied on in turn. And it\u2019s not just her House members like Jessa and Raffaela, or anyone else in school, such as Ben or even the detestable Richard; Santangelo and Griggs, who originally seem like typical bullies, turn out to be some of the best friends she could ask for.Griggs fascinated me, and not just because he\u2019s the love interest. He\u2019s got as tragic a history as Taylor and is broken in his own way, and I love that their story begins long before the book does. He\u2019s violent and mean, but it\u2019s clear early on that this is something he puts on for show, a way of protecting himself. He\u2019s conscious, as I think most children in his position are, of how much of him is like his abusive father, and the contrast between his more brutal behaviors and his tenderness toward Taylor makes him compelling.In addition to the wonderful characters, the structure of Jellicoe Road, with its intertwining stories, really won me over. I like having a challenge when I read, and Hannah\u2019s \u201cnovel,\u201d told out of sequence, was wonderfully challenging. Despite having trouble remembering which of the five characters was which to start, I found myself looking forward to the narrative intervals to see if I could puzzle out what happened. As a conceit, it\u2019s a little too perfect\u2014coincidentally the order in which Taylor reads the story reveals the truth in exactly the right order to keep her (and the reader) guessing, but the story itself is so compelling I was willing to give it a pass.What also worked for me is how that narrative ended up bringing the three factions together and undoing some of the misunderstandings that had arisen with time. At the beginning, it doesn\u2019t look as if Taylor and her people can ever be friends with the Townies, headed by Chaz Santangelo, and the Cadets, led by Jonah Griggs (with whom Taylor has a history). And somehow they manage to stumble toward an accord that\u2019s managed by the fact that both Griggs and Santangelo are essentially nice guys who have to work really hard at being jerks.This is ultimately a story about restoration: restoring Taylor\u2019s faith in others, restoring her relationship with her mother, restoring the original understanding between the three factions. It also has a lot to say about how most people are essentially good. One of my favorite scenes is a very tense meeting between the three faction leaders and their seconds, where they can\u2019t maintain the tension because the seconds are all musicians and drift away into an argument about amplifiers.As for Taylor and Griggs and their romance, it\u2019s clear early on that he cares for her, but their relationship isn\u2019t so much romantic (though it\u2019s that too) as based on mutual need. The third story in this book, after the primary plot and Hannah\u2019s story, is the truth about what happened when the two of them ran away\u2014an episode that linked them both so it was inevitable they would ultimately come together. And yet that mutual need is as compelling a romance as I could want. The moment that brought them together, for me, wasn\u2019t their first kiss, but the point where Griggs tells Taylor why he was on the train platform that day. Romance comes later\u2014though Taylor has to point out to Griggs that he\u2019s been romantic\u2014and it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. I can easily see the two of them lasting as a couple because of the depth of their connection.I read this twice for the Book Battle, the second time taking notes for my bracket, but by the time I reached Taylor and Griggs\u2019 road trip I had to put the pen down because I was simply sucked into the story. It\u2019s beautiful, and heart-wrenching, and I love how ultimately both narratives are about a need to belong to something bigger than oneself. I fully intend to come back to this book again and again.", "num_likes": 14, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["own", "favorites", "book-battle-2016", "protag-female", "romance", "supernatural", "ya-contemporary-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1595249066", "review_id": "1595249066", "date": "Mar 30, 2016", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Jacob Proffitt", "user_url": "/user/show/1331641-jacob-proffitt", "text": "I can't get past the word \"devastating\" to describe the effect this book had on me but that word has all the wrong connotations. But any other word doesn't have quite the right strength. So when I say that it was devastating, read that as \"in all the right ways\". Which means I suspect it'll be one of my very favorite books ever, even though I doubt I'll be able to bring myself to reread it and I'll be careful about who I recommend it to.It's a challenging start, too, which doesn't help in the recommendation area. You have a huge cast of characters, a problematic viewpoint character, political factions (with subfactions and associated power dynamics), and a 22-year time span that all hit you right up front. Don't get me wrong, I was drawn in right from the start and Marchetta is good enough that I didn't feel lost so much as overwhelmed. Reading other reviews, it's clear that the reactions to this jumbled start are mixed and highly varied. Personally, Taylor drew me in immediately with her mix of vulnerability and courage so I was strongly engaged and willing to spend the mental energy to track all the moving pieces. And it does take mental energy because a lot of the story happens in the past and is revealed in patches and fragments along the way.The fact this all comes together (and gets such consistently high reviews for such a challenging work) is tribute to Marchetta's storytelling skill. All those pieces coalesce organically and very powerfully over the course of the novel to form a complete story that carries an immense emotional power. It'd be interesting to track a group of people who read the book in tandem and see how their experiences and opinions match up over the course of the novel. I suspect that while they'd be all over the map at the start, they'd quickly converge such that whatever drew them in initially (and kept them going past the challenging beginning) they'd be in shared-experience space relatively quickly. I think that's part of the power of the structure Marchetta has created because she weaves all those disparate elements of the story into a powerful whole that is full of those things that define us in our shared humanity\u2014love, power, tragedy, despair, redemption, forgiveness, friendship, frailty, and family.There are a lot of elements coming together here, and I'm not organized enough to be terribly detailed. So here are some thoughts on some of them, for what they're worth.Griggs and Taylor I Loved the second-chance romance between Taylor and Griggs. I loved seeing the development of that relationship in the present and the reverberations from their meeting three years ago. I particularly liked seeing them draw strength from each other where they needed it most. But my favorite part of their relationship is that I can easily see it persisting a lifetime, even as young as they are. Theirs is a bond based on mutual respect and care and with their eyes open to the potential for change that the future brings (and working together to let that change unite rather than divide them).Time Fragments The ripples of three past tragedies (the third a near-miss with its own ramifications) are interwoven in the narrative in a way that is easy to get wrong. Marchetta does a fantastic job making these work in unison, even on their separate tracks. And even though it looks like you discover the key to each separately, they actually function together to deliver a catharsis at the end in a way that each not only builds on, but multiplies the effect of the others. This story could probably have been told chronologically. But that would have robbed it of so much of its power.Tate Sucks The truth we learn about Taylor's mother draws my sympathy for her personally, but horrifies me in regards to her daughter. (view spoiler)[It's bad enough that she dragged her daughter through her despair and drug addiction. But what kind of mother artificially constrains the love of the generous woman who will care for Taylor for the foreseeable future by extracting a promise not to become a surrogate mom?!? Talk about selfish in the extreme! That ended all sympathy for Tate and pissed me off at Hannah for giving such a promise. And then fulfilling it! Shame on both of them. And what I really hated is that everybody treated that as perfectly reasonable\u2014including Taylor. (hide spoiler)]Magic or Spirituality or Something The supernatural has a very present, though subdued, place in this story. It's nothing too overt, mainly impressions and dreams. But I loved how not only the characters, but the story took these aspects of humanity seriously. I loved that they have real power (if only in the lives of those who experience them and take them seriously). I particularly liked the solid spirituality it gave the story without having to explain everything (even itself).Finally So yeah, I loved the book. I knew by a quarter through that I wouldn't be putting it down until I finished. I have no regrets for the lost sleep. The emotional punch at the end was everything you hope for in the very best stories.", "num_likes": 14, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/114650027", "review_id": "114650027", "date": "Aug 01, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Tina", "user_url": "/user/show/1552211-tina", "text": "Original post at One More PageI'm a little bit OC when it comes to my reviewing order, and it's not often that I skip over some books I need to review first to write one for another. Usually doing that means one of the following: I am in a hurry to post a review for the book for a deadline (doesn't usually happen), or I love the book so much that I just have to write a review about it immediately.Such is Jellicoe Road, my second Melina Marchetta book. Ever since I finished and enjoyed Saving Francesca, I've been itching to read another Marchetta book to experience the goodness of her writing and the realness of her characters. But alas, I know I must pace myself because Jellicoe was the only other book I had of hers -- I still had to buy The Piper's Son and Looking for Alibrandi after Holy Week. After finishing two books from my Required Reading for April, I decided to reward myself with her book.And man, was it such a good idea. I gobbled up Jellicoe Road so fast that I surprised myself. Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham, whose mom left her when she was 11, picked up shortly by Hannah. At fourteen, she ran away from her boarding school to look for her mom only to be found and brought back by a stranger. Now, she's almost eighteen, and she is the leader of their school's underground community that is neck deep in a territory war with the kids from Jellicoe town called Townies and a group of kids undergoing military training aptly named Cadets. Then Hannah disappears and it throws Taylor's life out of the loop. If it wasn't enough, the leader of the Cadets turn out to be Jonah Griggs, a guy from Taylor's past that she's trying hard to forget. Taylor's life unravels as she tries to cope with Hannah's disappearance, piecing together clues Hannah left and things her memory is trying to hide from her.One word: wow. I was warned that this book would be an emotional ride, but I wasn't expecting that. It's really hard to describe the book without putting a spoiler, and the last thing you want to be with this book is to be spoiled. I've been warned that the first 100 pages or so of this book would be confusing, and indeed it was. For some people, this might be enough for them to stop reading and never revisit the book again, but trust me when I say this: don't. Keep on reading, and somewhere a few pages later, you'll find that this book had you in its grip and will refuse to let you go up until the last page.Just like in Saving Francesca, Marchetta definitely had her way with the characters and how they interact here. I thought the book would just be about the territory wars, which kind of turns me off, but the author made that as interesting as figuring out Taylor's past. I loved the relationships that the characters formed in this book -- they all had history with each other, and even if I have equally awesome friends, this book made me crave the same history that Taylor wanted: \"These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\" I loved how they all just formed this friendship without too much effort, and how some characters who come off as annoying at first become even a little bit endearing in the end.But that plot -- oh that plot. When I got to my first \"aha!\" moment in the book, I just couldn't stop reading. I wanted to know what happens next and I want it now. At the same time, I also didn't want it to end. I just want to live in Jellicoe Road, if that was possible. I loved how everything tied up together at the end, and how the story kept on surprising me everyday. Even when I thought I had it all figured out, I was still surprised at the end, and I don't think I've ever read a book that did just that. When I was done with the book, I had an extreme desire to reread it all over again, if only to figure out what part I missed now that I knew how everything fits.While I was going through the first part of the book, I wasn't really sure if I would like it as much as my other bookish friends did. When I closed the last page, I was sure that I had just as much love for this book as they do. Like what I tweeted, reading this book was like breaking my heart and then putting it back together again. It was that awesome. Jellicoe Road reminded me of why I love contemporary YA, and it definitely made me a fan of Melina Marchetta. :)Read it, read it. Take your time with the start and be amazed at how Marchetta weaves a story so beautiful that it keeps a hold on you long after you have closed the book. \u2665", "num_likes": 14, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2011", "best-2011", "contemporary", "ya", "tfg-100", "favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1617459324", "review_id": "1617459324", "date": "Apr 22, 2016", "rating": 5, "user_name": "destini", "user_url": "/user/show/13742215-destini", "text": "\nA home to come back to every day of their lives.Where they would all belong or long to be.

Where to start with a book like this? The first half is odd and so confusing. You understand the gist that there's a territory war going on between the residents of Jellicoe Road and they're split into three factions; the Townies, the Cadets, and the students of the Jellicoe School. Of course, enter our main cast, which is a mix of all three and you can see how this would be fun and entertaining. But this book doesn't stop there; there's also flashbacks to a group a generation before who suffered death through a huge car accident on Jellicoe Road. These flashbacks are vague in the beginning, but slowly gain clarity until the image is too heartbreaking and clear.Both groups are riddled with traumas and sadness. The main character, Taylor, was left at a 7-11 at eleven years old. The generation before suffered the death of most of their families in a huge car accident. Every character in this novel has a purpose, problems, and a personality all their own. It's so hard to not give legions of spoilers right now, but I'll resist the temptation so that those who haven't read this can be encouraged to do so.Marchetta's writing is unique to say the least. It's interesting, but oh so exiguous. By the end of the book, you still have no idea of eye colors, hair colors, and for some characters, you know absolutely nothing of how they look, just their typical facial expressions and maybe some body language.This was both great and frustrating. I appreciate her different way of approaching description since I created the images of the characters in my own mind, and even if they look the opposite of how I'm picturing them, I would still know them just by their walk or the way they crinkle their nose. I don't know; maybe my mild OCD is why the whole no general description drove me bonkers. That's my only complaint, and that's not even a real problem since I don't actually mind as much now that I've finished it. :)The final thing I wanted to praise was a parallel Marchetta hid in here. I loved that she did it, and adored how she presented it. (view spoiler)[(When Taylor saw Sam and thought about how she could have turned out the same way had her mother not \"given\" her to Hannah. I was so depressed I ate a whole bag of Haribo.) (hide spoiler)]All I can say is read this book. Especially if you enjoy books taking place in private schools, small towns, or Australia.

It's not even clear what her plight is, exactly. We learn she was, at age 11, abandoned by her drug-addled mother at a 7-11 store on the Jellicoe Road, we know she attends a boarding school with \"warring factions\" between classes and residence houses (never explained well, and never really factors in the story, anyway), we know she has a boy that likes her named Jonah Griggs, and she may or may not like him back. There's a few Kenny Rogers jokes (yeah, the '70's-80's country crooner...how au courant). There's more flashbacks than you can shake a stick at, and  none of them makes an iota of sense. (Yeah, they eventually do, but by the time they do, you probably will have given up caring ). Heck, I'm getting confused and bored just writing this. I'll stop here, but I'll just say I just didn't get the appeal of this book. Kudos to those who could plumb its depths and derive meaningful enjoyment from it.

There are 2 story lines in this book that alternate, past and present. They come together to reveal the mystery behind Taylor's identity and family history.

I've read and enjoyed books written like this before, but this one took a bit too long to get some answers and by then I had forgotten a few details. Everything does come together at the end though.The plot itself is very emotional and dense with a touch of mystery added. Though I didn't really care for the \"war games\" going on at the school. It was poorly explained and I found it was pointless as it was in the story but nothing was really done with it. Like an after-thought. The characters were well constructed.

The hesitance came from the fact that I had no idea how to form the words that could possibly explain the actual beauty and brilliance of this book. When I think of it a lump forms in my throat and I imagine this distant place called Jellicoe Road, a place I wish I could be a part of, and meet the wonderful people that reside there; the kind of people you come across once in a lifetime.I've decided to do this. I'm attempting this even though everything is blurry as I write this which makes it all the more harder. It's exactly 4am and somehow I feel like I've just woken up. You know after I turned that last page and closed the book I felt peaceful, so why I am getting emotional whilst writing this review is strange to me too. So lets go over the not so great news first. It will take you around 90 somethings - 100 pages to get into the book. Everything before all that is confusing and slow. But if you can bring yourself to trudge through those first 100 pages guys, then you will delve into heck of a treasure. The only way to describe my personal reading experience is to let you know that I stopped functioning almost. The need for food was gone, the need for breaks was gone. I didn't get up once even though I was pretty sure I had ran out of tissues and panicked over the thought of having no more to use for bookmarking. Leaving the book did just not seem like an option though. I worked with what I had and only let myself take a deep breath when I felt chocked up, laughed, or sighed. And yes, I did all those. Let's just say I was lucky that I had tissues nearby because I would need them to bookmark countless pages throughout. Also I was lucky that I had my Laptop nearby because the perfect song, besides the book, would be the one thing to keep me company. * 1+1 by Beyonce, it's perfect for the book. Listen to it whilst you're reading it and you''ll see why* I'm not sure when I started reading. It's been a couple of hours though. So bring some snacks, tissues and anything else you might need because as soon as I cracked this book open I didn't move an inch. I kept reading, replaying the song, bookmarking; this became my whole routine. I breathed this book and completely fell in love. Just to let you know; I have been wowed the odd times like this in the past - through The Sky Is Everywhere and Thirteen Reasons Why but it's been a very long time since I've found that wonderful connection with a book again. Reading Jellicoe Road makes me slap away the reading slump I have been battling recently, and makes me look at treasures like these and ask myself; can I ever imagine ever missing out on this? Audrey over at Holes In My Brain told me how fantastic this book was. We have very similar taste in books, and I completely trust her, so there was no question about it. I bought myself a copy. However, it took her recent, wonderful review to inspire me to stop thinking about review books for a second. To take a good look at my bookshelf and pick out a book that I have wanted to read for a long time. Jellicoe Road came to mind, and I am so glad that I went on a whim. Thanks for that hun.For the first time I feel like I can't find it within me to elaborate on the plot or characters. But maybe it's better this way. Leaving as much a mystery as possible will only reward you with a greater reading experience as you peel away the layers of this book. Let me make another thing clear. The first 100 pages are worth it not only because the book is such gem, but because it's only after those 100 pages that things start to make sense and the links between the present and the past start to unfold. Also, you should know that every character held their own. At one point it felt as though history was repeating itself, only without all the loss, without all the tragedy. This time around it was almost like a second chance; they were better equipped and more prepared. This time they found that place that would ensure their togetherness, that would always be there. All the characters are so lovely, mature and lovable. They all bring something unique to the table. And then you have the whole concept of the Townies, Cadets and the school leader being our MC Taylor. I could take you through the beauty of those 5 individuals who 18 years ago were young, alive, strong and in love. I could take you through how this whole concept of the Cadets and Townies first came, and how when I see Jonah, Chaz, Taylor, Jessa and Raffy - I see Tate, Narnie, Jude, Fritz and Webb.I miss each and every one of them so much. I miss the thought of knowing that I will probably never read a book like this again. Knowing that it ended the only way that it could have, but in doing so wiped away any chance of a sequel. Oh, how I would love that sequel. I knew though when the end came that this was the part where I took a different road and walked away from it all. That is always the hard part when you become attached; that is the hardest of all.Jellicoe Road has taken me through a unique journey, and one I'm highly unlikely to forget. Maybe this review will give you that push to pick up your neglected copy of Jellicoe Road, or maybe it'll be just the thing you need to put the book on your radar, either way, that is more than enough for me. However, after I've posted this I know my greatest frustration will lie in knowing that I could never fully express how I felt about this book, how I can't give you that experience. That is the part that truly gets to me above else. My review can't even come close to doing this book justice, I know that. And maybe when I wake up in the morning I'll read this and be horrified by all these jumbled up thoughts, and slightly embarrassed at this emotional me, but right now, it feels so right. Oh and Jonah; my favourite. I'd watch out for that one girls.

On the one hand, if they are done right, the story hooks you, and makes you need to know how the disparate scenes are connected, and how they got to be what you're seeing. Those kinds of stories are fantastic. On the other hand, there are stories like [On the] Jellicoe Road, which just plop you down in the middle of everything - present, past, dreams, etc - with everything melding together and creating this surreal stew, which leaves the reader utterly confused until such a time as the author decides to, I dunno, introduce a character mid-way through the book. This is the type of book that requires a patient reader... and a patient reader I am not. I tried starting this book on my Nook several times, and I just could not get into it. The opening line is fantastic, and the prologue always hooked me with a promise of this book being the kind that would speak to me in emotional terms... but then the book proper would lose me... every single time. It's just too jumbled, and the abrupt shifts of main character (which I didn't even realize until attempt #4 at starting this), perspectives and scenes just threw me off and I'd move to something less confusing... promising myself that another time I'd try again with Jellicoe. Then this book ended up being my real life bookclub book, and I determined to push through and actually finish it, because I'm determined to finish all of the bookclub books. But still I found it hard to actually READ this book. Maybe it was the formatting of my Nook copy, which is very... free-verseish? Not sure if this is how the actual book is or if there's a problem with my copy, but it was extremely distracting. So I said screw it and downloaded the audio from Audible. So now I've finished, and well... I don't know. For much of the book I was quite a bit less than impressed, but after the 60% mark the story actually DID start coming together and I was (finally) intrigued to see where it went. But having to trudge through 2/3 of a book in confusion is a LOT to ask of readers, especially (I think) teen and YA readers, which is the target audience. And, personally, I just don't think it was worth it. I think it could have been more coherent and written in a way that doesn't require the reader to have the patience of Job just to get to the part where the STORY starts. And this was especially true of the audio, because with that damn music leading and ending each chapter, it felt like each chapter was a series of individual snapshots rather than a story. Once the past and present storylines finally joined up I was almost fed up waiting for it.That being said, I did enjoy the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and Fitz. I enjoyed the message, that family is found in the most surprising situations and that we never know what the future will hold, so it's best to live and love in the moment. I also felt like this was a story of absolutes, the kind of absolutes that make moving on near to impossible because of the amount of oneself given into another person's care, and how dangerous that can be for the one who gives of themselves that way... you might never be able to be whole again. Not that that lesson was learned by the younger generation though, because even learning of Tate's struggles after loving someone so completely that she's literally incapable of functioning without him, Taylor jumps right onto that bandwagon and goes for the same kind of ride. Fuckin' insta-love.And that's all I'll say about that. I did actually like Jonah though. He was pretty funny, and as a love interest in a YA story, I can say with complete honesty that he's probably one of the most likeable and relatable I've read about in a long, long time. Just a smidge too-good-to-be-true, but at least he wasn't emotionally abusive or controlling or fucking psychotic like is apparently the IN THING in YA these days. So, overall, I was underwhelmed by this story. I wanted it to be great, and I wanted it to really wow me. But it just didn't. There were some great moments, some poignant scenes, and even a little tear may have been jerked toward the end... but then I kept waiting for it to end... and perfect endings were coming and going, and I'm sitting there thinking \"What is she waiting for? END THE STORY.\" I think the book should have ended at the end of Chapter 25. Maybe the epilogue would still be OK, because it doesn't need chapters 26 or 27 to exist. But it just kept going, and that again was an irritation, because it felt a little manipulative. Gotta squeeze out that last little bit of emotion by stretching the Tate & Taylor bit, wrapping up the Hannah & Jude, and the Taylor and Jonah romances, and tying everything with a lovely pink ribbon.

They may overlook these young adult books, and we know that young adult books will never get a Nobel prize or something, but sometimes they forget that teenagers also deserve books that they can relate to. That's when young adult book becomes important because it--in particular way--helps shape the personality of young souls. A good young adult book can provoke the mind of its young readers--a better one can wreck and havoc their feeling. Marchetta's Jellicoe Road is one of the better ones. Marchetta's flair in capturing the teenage angst becomes her strongest point in this book. Let's be real here. Teenage angst is something real, and adult people sometimes forget that being a teenager can be hard because teenagers still search who they really are, they still search their real self, and it's a hard phase. They're a vagabond, looking for the meaning of life, and if they run into wrong side, they can ruin their life forever. So, see, it's hard being a teenager. And that's what makes Jellicoe Road feel so emotional and raw because Marchetta is being honest to their readers. She gives us an imperfect protagonist and says, \"Here's Taylor Markham. She's having trouble, like most of you, so let's see how she solves her problems together.\" Taylor is a sincere character. Her angst, her search for her mother, her frustration, and her insecurity are not artificial. They all are perfectly captured by Marchetta, captivated in an amazing and extremely beautiful way of writing, that feels so soulful and emotional. It's really hard to write in such ways, that you can feel every part of Taylor's soul insinuated on Marchetta's sentences; that sometimes Taylor and her friends were alive, and the story Hannah writes were alive as well. She handles her problem in the most teenage way as possible, and sometimes she makes mistakes. But Marchetta tells her readers it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to cry, it's okay to get angry, because that's how you learn. It's just heartbreaking to follow Taylor's journey in finding the true meaning of family and friendship. Jellicoe Road is such an important book for young readers because they can learn a lot about family and friendship from a book that they can relate. It indeed deserves that Michael L. Printz award, one of the highest awards that a young adult book can get. When Narnie asks her father, \"What's the difference between a trip and a journey\", and her father answers, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand\", I think he's wrong. For me, a trip is only about fun, but journey is something you can contemplate with, you may have fun, but you may also cry in forlorn, you may get angry, you may get depressed, but that's the beauty of journey; it will all pay off when you reach your destination. A journey is when you begin to read Jellicoe Road.

I was just sucked into a completely different world of cadets, townies and kids at the boarding school competing for territories, it felt so real and I loved it so much, that I just didn\u2019t want this book to end. Taylor is one of the best female characters I have come across in a while; she had this fearlessness about her that I really liked. I absolutely adored Raffy and Santangelo, every time they were together they just brought a huge smile to my face. I loved Jonah, he wasn\u2019t your typical male character; we got to see his macho side and also his vulnerable side, which he tried to keep guarded (this just made me love him even more!).

I have read a couple of her previous books and loved them as well but this one is my all time favorite of all time.

I know fully believe that this woman can write anything and I will love it. Her way with words is like a song they just sing to the reader. The story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude, and Fitz was the hardest story I have ever read and I loved every minute of it. I loved trying to figure out all the confusion that Marchetta weaved into her story and I am proud to say that I figured out everything except for one detail that I should have seen but overlooked as my love for a character shadowed my eyes. Taylor was a great character. I loved her relationship with Jonah. She took no poo from him and he took no poo from her it was a very realistic from the start. There was one part in the book that my heart literally jumped right out of my chest and when you read this you will know the exact page where it happened because that scene is very overwhelming and so real that it hurts.

But for me it wasn\u2019t only confusing, it was also messy, pointless and absolutely ridiculous once you know what the story is really about.The author uses the first half of the book focusing on just one element of the story and because it\u2019s so intense, you are lead to think that it\u2019s the central storyline of the book and yet it actually turns out to mean basically nothing when it comes to the bigger picture; an inside joke between some of the characters , Yes, It has some sentimental value but that\u2019s it.\n\nIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how to feel about that, Because the author wasted half of her material on basically nothing when she have so many things to depict and portray like the loss of a loved one, grief, survival guilt and abandonment issues. Yes, the story once it gets going is deeply sad and moving but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s written or executed well; The story after all deals with sensitive issues that I\u2019m not immune to. If someone in the street tries telling a sad story and you feel for it and it affects you, it doesn\u2019t mean he/she is a great storyteller, it just means you\u2019re having a proper human reaction to something that will upset anyone.Also the transition from the first half to the second is so jarring, It doesn\u2019t give you time to well adjust and to connect to the characters and what\u2019s happening to them.\n\nHold my hand because I might disappear\n\nSpeaking of the characters; expect the main one who\u2019s well written and fleshed out; the others are simply there, they\u2019re not complex, they don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s for them and they felt flat to me.\n\nMaybe memories should be left the way they are\n\nThe book alternates between 2 timelines that are connected somehow. I was invested way more to the past timeline, I thought it was engaging, deeply touching but rushed and neglected. I think if the book was split equally between the two timelines, I would\u2019ve been completely in love with it. Everything about the past storyline was convincing and believable and it made me feel deeply for the characters while the present timeline felt unconvincing, confusing and not well executed. \n\nGrief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for. \n\nI\u2019m really upset because I wanted to love this book and I expected it to be a new favorite of mine and it could\u2019ve been but here we are , Maybe I\u2019m missing some hidden meaning in that first half that would make all of it worth it, maybe I\u2019m not getting it the way I should.

Taylor Markham was a teenage girl living in a boarding school. Her mother deserted her when she was very young and a woman named Hannah living in the vicinity of that school had found her all those years ago. Hannah sort of looked after her for a while until Taylor was a permanent resident of Jellicoe school. There she and her friends got in a kind of territory war with other kids from other schools but her mind was mostly occupied with finding ways to search for her mother and discover her past. The book began with a story written by Hannah about a fictional accident where two families died twenty years ago. After the accident, the kids of those families grew up together in that same boarding school. They had the kind of friendship that could only be formed by people who had no one but each other in the world. One day Hannah just disappeared without any explanation and Taylor was devastated because Hannah was the only person she thought was hers. Taylor was often drawn towards that incomplete story by Hannah and around in the middle of the book she began to have a feeling that her past had a link to that story. How exactly were those fictional characters connected to her? Why did her mother leave her when she was young? How did Hannah know exactly where to find her and why did she even care for Taylor so much? This is the type of book where for a long time nothing makes sense and then as you go on all the seemingly unimportant loose threads wrap up neatly.Jellicoe Road is a nearly perfect YA book in my opinion. This book deals with grief. The grief of losing the person that meant the world to you or even losing the person you never knew but loved anyway. This is a perfect tragedy. While reading it I couldn't help but think of Zafar Iqbal and Sheba prokshoni books that I loved as a child. Particularly one by Sheba called \"Class Eight\". Those fights over which group gets to use which part of the town, boarding school shenanigans, unlikely friendships with someone you thought would be an enemy, teen angst, little character moments that will make you feel so sad- all these elements are so beloved to me because I grew up with them. The only complaint is that some of the characters especially the juniors acted too juvenile. I kept seeing the thirteen-year-olds as 7-year-olds in my mind because of how they talked. And Taylor acted too impatient and dumb most of the time. It took awfully long for everything to be resolved that readers would see from miles. Taylor's history I could predict almost immediately after I started to get into the story because twists like this had been done many times. I wonder why it took her so long to connect everything about her past. But in my opinion, nobody should read it for the twists but the life and turmoils of an abandoned and a toughened teenage girl. For the hearts in past broken beyond mending. And for those families that had everything until they didn't. I did a bad job explaining what I felt reading this story...suffice to say it stomped on my heart with the force of an angry buffalo. I'm sobbing my heart out at 3 in the morning and I can't breathe. And crying while reading books is rare for me. \n\"My mother took seventeen years to die. I counted.She died in a house on the Jellicoe Road.

What to say about this book...I've put off writing this review, because I don't really know how to describe it in a coherant fashion. For the first 150 pages or so, I was absolutely lost. I contemplated giving up several times and could not keep up with how disjointed this story was. Melina Marchetta wasted absolutely no time diving right into the guts of the plotline, offering exceedingly little explanation. At times, I felt like I was nodding along with a conversation about quantum physics or (cringe) politics, while posses no prior knowledge of the subject. Thank God my GR friends encouraged me to keep on reading. Marchetta is a beautiful, poetic writer. There are so many quotes within this novel that I want to write down in a notebook and keep with me at all times, or have tattooed somewhere discreet. They're that profound. She nailed the complexity aspect of this novel. I did need some further discussion and explanation following my completion of the book, so I could make sure that I actually understood what happened, but once I was clued into each detail, I was blown away. There are so many different interwoven layers within Jellicoe Road. I highly suggest, at the advice of Alexa, to keep a sheet of paper with you and write the characters names down in order to keep them straight. This might sound silly, but it would've helped me so much more if I'd have done this! Taylor Markham is a fantastic female lead. She is independent and loyal. She has a bit of a temper, but that just makes her colorful. I thought at the beginning that she was kind of frigid towards some of the girls within her House, but she can't help it. Taylor had so much love and affection within herself, but came off emotionally constipated, likely due to her tragic past and difficulty with those close to her. I loved, loved, LOVED the progression of the relationship between Jonah and Taylor. Jonah is so incredibly romantic <3 I will definitely go back and re-read some of his lines whenever I need a good swoon. I loved them because there was an underlying affection, even though both of them were supposed to be die-hard enemies. The two fit so perfectly together, like some heart-shaped puzzle piece (so corny, I know. It's late.) I want more of these two, yet I'm 100% satisfied with their situation and how the story ended. The story of Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Webb, and Jude is a heartbreaking one. Again, I can't say much about these five without giving away a rather significant portion of the story, but this bunch claimed my heart and ran with it. Jellicoe Road and all of its characters were filled with this all-encompassing love for one another, that I could feel my heart swelling even though I had tears streaking down my face. I don't think I've ever read so many characters that possessed such selfless, genuine love for one another. And the best part? It wasn't cheesy at all. It felt real. You know what else felt real? The angst. The heartbreak. The losses. And there's quite a bit of each category in this one. Be prepared. Surround yourself with a few boxes of Kleenex. I will definitely be reading more of Marchetta's work in the future, but am slightly intimidated that all her stories will be as complex as this one. Truly, though, her writing is so wonderful that the brain-busting will be worth it.

For me, it was a story that showed how family and friends can love, support, and protect us in life and long after. But we also have to listen.

It is a book that you need to go into knowing little about. For the first 100 or so pages, I was completely baffled. The chapters are confusing and the main plotline seems to hover on the periphery never really coming close enough for you to figure out. The writing is intense and emotional and remained so, even when I couldn't quite grasp what it was i was feeling.I don't even really know what to say, other than I knew Melina was building this story from where it needed to begin, and that she wrote the story this way for a reason. Trust me, she did. In the end, when all the little threads of plot so carefully crafted at the beginning of the book start coming together, you are left with a story so compelling, so heartbreakingly beautiful. One unlike anything you have ever read before. It's hard to describe a book that seemed to elude me for most of the time I was reading it. This is a story about a girl who got left behind, about friendships so unique they span years, and about identity. It's about the Jellicoe Road, which stays a constant to every character in the book tying them all together, like its not just a road, but a character in its own right. Melina has this way with words that just pulls you under leaving you with no choice but to immerse yourself in them. She builds her characters in a way that makes you wish you knew them. To Taylor who is blunt and hurt and afraid and kick ass in a way not a lot of teenage girls are. To Raf who is strong and sassy and has such a wonderful outlook on life. To Santangelo who's grown up in a woman's world and is all the more better for it. To Jonah, who's built like a tank and tastes of honey. To Hannah, who carries the book in a way I could never understand. To the people who lived on the Jellicoe Road, who know the true meaning of friendship, grief, understanding and love.

But here is what happened; I didn\u2019t understand what was going on in the book until I was in the middle of it. I even thought of abandoning the book but the writing was beautiful and kept me going. And when it started making sense, it was worth all the chaos. Things that I loved:As I mentioned earlier Jellicoe Road is definitely tough to get into but Melina Marchetta\u2019s writing will suck into this strange world where kids learn to protect theirs and take over others\u2019 land. I loved that all the characters had multiple layers and a deeper story. I loved that even before I understood the plot I got deeply invested into the lives of these kids that I couldn\u2019t stop reading.I am totally in love with the kids from 80s in the manuscript.The characters in Jellicoe Road deal with death, grief, abandonment, drugs addiction and suicide and I am sure for a Young Adult book this is too heavy. I am still confused whether to tag this one as Young Adult or contemporary or even a mystery. Things that didn\u2019t work for me:I am finally getting used to not searching for responsible adults in YA and you wouldn\u2019t find them in Jellicoe Road. And I am not gonna lie, it did feel like it took ages to understand who they were and what happened to them. Though I kinda guessed it about three-fourth into the story, but I am not going to complain. While I am happy at how things turned out for the three factions, I also am kinda annoyed that the story took huge diversion from that part of the story. There were times when the teenage angst and the whiny female lead got to me, but I am glad I chose to eye-roll and ignore them. Bottomline:If you are ready for a roller coaster ride that may or not end up in happy tears Jellicoe Road is the perfect YA for you.Blog | Facebook | Twitter |  Amazon |", "num_likes": 11, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["reviewed", "a-z2018", "fiction", "ya", "2018", "e-books", "suspense"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/730427051", "review_id": "730427051", "date": "Sep 29, 2013", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Ayesha", "user_url": "/user/show/8359556-ayesha", "text": "\u201cMy father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.

I remember asking, 'What\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.\u201d 5++++ stars because this brilliant novel deserves them!Do you want to get lost in the world of summer, trees, sunrise, sunset, friendship, love, memories, nostalgia which is constructed by lyrical writing, raw emotions and masterfully forged mystery? Then you should definitely read Jellicoe Road without further ado.I lived in this book. I fell for its characters. I fell in love with their friendship and story. I laughed with them. I cried with them and I died a little every time with them. \n I loved this book and it\u2019s going to be forever etched it my heart. \nFive stars and more are for books like this. I don\u2019t give special place to every book in my shelf right away. I don\u2019t give any book five stars like candy.  Books like Jellicoe Road show me a very different world, emotionally connect me to the characters, make me wonder about life, happiness, grief and in the end, teaches me something beautiful and devastating. This book first starts with a prologue of worlds colliding at Jellicoe Road which slowly grows into a powerful friendship. The story shifts between past, present and dreams. Initially, the plot may be confusing and you may not be sure where it takes you but as you continue, you\u2019ll see the story masterfully unravelling in front of your eyes. The constant shifting of present and the story from the past kept me intrigued and I couldn\u2019t stop turning pages fast enough. The past has a beautiful story about 5 best friends; Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz and the tragedy that befalls them.  \u201cAnd then their voices stopped and their souls stood still and they ceased being who they had been. Because who they were had always been determined by him.\u201dIn the present, we have Taylor Markham, 17, Jellicoe School student and reluctant leader of the territory wars that take place between Jellicoe School, Cadets from a school in Sydney and teens from the town. Taylor was abandoned at the age of 11 by her mother on Jellicoe road and rescued by Hannah, one of the House guardians of Jellicoe School. Past and present are inextricable and to understand her present better, Taylor is curious to know about her past and her search leads her to the tragic story of 5 best friends from the 80\u2019s.\u201cThese people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.\u201dEvery character in this book is created with so much emotions and depth to the point that they feel real. They have strengths, they have flaws, they have grief, they have happiness but all in all, they are bound by love. The plot is intricately designed, the writing is lyrical and the story is powerfully told. Even after re-reading this book several times, I've never got exhausted by this story.To put it simply, Jellicoe Road is a uniquely written masterpiece. It\u2019s my all-time favourite book along with The Book Thief. Everyone should read it with lots and lots of tissues and chocolates in handy. \u201cAnd life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.\u201d", "num_likes": 11, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["admirable-characters", "contemporary", "mystery", "amazing-plot", "books-i-fell-in-love-with", "beautiful-writing", "favourites", "books-that-should-be-more-popular", "best", "books-that-had-an-impact-on-me"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/94699041", "review_id": "94699041", "date": "Mar 18, 2010", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Annalisa", "user_url": "/user/show/542037-annalisa", "text": "What overwhelmed me in this book was that within the first few chapters, there is so much thrown at you that I couldn't process any of it. You have:-this school battle that sounds like it may be dystopian or apocalyptic (it's not) so you're trying unnecessarily to figure out this new world (and those of us who aren't Australian trying to figure out the school grade system).-you are introduced to all the characters right off the bat from all the houses at the boarding school plus cadets and townies and how they all relate together. I was worse than lost those first few chapters.-the story is periodically interrupted with italicized inserts of a whole new cast of characters you're not sure how they relate to the story or each other.-Taylor has vague dreams that don't make sense, plus a history of being abandoned by her mother that you know you're not getting the full story about.-Hannah has her own history she's not sharing and you can't quite figure out her relationship to Taylor or the school.-and a prologue from twenty years before (a beautiful introduction by the way), which I got later was related to the characters in the italicized inserts (duh, it's the same names) which made them so much more interesting once they had a foundation, but when everything was dumped on me at once, it took a good hundred pages before I wasn't confused at what characters were in what scenes and how everything related together and even half the time what was happening.The only things that kept me going were A) my own stubbornness (because this book has gotten such rave reviews and I was bound and determined to find out why) and B) Griggs. While I found Taylor a bit annoying, I was dying to crack Grigg's shell. I honestly don't know if I would have finished the book if it weren't for him, which is a shame because by midway, I was so caught up in Taylor's story, I finished it in a day. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I know if I went back and reread the book, it would be so much more poignant the second time around, but I'd rather have been caught up in the first time instead of being so frustrated.Once I understood all that Taylor is protecting inside, I wanted to protect her and help her along this journey to discover why she was abandoned by her mother years ago. I loved her relationships and some of the dialogue and in the end I cried for her. All the characters are endearing. It's that powerful and beautiful and tragic. And the ending is perfect.

Here's the thing: her writing is powerful and deeply emotional, and it's difficult not to gush, stare at the pile of tissues next to the reading chair and wonder how she managed to make you cry so often and like it, or otherwise succumb to a state somewhere between awe and stupor. I've learned to have high expectations every time I start one of her novels. I don't give a lot of five-star reviews; out of the last 80 or so books I've read, I've given five stars to seven, and three of them are Melina Marchetta novels. The beginning of this one, as several reviewers have pointed out, is a little bit confusing. There are two stories being told, a present-day narrative and a story about five teenagers in the past. In the present-day narrative, seventeen year-old Taylor Markham, whose mother abandoned her at a 7-11 when she was eleven, is the reluctant leader of the the boarders' faction in a school territory war between the boarders, Cadets, and Townies. \u201cHuh,\u201d I thought. \u201cMaybe this will be the Marchetta novel I don't end up loving.\u201dWRONG. Then I was sucked into the rabbit hole, completely captivated by the characters and their stories. Grief and guilt are major themes here; the stories of these teens are riddled with more tragedy than any young person should have to bear. It's almost too much weight for a narrative to bear, really. But while part of the point is that there's something about grief that is fundamentally lonely, Marchetta's characters typically refuse to let each other carry its burden without help. They get angry with each other, annoyed with each other. They might refuse to communicate with each other for a while, and at other times, they might not communicate very well. However, on a very basic level, one of this author's greatest talents is the representation of friendships held together by love, force of will, and sheer faith in the notion that the friend is worth the effort. It's part of why her secondary characters tend to be so endearing, and it's a major step in the growth arc for her each of her main characters. I don't know what else to say about this remarkable novel other than to speculate that if it doesn't emotionally affect a reader on at least some level, I have no idea what to do with that reader. I'd be tempted to make the sign of the horns for protection, go all Jenny-from-the-Outlander-series-in-a-bad-moment, and declare, \u201cYe have nae soul!\u201dOkay, kidding on that last part.Sort of.

It took a good \u00bc to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I\u2019m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn\u2019t be rereading this book in the near future, about \u00be the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy.

But when you think about the comparatively short time students spend there, it makes sense. No matter how ancient its foundation, no establishment - school, college, regiment, club, whatever - is really any older than its current most senior members, which in the case of most schools means four to six years. After that the only explanation for any local custom or observance would be, \u201cWe\u2019ve always done that.\u201d With the Jellicoe School, an Australian boarding school about 600 kilometres from Sydney & another kilometre this side of the Black Stump, the principal preoccupation is a form of mock combat called the Territory Wars, a three-sided struggle between the students of the Jellicoe School, the Townies - the teenagers who live in the nearby town itself - & the Cadets, boys bused out from a military school in Sydney to encamp for their annual field exercises. Some readers, probably mostly attracted by the story\u2019s relationships, find the Territory Wars a distraction. I loved them & thought they gave the school real distinction - without them, On the Jellicoe Road would be like Tom Brown\u2019s School Days without Rugby (duh!) football. The principal character & narrator, Taylor Markham, is the House Leader of one of the school dormitories, which makes her a caregiver & advisor for the junior girls, as well as a major strategist in the Territory Wars. She has a complicated & stormy emotional life, having been given away by her addict mother (@ a 7/ll store) to a woman named Hannah who acts as Taylor\u2019s guardian as well as being a kind of non-resident house supervisor. The rules for the Territory Wars are set down in a purple covered book which is passed on from one senior class to its successors. I\u2019m a bit vague on how they\u2019re conducted tho\u2019 eventually we discover their origin - they seem sort of like a large scale version of Capture the Flag with no flag fought for access to trails & to the river. Hostages are taken to effect the transfer of territory, but they, especially the younger girls, are treated with courtesy & respect. Violence seems to be limited to an occasional punch up amongst the boys & negotiations & peace talks occur with all the gravitas of Bismarck or Kissinger. But there is also a backstory, partly told in the form of a MS (printed here in italics) written by Hannah that Taylor is reading, that involves an earlier generation of characters who come to figure importantly in the present story as well. Besides her school life, Taylor has to deal with two other emotional relationships, her quest for the mother who abandoned her & her growing attachment to Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets. I loved this book & definitely ranked it in the top five school stories that I\u2019ve read by contemporary authors, alongside (in the order I read them) Patrick Gale\u2019s Friendly Fire, Megan Abbott\u2019s Dare Me, Anton DiSclafani's The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls, & Tana French\u2019s The Secret Place. Some of the parallels are striking: like Sophie in Friendly Fire, Taylor is in effect an orphan for whom her school is also her home & family. Like Dare Me & Yonahlossee, Jellicoe Road gives us miniature world in which competition is the principle of moral & spiritual formation - along with caregiving as in The Secret Place. In On the Jellicoe Road we see how a five-star book illumines those we\u2019ve already read. If you like school stories & you\u2019re not living in Australia, get hold of the audio version. Not only does Rebecca Macauley read it beautifully, but you\u2019ll hear Taylor & the other characters speaking in their own vernacular. Indeed, I enjoyed it so much that I\u2019ll be pleased to give my copy of the CD to the first GR friend who asks me for it, if you\u2019ll promise to pass it on to another reader to enjoy afterwards.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["the-secret-history", "five-stars-in-2015"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/164558880", "review_id": "164558880", "date": "Apr 30, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Joy (joyous reads)", "user_url": "/user/show/4352734-joy-joyous-reads", "text": "Nope.

Five months after...Have you ever been intimidated to write up a review of a book you just read?Where you scramble to find the right words to best describe the full experience of what you just went through but come up with a page-full of inadequate sentences and ramblings that made little sense? This was how I felt when I read Jellicoe Road. The first few pages of this book confused me. I remember thinking that maybe I was out of my depth and that I should stop and save it for a day when my mind wasn\u2019t so full of cobwebs. But there was just something about Narnie\u2019s silent tenderness that wouldn\u2019t let me stop. So I read; until the words off the pages became clearer and the characters of the book spoke with determined voices. I read until the book became a movie in my mind\u2019s eye and the heartaches became so visceral that reading became a cycle of starts and stops. But no matter how much time I gave myself, the characters\u2019 miserable plights became even more heartbreaking that I found myself tearfully wondering - why the heck was I putting my heart in an emotional blender? I am one of those readers who steer clear of angst and reality fiction for the simple fact that I read to escape. My life is real enough. I\u2019d rather read of rainbows and unicorns and slain dragons. But after reading Jellicoe, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that I was missing a whole lot.Before Jellicoe Road, I read Melina Marchetta\u2019s Saving Francesca and The Piper\u2019s Son first. Don\u2019t get me wrong, both books affected me in their own rights. But Jellicoe Road is something else altogether. Once I figured out the elaborate web of this novel, I learned to appreciate the overwrought and emotional journey that Melina Marchetta took me at the time. I love the way Melina made me fall in love with a character that to some may consider flawed beyond redemption.Take Tate Markham, for example. She fell apart because the love of her life died; so much so that she couldn\u2019t even stay sober for her child. She abused her body by any means necessary to stay numb. I found her selfish and weak, neglectful of the single person who should\u2019ve been her solace and salvation. But throughout the book, did I feel any contempt against her? The answer is, no. I found it difficult to get angry when all I could feel was her palpable loss. Melina Marchetta's writing is that potent. I could go on and on about every character in this book, but I\u2019d probably just end up repeating myself anyway. I read On the Jellicoe Road last May and it\u2019s taken me a while to actually write a proper review. I have been re-reading this on days when not a single book on my shelf looks enticing. I can honestly say that asking me to pick which among of Melina Marchetta\u2019s works is my favorite is like asking me to pick which of my two children do I love more. It\u2019s just wrong. This is an award-winning book that rightfully deserves all the accolades it\u2019s been getting. As for this review, all I can say is, I tried my best.", "num_likes": 10, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["favourites", "cant-put-these-down", "own", "marchettaisagod", "aussie", "aussome"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/140954559", "review_id": "140954559", "date": "Jan 15, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Cory", "user_url": "/user/show/3254923-cory", "text": "I did not enjoy On the Jellicoe Road. Yes, I said it.I don't think this book deserved the 2009 Printz. Not when the The Hunger Games was published that year. But I don't think Going Bovine and A Step from Heaven deserved the Printz either. The Printz is supposed to be the teen equivalent of the Newberry Award. This isn't YA. It has teenagers in it, but it isn't YA. I can't see teenagers enjoying it like they might enjoy Looking for Alibrandi, which in my opinion is the superior book. But I've realized that the Printz Award is awarded to books that adults wish teens would read, not necessarily those that they would enjoy. I'm not saying that Twilight should have gotten the 2006 Printz. Rather, I wish this book hadn't been marketed as YA, because it isn't.It took me two months to finish it. The first 100 pages are very difficult to read through the first time around. I can't imagine most teens finishing the book, let alone getting past the first chapter. The story doesn't pick up until 1/3rd of the way through. Pacing is a major issue. Honestly, I wouldn't have finished this if I hadn't read Marchetta's debut. And the unabashed praise surrounding Marchetta was also persuaded me to stick through to the end. As a protagonist, Taylor is functional. She's neither brilliant nor depressing. She just exists, and I guess that's part of the problem. She doesn't have a well pronounced voice. Jossie, from Looking for Alibrandi, had a voice. Taylor has a whisper. She isn't memorable, which is why I wasn't running to finish Jellicoe.I didn't like Jonah Griggs. I heard some of you scream in anguish. Sorry, but it's true. Sure, he was throwing himself a constant pity party, and he was supposed to be ridiculously handsome, but I didn't like him. Much like I didn't like Jacob in Looking for Alibrandi, I didn't like Jonah Griggs. Their romance was kind of bleh. Their relationship rubbed me the wrong way.The inter-weaved plot lines didn't work for me. I would have rather Marchetta focused on either Taylor or Hannah. Both didn't work for me. Also, the family plot line and the territory plot line were a random fit. What did one have to do with the other? Favorite character: Either Ben, Chaz, or Sam. Sam's story, and consequently Taylor's backstory, was really grating. I would have rather the novel focused on them. That, I thought, was sad, not Jonah's tragic abuse story. I hate when characters are excused for their actions because of their tragic pasts. 2.5 stars. This wasn't for me.

Melina Marchetta has a masterful way with words. Her writing is simple and yet effective. She\u2019s down to earth, whilst being thought provoking. Lamb dressed as mutton. I could go into a plot summary for you, but I think it would ruin the experience; therefore, I\u2019ll say this:There is a story within a story that inevitably intertwines the past to the present, and both are vivid and remarkably told. The dust jacket and/or blubs will present this book as a mystery, but to be frank, that\u2019s a bit false. All mystery dissipates 150 pages in, with the first 50 pages being a bit of a confusing mess. I\u2019ll admit, I had my doubts about Jellicoe Road in the beginning. The narrative hops around way too often, in no seeming order, and there were times when I had no idea who was speaking. But I pressed on, hoping that the story would reveal itself in time if I could only endure for a little longer. I\u2019ll note here that Marchetta has this way of luring you in against your will. In this instance, I was compelled by Taylor Markham, even though there were times that I was a bit put out with her. She\u2019s just so lost, so solitary, so angry and she\u2019s been so betrayed. You want to slap her, then give her a hug. Though, as Marchetta has proven with her other works, her narrator is never the only character to shine albeit they shine through a rain cloud as her characters are almost always emotional train wrecks.

It is Australian Melina Marchetta's third book and the first of hers I've read. A fault that will have to be remedied quickly as I absolutely loved this knotty, painful, beautiful book. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School--a backwoods boarding school located somewhere in Australia. Abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, Taylor was taken in by a mysterious woman named Hannah and installed at the school. Now eighteen, Taylor is embroiled in turf wars between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets. But when Hannah up and leaves without a word, Taylor is convinced it has something to do with her mother and with a horrific accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road twenty-two years before. Past and present become harder to discern as the story unfolds. Simultaneously obsessed with and terrified of finding out what happened and just how closely it is tied to her own fragmented life, Taylor is forced to form alliances with the leaders of her rival gangs, including Cadet leader Jonah Griggs with whom she shares a confusing and painful history. This story grabbed me by the throat and shook me until I begged for mercy. Parts of it read almost stream of consciousness and you have to just let it wash over you as characters and histories distill and become clearer on the page and in your mind at about the same pace they do for Taylor herself. And by the time the wars really begin, you are so invested it's impossible to extricate yourself from the world Marchetta has created. Fortunately you don't want to. I was charmed by the dust and heat of the Australian summer, the layered language with its overtones of fear and longing, and the periodic chapters detailing the story of five children who were determined to survive after the world ended.

Then in between chapters we get the second story told in third person that follows a group of friends after they share a traumatic experience. Over the book, these two stories merged in such a way that it will leave you speechless. And that is where the magic of this book lies.So why not five stars? To be honest, I had a really hard time getting into the book initially. Marchetta throws you in with little no background or explanations and there seemed to be no solid ground to grab onto. I didn't understand the townie vs cadets vs students war that was going on or how it was so violent with no consequences. And I also didn't warm up to Taylor right away. She's a very prickly character who seems to care for no one - not even herself. As the story goes on, we get to know more about her and eventually I understand her actions. It was a bold choice to start the novel this way and ultimately it's why I gave it four stars.My absolute favorite part of this story was the past glimpses. That group of five kids just broke my heart and when I discovered the secrets and how they fit into the present, I was a sobbing mess.

I cried.\" I can't give this book five stars, no matter how much I liked the ending or how much a re-read helps because my first read of the first 2/3rds of the book wasn't a good experience. I forced myself to finish it and you should never feel that way about a five star book so here's a review, eyes wide open.Jellicoe Road tells two stories, separated by decades, and neither of them was initially compelling for me. The story the highly quotable opening lines come from the first, older story. The first story set events in motion that the second story relies on. Unfortunately Melina Marchetta tells the first story like an asshole. I'm sorry, I tried to think of a better way to put it, but even my best alternative was just a watered down rephrasing of the asshole sentiment. Marchetta deliberately muddles a complicated series of events. She constantly obscures how the stories connect. It became frustrating, felt unnecessary, and really detracted from my experience. To stop you from connecting the stories too fast the characters that appear in both stories have two names. Yeah, characters. If it had to be done then it should've only been done once. I enjoy thinking while I read, but I don't enjoy crossword puzzles either.I experienced a bit of name soup in each individual story. There were so many character's running back in Taylor's story, the present day story, that I sort of gave up. There are little girls running around all of whom Taylor is responsible for, other house heads, her friends, the townies, and the military camp group. When you tack on a secondary story with characters who have nicknames and unrevealed proper names it just became too much. I don't think it was me because I've been perfectly capable of keeping track of a large cast before. Also, I had similar feelings about the cast of Saving Francesca.Taylor's story involves the territory wars -- a game the students at the Jellicoe school play against the townies and the military school, but the game is taken very seriously for some reason. Since these games only go on while the military school is out there doing training I never felt the game was as life or death as it felt to the characters. They had to tolerate each other for six (or was it eight?) weeks a year. The fact that the wars were so temporary made me really uninterested in negotiations between the various factions. I didn't get why it was such a big deal for the townies to get access to \"the clubhouse\" if the military school would be gone in a few weeks. It felt like a frivolous thing to invest so many pages on and I could tell the author went back and forth a little on how important the 'wars' were. At one point Taylor marvels at being in a place for the first time in years because they'd lost the territory back then and at other points she says they only actually have to be careful while the military school is around... Well, which is it?The end of the book connects a lot of people and events. It made little snippets of conversation or things peppered through the book come together. Re-reading I saw more connective stuff like 'oh there's the purple notebook' and 'oh mention of the postman,' but I wish this stuff had stuck with me enough to enjoy it all at the conclusion. Of course, if I hadn't found so much of it bloody inane I might have begun to guess at the importance of certain things earlier.There are some timeline things that made no sense to me, like Jessa knowing about the tunnels. Her mother died when she was two and her father lived as a hermit in the woods for years afterward. She doesn't know he was the hermit or that he died. It's implied he didn't stick around long after her mother died because he was afraid of tainting her. Hannah found her in foster care and brought her to Jellicoe, yet somehow her father who had been out of her life for a significant period of time let her know there was a secret tunnel in her dorm building? Eh... No. Unlikely. There were several dorm buildings and her father never knew Jessa while she lived at the school so I think it's all just a little too unlikely.As for the characters, Marchetta made my heartbreak for Tate even though I hated her. She made me feel the tragedy in Hannah wanting to live even after her brother died. She made me want Jonah for Taylor and Hannah's happy ending. I cried more than a little over an apology that needed no forgiveness and the author made the unfinished house from the beginning of the novel into a dream for me too. The conclusions of the book, even the serial killer story, made the rest of the novel worthwhile, but it doesn't blind me to the flaws or how difficult it was for me to slog through some of it. I think it's a good book, but unfortunately I didn't have a religious experience over it.", "num_likes": 9, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["coming-of-age", "gloomy", "romance", "young-adult", "better-than-i-expected", "printz"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/132480707", "review_id": "132480707", "date": "Nov 26, 2010", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Alyssa", "user_url": "/user/show/2753251-alyssa", "text": "Here it sits, right on my desk, taunting me with all its excellence. It\u2019s teasing me, asking me to open it right back up again so I dip my head into the strong, lyrical verses of Marchetta\u2019s writing so I can fall in love and hate with the characters all over again.Taylor Markham is a confused young woman. She was dropped off at some random 7-Eleven when she was just a kid by her druggie mother, and once she left the washrooms, was taken to the Jellicoe School by this woman who, throughout Taylor\u2019s life, becomes the closest thing she has to a mother. But Taylor\u2019s life at the Jellicoe School isn\u2019t so great. Most of the children who attend don\u2019t have families and are there because they\u2019ve got nowhere else to go. Not to mention to territory wars between the two other sects of that area. (Note: this is where I comment on the confusion that takes place in the first 100 pages. Don\u2019t worry; it all clears up later.) Taylor becomes the leader of the territory wars when she\u2019s seventeen, a senior, and months away from graduating, it is finally when life begins to get even more complicated.Taylor was such a strong heroine. Some didn\u2019t like her very much, but I found her voice to be true to her situation and found her quite accurately filling out the shoes for someone in her position. Her actions really made me think \u2013 most of the time, it seemed, she was performing an action over talking, but everything she did sufficed in making her life seem believable. At some points in the story, she made me feel like throwing myself in front of a zooming train for her, and during other points, I felt like hugging her to my chest to stop her breaking sobs.Griggs was so magical, so loving and heartbreaking and loyal and fantastic\u2026I couldn\u2019t breathe whenever he spoke. He had some of the most romantic lines I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life, and forgive me, Taylor, but I was just so jealous of you. Griggs was everything you look for in a romantic partner, and even though he had his flaws, he seemed complete to me. Although Marchetta never went out and said he was extremely handsome or anything like that, the way I looked at him was with a blurry line crossing from beautiful to just an average guy whose heart could beat, too, and I loved seeing him like that. The supporting characters were so fabulous, and I\u2019m talking about everyone who was anyone in this book. From Ben to the Mullet Brothers, I was happy (or furious, whichever it called for) with everyone. Although this story was told from Taylor\u2019s POV, a key plot of this book was with a cast one generation older, the cast that makes up everything Taylor needs. I won\u2019t spoil this review in giving away any details, but those supporting characters, and the story they had to share, was absolutely indescribable, and I cried and laughed along with them in turn.Earlier on in this review, I said that there were some foggy, slow part in the book that made others put this down. Although I never really found the story to be moving on too slowly, I will say this book, no matter how beautiful, is not for the impatient. The first 120 pages, before the book really begins to shine, is confusing, muddy, and although well written, just as mind boggling as the emotions that run through Taylor\u2019s body the entire book. Warning: this book also isn\u2019t for those who hate the heavy. Reading this is like dropping a box of hardcover books onto your back and then having to cross a desert with them there \u2013 it\u2019s tear-jerking, unexpected, romantic, mysterious and questionable.I loved this book with all my heart and feel like, although I just finished it, reading it again to pick on all those little lines again. The highest praise I can give ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is a five-star rating, but even so, I wish it was more. More like a hundred. JELLICOE ROAD, without telling a lie, is the best book I have ever read, and is absolutely recommended. *Because this book had so many fantastic lines, I\u2019ll share one shining quote with you, the one that stood out the most.\u201cHe shakes his head and, although it\u2019s dark, I can tell he\u2019s crying.\u2018What are you thinking?\u2019 I whisper after a while.\u2018That you deserve romance,\u2019 he says.Page 237On the Jellicoe Road by Melina MarchettaAudience: 14+ (sex, drugs, alcohol, suicide, and some older youth audience reading)Rating: 5/5 Recommend?: Yes in all languages.

Careful, it gets quite catchy.)Totally unrelated (though hopefully funny) story aside, here's the review! (You: Finally!)Jellicoe Road by Australian author Melina Marchetta is set as a dual narrative, a technique which I have loved ever since I read Holes. It starts out sort of like a puddle of string, entangled in itself, with you hardly knowing what to do with them, but somehow, somewhere along the book these little string ends start finding each other and connecting and forming something beautiful and perfect that absolutely makes sense. It's hard to understand my explanation, but really, it's my subconscious channeling you to read it stat. As you journey with Taylor and Co., everything seems complicated but wait until you read the final pages. Ahh, so that's why this happened. You may find the resolution a bit long, but it's okay because it ties up all the loose ends which leave you in no doubt regarding the fates of the characters, while maintaining a little ambiguity as you wonder what happens to them beyond the book's scope.Feelings-wise, I think this book is so... passionate. Powerful. Intense. It comes across to me that way, not because of the vivid imagery or the intricate plot, but because of all the emotions the characters are feeling. I measure a book by how it evokes feelings in me, and this book takes home all the awards because I think it made me feel everything I could possibly feel at my age. I read this at the end of my college summer semester, where I felt like a prune, numb and empty from all the schoolwork and literally sleepless nights, but this book managed to make me feel good, which is not at all unwelcome (I'm like a grape now. Sorry for the food analogy, I just want to eat some grapes.) Wow, Marchetta.Also, Taylor Markham and Jonah Griggs both possess strong personalities, which definitely adds to the passion + tension + overall intensity of the story in a lot of ways. It makes for an interesting dynamic.But here's the thing: what really did me in was the prose. Marchetta's writing contains a flowy, dreamlike quality that is part witty and part poignant, among other things. It's an interesting combination that manifests itself several times in the text. Like this quote, for example:And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die. But there's a joy and an abundance of everything, like information and laughter and summer weather and so many stories.There are several others, believe me, but I didn't have the foresight to write them down because I was too busy reading everything that I finished the book in a day. It is THAT good. If it is not obvious yet, Jellicoe Road is something I DEFINITELY recommend you to read! The experience is nothing short of magical, as all dreams are, no matter bad or good. :)", "num_likes": 9, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2012", "5-stars", "owned", "young-adult", "award-winning"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/164075612", "review_id": "164075612", "date": "Apr 27, 2011", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Monique", "user_url": "/user/show/4111021-monique", "text": "Done reading but I'll withhold rating/writing my thoughts on it until after May 19. :D Posting my review now. It's not like my thoughts on the book have much sway on fellow readers. Original post  here.The connection? No, it wasn't all that difficult to figure out. In fact, I had fun with it. It's just like the matching type examinations in school, way back when. I appreciated the mystery and the hint of suspense, of course. It's one aspect of fiction that I thrive in. And even if I did figure out early on that Melina Marchetta was actually narrating two stories - one from the past, one from the present - and that they will eventually tie up in the end, I enjoyed reading this nonetheless. Jellicoe Road is a heartwarming story about friendship, family, love, death and loss, coming to terms with life's trials, and the ties that bind ~ all the important things that transcend time, space and distance. It's what I truly appreciated about the novel, actually. The author begins the story with something just a tad trivial - territory wars - and then comes out strong in the end with all the stuff that matter. The first half is a meandering mess, but the storyline builds up somewhere in the middle so that by the time you get to the second half of the book, you'll be so hooked you'll be unable to put it down. :) Unfortunately, much as I would like to expound on my observations, I highly doubt that I could give an accurate description without revealing too much of the plot, and we really don't want that. Like Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, this book is highly spoilery (is there such a word?), and I don't want to be the one to kill the fun. The writing wasn't exceptional, but I liked its simplicity and straightforwardness. The characters? Well, there were times when I thought Taylor Markham was such a drama queen, but then I try to put myself in her shoes, and while I know I can never relate to her, I think I can comprehend where all the angst was coming from. Jonah Griggs would never be a \"literary crush\" in a million years, but he is perfect for Taylor, and they sincerely deserved each other. Everyone else - Raffaela, Chaz, Hannah, the Brigadier, etc. - were secondary personalities that helped build and shape Taylor's character. The Great Reveal - well, more like Great Reveal in Installments - didn't shock me as much as I thought it would, however. I think that I read through the chapters more for the purpose of confirming what I already know, and it didn't really blow me away. Still, it tugged at my emotions; the realizations and acknowledgments in the end broke my heart, and I appreciated people's histories and how these can change lives, in a major way. Because, more than anything, Jellicoe Road is Taylor Markham's journey to self-discovery, and the story of acceptance of the people around her.

I'm formally changing my 4 star rating to a 5 star one. I also still love Jonah Griggs with my entire heart.\nIt happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.\nIt's hard to review a book that you really like because it's so difficult to give it the justice it deserves. Melina Marchetta is an incredibly underrated author, who has a gift for crafting realistic voices for her teen characters. Her characters are flawed and she puts them through the emotional wringer, but Marchetta never allows it to get melodramatic. There's a perfect balance of the exploration of family, friendship, and romance. Marchetta's prose is absolutely beautiful. Seriously, I have so many lines highlighted on my Kobo. I don't really know what to say other than how I loved creatively and beautifully Marchetta wove all of her characters together. All of them are connected in some way, and go on their own emotional journeys. No character in this novel is left one-dimensional. Plus Jonah Griggs is a new favourite literary boy of mine. Just saying. \nSome of my favourite quotes:\n\u201cTaylor Markham,\" said Raffaela, \"I'm going to say a prayer for you.\" And although I wanted to mock her and explain I didn't believe in anything or anyone, I realised that no one had ever prayed for me before. So I let her.\u201dAccording to Dickens, the first rule of human nature is self-preservation and when I forgive him for writing a character as pathetic as Oliver Twist, I'll thank him for the advice.\u201cSo apart from writing letters home to your fantasy girlfriends,\"Ben says, walking backwards, \"what do you guys do out here without television and phones?\"\"Men's business. Bit confidential,\" Griggs says patronizingly.\"Wow, wish I were you,\" Ben says, shaking his head with mock regret. \"All I'll be doing tonight is hanging out in Taylor's bedroom, lying on her bed, sharing my earphones with her, hoping she won't hog all the room because it's such a tiny space.\u201d\u201cWhat are you so sad about?

I already know I'm not going to do it justice...so bare with me, as I try not to butcher it.Jellicoe Road is the past and present coming together to create one manginificently beautiful tale, full of grief and heartache and hope.I'm not gonna lie, this book is a hard hard read. If it's not the interlacing of two different stories, then it's the tragedies that these characters, from two different times, face. Trust me, the writing is pretty much impeccable. The bits of story we get about the past are confusing because Marchetta wants them to be...it's all part of the suspense of the book and ultimately adds to the climax of it. I think the confusion is really just mystery and gives us suspense.I would compare this book to a psychological thriller film. It's one of those where you're like, \"Am I supposed to know what's going on? Because I'm completely lost. Or stupid.\" But then at the END it all comes together and makes perfect sense and you can't believe you were oblivious to the brilliance occuring right in fron of you because the whole thing has been amazing!!!!!After I read this, I layed in bed like a comatose patient, unable to move due to an incredible overdose of grief and sadness. It's not that the book has a sad ending, it's just that when I reflected on EVERYTHING these characters had to go through I felt miserable for them. Another confession....I sobbed. Horribly. At least 3 times in this book.It was really an emotional journey that I went on with this book, as cheesy as that may sound to anyone....it's true. A raw, emotional, exhausting journey. This was a hard read because of the content, but worth it and an extremely compelling journey. Seriously, my new favorite book.So do myself, and yourself, and Melinca Marchetta a favor and go out right this minute and buy this book.

This is a frequently five starred novel, but I think I went into this with all the wrong expectations.The story follows a girl named Taylor Markham who was abandoned by her mother. She is the leader of her house in their war games (a significant plot in the novel), which is complicated by her blossoming romance with Jonah, one of the other leaders. On top of that, the person Taylor is closest to, Hannah, has disappeared, leaving behind snippets of her novel which may contain more truth than fiction.I guess I just assumed this was a contemporary novel written in a normal format, but the way the narrative was structured was extremely confusing to me. Hannah\u2019s story is interspersed with Taylor\u2019s, and for most of the novel I had no clue what the point of Hannah\u2019s story was. It comes together in the end, but as a reader who prefers a more linear format, the way the novel was presented just didn\u2019t work for me.I can see where others got such enjoyment out of this book - it's a highly emotional story, but also ambiguous in a way that can be rewarding once you piece the story together.Despite its strong points, this one just wasn't for me. I personally didn't feel enough of a connection to the characters to feel invested. Coupled with the annoyingly confusing nature of the story, I didn\u2019t get much enjoyment out of this.I also really hated the whole war games plot line - by far the least interesting part of the novel.I\u2019ll say I\u2019m kinda bummed that Jellicoe Road didn\u2019t work for me, since it has been on my TBR for years and one I had always assumed would be a favorite once I actually got my hands on it.Recommended for patient readers who won\u2019t mind being confused for a large portion of the story, as well as fans of YA contemporary that deals with heavy themes.", "num_likes": 9, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2-star"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/332136154", "review_id": "332136154", "date": "May 18, 2012", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Ranee", "user_url": "/user/show/299871-ranee", "text": "I give a pat on my own shoulder for learning that I could do these things: 1) reading while on a moving vehicle either on land, air or water; 2) reading while on a drinking spree (I excuse myself from time to time to finish a chapter); and 3) finishing this book while enjoying the sands of Boracay.How should I feel about this book? As a travel buddy, this book kept me awake. It failed to bore me long enough to leave it inside my bag. In fact, as I was trekking the mountains of Mambukal, I can't help but look for my own Jellicoe road, the type where the canopies of the nearby trees form a tunnel. The type where I would set my eyes on the five friends bonded by fate. Sadly, my gaze did not meet anyone with the eyes that seemed to belong to Narnie but it did not lack smiles through which for a brief moment I connected with. As days crept on, so did my curiosity for these five friends who, I believe are the real heroes and heroines of this novel. This is their history, present and future. Everything that made Jellicoe Road rich in amusing events and games were created by these fab five. Their presence have etched too deep into the hearts of the townpeople including the police, the mayor and etcetera that their lives seemed to eveolve aroudn them. Taylor, the supposed heroine of this story stood out as an important link in the completion of their fate. It felt like I prowled into Taylor's diary who was then retracing her heritage to cope with her identity crisis and occasionally bumping into those entries where she wrote about her crush/lover. I guess, if Marchetta did not explore the story of these five friends, Taylor's diary would be common.This is readable and enjoyable.

On the Jellicoe Road is technically a YA book, and certainly it is a coming-of-age story with adolescent characters. However, the term 'YA' somehow feels pejorative when describing this book because this story (these characters, this plot) just feels bigger than that. This is not a book for lazy readers. It is intricately plotted, weaving between the past and the present, and for the first 100 pages or so it's difficult to grasp all of the characters. The mystery is deliberate, though, and the reader is feeling the same confusion that the book's protagonist Taylor Markham does. Taylor is 17, and the reluctant head of house at a boarding school for children from troubled backgrounds. Her background is complicated, murky, painful; she was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road at age 11 by her drug-addicted mother. Hannah rescued her, but who is Hannah? Friend, guardian, substitute mother? Hannah lives in a half-built school by the river, next door to the school. At the beginning of this story, she disappears - leaving no explanation - and this is part of Taylor's emotional unravelling, but also the catalyst for a journey (both literal and figurative) of self-discovery.The Jellicoe Road School is somewhere out in the bush of Australia, but it borders a town. The Townie kids, the Cadets and the boarding school kids have been engaged for decades in a complicated turf war. There are shades of the Outsiders in this aspect of the novel, although it's not nearly so much about poverty/class - and nor are the divisions between the three groups so insurmountable. Indeed, Taylor has a complicated history with Jonah Griggs - the leader of the Cadets; and her best friend Raffy (a Townie) has a complicated history with Chaz Santangelo, the leader of the Townies. At first I wasn't convinced about this aspect of the plot - I was afraid of a 'Lord of the Flies' scenario - but it is handled so deftly, and Marchetta connects it to the past in a way that is immensely satisfying. The book begins with an accident on the Jellicoe Road: two cars are in a head-on collision, and two families are nearly wiped out. If you do read this book, read this passage carefully. Read it several times, and commit it to memory. The past storyline and the present storyline merge together in a way that is, frankly, ingenious. The emotional impact of it is intense. About halfway though the book, as I began to make connections and predictions, I became intensely invested in Taylor's journey in figuring out who she is and how she is connected to the other characters. In many ways, this is a tragic book; nearly all of the characters in the book are damaged, and it is beyond what is realistic to for them to be made completely whole again. However, it is also a hopeful book - and it takes love, loyalty and friendship very seriously. Adolescence is an emotionally intense time anyway, and this book understands that and gives the reader emotionally intensity which is both authentic and earned. Highly, highly recommended. Marchetta is one of my favourite YA authors, and this book deserves 'classic' status.

The only other five-star book I read in 2012 was Once Was Lost, and that was way back at the beginning of the year-- so I guess you could say I was overdue for an amazing read. In lieu of writing a normal review, I thought I'd make a list of the ten moments or... aspects, I guess, that lingered or stood out in some way. Because, as anyone who's read this book knows, Jellicoe Road is so beautiful and haunting that writing a regular review of it is far too daunting a task. (I didn't include any real spoilers in the review, but I did put some stuff under spoiler tags just to preserve the reading experience as much as possible-- if you click them, it won't ruin the ending or anything.) So without further ado, here are the ten things that, a week after reading, my mind still won't let go of.10. Poor Sam. He breaks my heart, especially because he's probably only 14 or 15 years old himself-- this boy is in desperate need of some help. His role in the book is minimal, but his impact was not.9. Santangelo. (You will be seeing quite a few secondary characters on this list.) His evolution over the course of the novel was natural and gorgeous. I knew from almost the moment he was introduced that I would be keeping an eye on him, and my how that paid off!(view spoiler)[Favorite Santangelo moment:\"It's like when I was in year eight and we had to study The Diary of Anne Frank. I mean, she died of typhoid. Can you believe it? How could Anne Frank die of typhoid? The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying, and it was like nothing could kill what was inside of her. I thought, okay, maybe a gas chamber or a firing squad could kill her but not an illness that other people survived.\"I'm very disturbed to find out that the leader of the Townies has a soul and I'm beginning to develop a bit of a crush on him.Me, too, Taylor. (hide spoiler)]8. The Prayer Tree. I found it to be a symbol of home for many of the characters, especially Taylor and Raffy. It was a marker of the past and, somehow, the characters were able to connect at the Prayer Tree in a way that they couldn't elsewhere. It brought people together, even when time and prejudice seemed to separate them.7. This quote.He's the most beautiful creature I have ever seen and it's not about his face but the life force I can see in him. It's the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he's saying, \"Here I am, world; are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?\" Except the boy is dead... It makes me want to yell at the God that I wish I didn't believe in. For hogging him all to himself. I want to say, You greedy God. Give him back. I needed him here.This is probably the moment where the tears started forming, and they never really went away.6. I already mentioned Santangelo, but I have not yet dwelt on Raffy. She was a wonderful friend to Taylor, and even more than that I loved watching Raffy and Santangelo's interactions. Loved. Marchetta never clearly spelled out what their history was, but in the end I don't think that was the point. When Santangelo ate Raffy's pickles, I swooned a little. (There's something I never thought I'd say.) 5. The fifth tin. I hate it.4. Oh my oh my the friendships in this book made my little heart melt. There was the perfect mix of hilarious camaraderie and touching earnestness. (view spoiler)[Hilarious camaraderie:\"We can give you a lift,\" [Santangelo] says grudgingly. Griggs is looking straight ahead as if he doesn't give a shit.\"But just say we get finger marks on the seats?\" I ask. \"Can we borrow your hanky?\"Raffy and I are both amused by my humour.\"Just don't touch anything.\"Touching earnestness:Do I remember what Raffaela said in the car park of the Evangelical church?\"Who do I believe in?\" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. \"I believe in you, Taylor Markham.\"So beautiful. The interactions of Taylor, Jonah, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben made me alternately laugh and sigh. (hide spoiler)] 3. Taylor's voice was unique and I loved being in her head. She has this wry sense of humor that is so engaging, and I was quite drawn to her no-nonsense attitude, prickly personality, and the way she tried to suppress her own longings. 2. The magical realism of Taylor's dreams was just... gah. So good. The boy in the tree, the wailing-- it was all so haunting and really got under my skin.1. Hee hee... this will strike most of you as a strange favorite aspect of the book, but for some reason I was drawn to the silly little rivalry between Griggs and Ben. I think it was because they both were important to Taylor, yet had completely different personalities, Jonah being self-contained and intense, Ben being sarcastic and self-deprecating. (Loved. Ben.) There is nothing I would love more than to see a burgeoning bromance between these fine young men.(view spoiler)[For this reason, one of my favorite, favorite parts of the book was when Griggs saw Ben playing the violin and kinda-sorta apologized for messing up his fingers earlier. Hello there, let me just type out the entire exchange because it lights up my soul.When it's time for Ben to play his solo-- his eyes closed, his mind anywhere but here, his fingers so taut and precise that it almost looks painful-- my eyes well with tears. Because you know from the look on Ben's face that he's somewhere you want to be... The place goes off. I can feel Griggs's shoulder against mine and I hear him mutter something under his breath.\"What?\" I say, irritated. \"He's fantastic.\"There's a look on his face that I don't recognise and I don't quite get it until Ben jumps off the stage, surrounded by Townie girls.\"Hey!\" Griggs calls out to him. \"Violin guy!\"Ben points to himself with that who me? look, walking towards us.Griggs doesn't say anything for a moment, but then he clears his throat. \"If I had known... I wouldn't have gone for your fingers that time.\"D'awwwww.Also, in my frenzy of obsession upon finishing the book I read tons of interviews from MM. In one, she delivered this shocking revelation: Ben and Jonah will one day be roommates. I read that and then fell over dead with cuteness and wonder. Goodbye everybody, I must go pray fervently for a short story to someday be published detailing their life and times together in Waterloo. Ahhhh.

I'm not articulate enough but still, let me try. Melina Marchetta has written a book about two sets of young people who have lost much in life. Taylor Markham is abandoned by her mother at eleven outside a 7/11, to be picked up by a complete stranger and placed in a boarding school called the Jellicoe School. She grows up having no identity because the two people who should give her one are gone. She spends the next six years being angry and aloof and not allowing herself to become too hopeful about good things. Narnie, Webb and Tate lose their parents at twelve when their cars collide in a terrible accident out on the Jellicoe road. They are left to fend for themselves, along with their new psycho-hero-friend Fitz and the ever reliable Jude. A tragic story for all of them and I was sad, I really was but I was surprised that the strongest emotion I felt was envy. I was envious of them. Not for having suffered so much, but for having each other. They are left alone with no one to guide them or love them. So they guide and love each other instead. What I love about Marchetta's writing, and I've loved it ever since reading Saving Francesca, is how harrowing her stories are but she smooths the edges of impact by doing it with gentle hands. Its subtle and simple but so painfully honest that its elegant. Its not fancy words but what she observes; its how she sees the world that makes her writing poetic, not necessarily the way she's telling her story. Taylor, and again I felt this way about Francesca and Tom in The Piper's Son, is a specific part of us. She's that quality that makes us react against those who care about us, that makes us push them away because we don't want to seem vulnerable. We piss them off but inside we're praying they see through it and realize that we do need help, and more than that, we're lonely and can't live without them. We throw everything we have at them but hope they'll be the ones to crack the walls we've trapped ourselves in. She's our anger, uncertainty and aloneness and yearning. And then Taylor does us a favor and she cracks. She breaks open completely and demands from the world everything she wants. She demands and takes and in then end, I hope she wins. I know this isn't making sense anymore so if you'd like to move on, feel free to leave me here. I'll keep going, if you don't mind, until I've unloaded all I have in my head and my chest because I just, have to. Marchetta writes an adolescence I wish I had the guts to have had. Her characters are so well-drawn. From Taylor, Raffaela, Santangelo and Jonah Griggs to Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude and Fitz...its quite a group to keep track of. But you do because when they come on the page, they're not characters but feelings. Sad feelings, a lot of the time, but strong and they won't let you forget them. To expose yourself in the way they do, what they reveal of themselves to each other is both admirable and enviable (that word again). Let's just say, its hard enough to do as an adult. I certainly didn't speak so unreservedly and meditatively about myself at that age. But I wish I had. It all comes back to this quote (which if you\u2019re not too anal isn\u2019t really a spoiler) (view spoiler)[\n  \n\"We end up with the Townies and Cadets at the McDonald's on the highway at two in the morning. I look around at everyone and can't help thinking how normal we look and I don't think I've ever felt normal. I watch Raffy as she removes the pickles from her hamburger and hands them over to Santangelo without them exchanging a word, and I realize there is more to that relationship than spelling bees and being enemies. These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking. Jonah Griggs takes my hand under the table and links my fingers with his, and I know I would sacrifice almost anything to keep this state of mind, for the rest of the week at least.\"\n\n(hide spoiler)]. Its about belonging and I think that's ultimately what Marchetta is writing about. Don't get me wrong, this book is overflowing with serious life lessons. She talks about sacrifice, acceptance, redemption, guilt, keeping promises, perseverance, so many things. But belonging and solace, she says it right there in Chapter One. Throughout the story we find Taylor belonging more than she thought she did to people and places she never would've guessed. And the ending ends peacefully enough. As much peace that can be gotten from all the tragic events she puts her characters through.With all of that said, its not a perfect novel. But what is, I ask you. What is! Yes, like many complain, its a rocky start. But you survive. I love the opening lines so much that I would've endured a hundred more pages of jerky narrative. The plot was impressively tied together. The mysteries, however, weren't quite as mysterious. I would call many of the plot twists early on after which I would smack myself for my own damn cleverness. The territory wars...a melodramatic ploy, in my honest opinion. It was all a very long laugh that they took too seriously. But Taylor's inevitable connection to it later in the novel is sweetly satisfying. Another point to Marchetta's well-connected dots! This novel is just impossible to put down. Its not that you force yourself to stay awake, its more like you sit and read and forget to stop. You think a minute has gone by but suddenly you\u2019re squinting your eyes because the light has dimmed. Has the sun set already? I still don\u2019t know if Jellicoe is real, or if there is a Jellicoe school that served as inspiration for her novel, but all of these characters found something of themselves in this seemingly inconsequential town...to commemorate a place like that the way she does is amazing. Its as if any place in the world can suddenly be beautiful. I try to stay away from grand proclamations because I\u2019m constantly changing my mind and so my feelings and opinions shift in kind, but such gestures are to be expected when you read someone as good as Melina Marchetta. So I\u2019ll say this now, she\u2019s my favourite young adult writer, full stop. A few come a very close second, like Malorie Blackman and Carolee Dean, both to whom I\u2019m devoted after only one book and J.K. Rowling, of course. How can I not when she owns my entire childhood, which she keeps in pretty jars along with the rest of the childhoods of my generation? (Also, to be fair, I\u2019ve only just this year started reading YA, so I\u2019m sure there are hordes of other great authors for me to discover).And finally I think the reason why I love and envy Marchetta so much is that she writes compellingly the very stories I wish I could.", "num_likes": 8, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["this-shelf-is-divine", "identity-and-psychology", "ok-fine-its-ya", "goosebumps", "hit-me-in-the-heart", "own", "21st-cent"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/319990269", "review_id": "319990269", "date": "Apr 27, 2012", "rating": 3, "user_name": "AennA", "user_url": "/user/show/7339302-aenna", "text": "This isn't a marketing blurb, so expect a spoiler.I feel indifferent for this book. That\u2019s the trouble when I read stories discussing the issues of teenagers. Good thing this book talked about values of friendship and family, or else I couldn\u2019t find anything good to like about this book. I can imagine negative comments on this review, and yeah, bring it on.What I don\u2019t like in the story:The reader will be introduced to the territory wars between the Townies and the Cadets, through the story telling of Taylor Markham. That is where most of the story will revolve. I don\u2019t appreciate that part of the story; it\u2019s like a stupid scheme to be implemented in a boarding school. I know it\u2019s hard for me to relate on that side of the story since I didn\u2019t get to live in a boarding school, but I\u2019ve heard enough of the territory wars, even the small scale one. It may be a good component to a new storyline, but to be reading numerous chapters just to discuss about territory wars, which doesn\u2019t have any strategic ideas against the other troop, only a story of falling in love with the enemy is tiring. It\u2019s like I want to pull the hairs of the girls and pinch the boys on their sides to tell them to be serious on their business, and studies.Taylor will eventually search for her guardian, Hannah, which somehow confused me. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind the existence of Hannah, so what\u2019s with the sudden eagerness to find her? I think Taylor\u2019s character is too dysfunctional that her emotional attachment to Hannah is as confusing as her character. It can be said that she\u2019s trying to keep herself detached from anyone, but I hope she showed a little heart since she\u2019s speaking in the story. It could be a positive side to the story telling, but I find it annoying. I know it\u2019s only me.A boy in the tree, the Hermit, the Brigadier, Hannah, Jonah Griggs, the serial killer, Santangelo, the Prayer Tree, the Club house, the territory wars. They are all put together to create twist and confusion to the story, which eventually will be put in order as the story unfolds. Sounds exciting, it sounds thrilling, a page-turner one can say, but I say annoying, and trying-hard. I think the author tried too hard to put confusing aspects of the story to put suspense and mystery. It\u2019s a good factor in the story telling, but I think it wasn\u2019t written at the right place and time. I don\u2019t know, I may be wrong, but that is what I feel. Throw stones on me now.Taylor\u2019s coldness and stiffness annoyed me more. Her character is too cold, inside and out, that it\u2019s kind of hard to understand her interest on other people\u2019s business. Her concern on Hannah looks fake, and her falling in love with the enemy is stupid. She is also so eager to find her real parents, but her emotion was too shallow to understand her purpose.See, it\u2019s hard for me to appreciate stories written about teenagers. I know I\u2019m talking like I wasn\u2019t a teenager once, but I am confident to say I wasn\u2019t as annoying and stupid as these characters.What I like about the story:If I don\u2019t like Taylor, then what three stars are for? It\u2019s for the story of friendship and value of family that the story tackled.Italicized portion of the book will introduce the reader to another story. One may find it confusing, but only if you would not pay much attention to the early part of the story. Honestly, I like the italicized part better than the story of Taylor and her dysfunctional leadership in the territory wars.The italicized part is not just any story of a manuscript but a story taking account of one of the character\u2019s story. I must say that part is well written and thank goodness to this part, the rest of Taylor\u2019s silly storytelling was put in order. This part talks about the friendship of 5 friends from the boarding school, who originally started the territory wars. So, yes, it explains the silly territory wars the group of Taylor is engage into. The five friends were united by the accident in Jellicoe Road, and a friendship tight enough to keep them together started. The 5 friends experienced different issues in their younger years, but they remained supportive of each other. They grew up, lived a life away from each other but their lives are still tangled altogether. Their friendship keeps them connected at one point to another. And that is what I appreciate in this story. I remember my friends, and the unwritten rule of loyalty we once made. I remember the faces of my good friends who\u2019ve been my confidantes since grade school, my close friends from the teenage years, and those I met in the University. This part of the book is close to my heart. It\u2019s a rare gem to find friends who will stay with you up to the end. The friends who will remain by your side to lift you up when you\u2019re down. And the italicized part didn\u2019t fail to convey that heartwarming message of friendship and importance of family.I feel the need to acknowledged Manchetta\u2019s effort to intertwine the story of 5 friends to Taylor\u2019s own story. There are twist and turns, suspense and intrigued, and practically the end eventually justified the means. Though I still can\u2019t help but hope that Taylor\u2019s character was given more depth, and I know there\u2019s a better way to tell us the connection of the 5 friends and Taylor\u2019s life.

I went from \"this is weird\" to \"what the heck is happening\" to \"THIS IS AMAZING!\". There was this beautiful story of connection, forgiveness, love, and friendship wrapped up in a mystery. Taylor had been abandoned on Jellicoe Road at age eleven, and more or less, cared for by Hannah, whose disappearance set the whole story in motion. In her search, Taylor found Hannah's manuscript, and though it seemed random at the time, she was soon able to draw parallels between the fictional lives of the characters and her own.At the same time, Taylor was leading her team in the annual boundary battle between her school, the townies, and the cadets. Alliances formed, and grew into something quite wonderful. These unlikely friendships brought me so much happiness, and it meant a lot to me, that Taylor found her people.As Taylor found more and more clues in her search for Hannah, I watched all the pieces fall into place, and then, all the feels were unleashed on me. Once it started, I couldn't stop the avalanche of emotions that began filling me up. There were lots of tears as it all became clearer, but there was a lot of joy in there too.I had to be patient, and let Marchetta lay the foundation for this wonderful tale.

Now about the book and how I felt while and after reading. I was looking forward to read this book for ages. I had read so many 5-star reviews to this book that it never occured to me that I could be not charmed by it. The weird thing is, I tried to love it. I honestly did my best to find a way into the story and warm up for the characters and learn to love and suffer with them. Unfortunately, I didn't find my way into the story. The first 100 pages or so were meant to be confusing, well, to me they weren't. I sensed such a connection after, like 50 pages, and when everything came clear I just inwardly nodded and shrugged, because it was a bit obvious to me, really. Why else would an author connect two stories like that? And why else make them so \"tragic\"? The two main story-lines seemed a bit weak to me, by the way. I was highly annoyed with the war games. They seemed pathetic and useless to me, because well, they really had no use except for bringing Taylor and Griggs together. I actually wondered how people come up with such stupid games and ideas, while reading, I wondered whether there are people in the real world who act the way the characters acted. If such people exist I am persuaded that I should avoid these people, for otherwise the urge to strangle somebody may turn out to be stronger than my self-control. Taylor was pathetic. To me she was just pathetic and that's absolutely it. One second she was all analytic and serious and icy and the next she turned into an 'emotional' mess who hid somewhere in the corner. She was chewing on her 'problems' the whole bloody time instead of doing something, or accepting the past and getting over it and just living. It felt like Taylor was walking circles over and over again and I just wanted to slap her, hard, and walk away. What use is there from moping over your \"terrible-terrible\" life in your room? There is the world, there are responsibilities, things that have to be done.Her relationship with Griggs wasn't any better. It was \nbeyond weird\n and completely unrealistic to me. No real romance, and definitely no chemistry at all. Hannah could have acted in a more grown-up manner too, but well, I didn't judge her. As for the other characters... Well, they weren't anything special, expect maybe the one who was always mentioned and remembered, but never appeared. I couldn't make out a real plot in this book. Just a story moving really really really slow. I wasn't exactly bored, but I was \nimpatient\n and just wanted it to end as soon as possible after about 70% of the book. Exasperated. That's the word for how I felt. To the majority of the people the write style of this author seems magical, amazing...whatever. To me it is forced, difficult to swallow and weird. It doesn't get me, I cannot get into a story with such a write style, it is like a dead text to me. The whole story with all its characters and places and descriptions and plot twists felt unrealistic, forced and \n'un-alive'\n. As if the author tried hard to be unique and impressive and failed. I'm sorry, really, but the whole time while reading I felt either like shrugging or rolling my eyes.

Little accidental foray into the YA world for me, and my feelings are mixed.I see why it can feel satisfying to gradually piece together a story from a set of ambiguous puzzle pieces; for me, though, it's a style that often makes me feel alienated. I usually like to be grabbed immediately and to feel like I'm living inside the book, not to find myself scratching my head and saying, \"What's happening here?\" And because I'm like that I often end up detaching from books like these and failing to figure things out, as much out of emotional distance as out of the book's actual ambiguity. Occasionally, though, the style works for me and I feel really brilliant for having solved the puzzle and satisfied that I stuck with the book. This particular experience fell right in the middle of those two poles. What appears to be the main plotline of the book is pretty unclear at first, and is interspersed with insets from an even murkier subplot where you really have no idea who's talking or what's happening. Of course, the two stories are connected and the hows and whys of that gradually unfold -- a little too gradually for my taste. To the book's credit, though, I did stick with it and was rewarded -- mostly -- by increasing clarity after the halfway point or so. I might reread it and appreciate it more the second time around, if I cared enough to do so.I will say that the plot, once it finally unfolded, was pretty brilliant. Some of the characters and their dilemmas were interesting, although I never really felt like I knew any of them well.

To top off her worries, there is a territory war going on between the Townies (kids populating Jellicoe Road) and the Cadets, who visit for 6 weeks each year for training. In the search for answers, Taylor not only uncovers mysteries regarding her mother and Hannah, but begins to mature and develop her identity.Meanwhile, a story from the past of 5 friends, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Narnie and Tate, is being told. At first, these storylines seem completely irrelevant and unrelatable, but as the story develops, the past and present collide.Placed in the middle of a muddled town, Melina Marchetta left me completely baffled. However, in the midst of confusion and tragedy, the story continues to surge forward, and as questions were answered, I found myself lost in the captivating worlds of Jellicoe Road. Taylor\u2019s coming of age is evident, especially after a beautiful, bittersweet ending. On the Jellicoe Road ends with life, identity, and characters, laughter, death and a road that will be remembered.This book is highly recommended for all.

I also feel so in awe of the complex plotting that Melina Marchetta did. On the other hand, the format/structure felt clunky and I couldn't really get into the story until about halfway in when I felt like I finally got at least a grip on how the dual narratives might connect. The idea of the territory wars then felt quite abandoned halfway through too, when I don't even know how I felt about this elaborate territory war game thing yet. But the twists were twisty surprising and the characters were quite diversely unique. I love the characters Raffy and Chaz, and Taylor was interesting. In the end I think the biggest thing that bugged me was how melodramatic the book was... It got too sad, like for the sake of inserting some drama into the story. Taylor cried so much, had panic attacks so much, and I couldn't balance her magical dreams with the forcefully realistic sadness. Great to see Melina Marchetta get ambitious and develop her writing, but for the book among all she has written that gets the most raved reviews, I definitely prefer her others.

I am a mess! I finished this book last night and I WEPT through the last few chapters! My heart has been ripped out of my chest. My God, this book! This book is BREATHTAKING! This book is a triumph! It is that truly rare gem that you know will forever redefine excellence in your mind, and every other \u201cgreat\u201d book will now be compared to, and you already know will likely pale in comparison to. This book is the BEST YA novel I have ever read. This book may be one of the best books I have EVER read in my LIFE!Honestly, I don\u2019t have the words to describe the astonishing beauty that is this story and this prose. What a privilege it was to have this reading experience! What a privilege it was to know these characters! What a privilege it was to be captivated by this gorgeous prose! A friend of mine who\u2019s an avid reader had been recommending this book to me for years! I wish I had listened to her much earlier! This book should have been my absolute priority! When I finally started reading it, I was very confused! I spent the first 25% of the book not knowing what is going on. In fact, I read the first 25% twice, in hopes of finding some important info I had missed the first time. Then I got very nervous that I\u2019m not going to like the book because it doesn\u2019t make sense and I\u2019m going to disappoint my friend by going back and saying I have no idea what she liked about this book! O, Ye of Little Faith! I needn\u2019t have worried one bit! Every single sentence here has a purpose. Every single piece of the puzzle will masterfully fall into place. It all comes together BEAUTIFULLY! I don\u2019t really want to talk about the plot. In my opinion, it\u2019s best to go into this book knowing as little as possible about it. And if you really need to know what the story is about, it\u2019s been discussed in great detail by so many other reviewers. I\u2019d rather talk about how it made me FEEL all the feelings. Suffice to say that the book explores some heavy themes, but at its heart, it is a coming of age story; a story about finding who you are and where you belong, and where you long to be. it\u2019s a story about devastating heartbreak, loneliness, immense loss, but also resilience, the absolute healing power of friendships, the beauty of first love, and the places and people who make us feel like we are home.This book has a complex plot, one that is structured intricately. There are dual narratives and a large cast of characters. You could say there\u2019s a lot going on, and the book is under 300 pages! But what you have to understand is that this is not your average run of the mill YA. You\u2019re in the hands of a true genius! This is a rich and complicated tale. And it\u2019s very sophisticated, both in the themes it explores, and in the art of storytelling. The author seamlessly moves between the dual narratives, and slowly, slowly, unravels the mystery elements and unspools the thread that will connect all the pieces.By the end, you\u2019ll sit there, absolutely stunned. Not just by how the dual narratives come together perfectly and harmoniously, but by the small details, the subtle connections that truly take your breath away. You\u2019ll come to find that nothing was wasted here. That every little comment, every tidbit of info, and every thought was there for a reason, and they all create such a tsunami of emotions within you! The prose is truly hauntingly beautiful. Melina Marchetta is an astonishing wordsmith! Few can do what she has done here! Very few!It is extraordinary how the author manages such a large cast of characters so masterfully. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, and I couldn\u2019t help but to care about each and every one of them. God, I don\u2019t remember having read many books where I fell so deeply in love with so many of the characters, even the minor ones. And the punchy dialogues! They were so real. I giggled reading some of them. But then again, I also cried many times, reading Taylor\u2019s narration of her story. What an emotional rollercoaster this was!This book did something to me. It sliced through my heart, cut a piece of it, and stole it forever! This is a book I will never forget! One I suspect I will come back to again in the future. This book deserves to be read by all, and not just young adults. Not the likes of Twilight, which for some incomprehensible reason steals the spotlight. This is the caliber YA literature should be.I kneel before you  Melina Marchetta. You\u2019ve bewitched me. You\u2019ve somehow bottled up magic and served it up in this 300-page package.

Melina Marchetta\u2019s The Jellicoe Road was the first contemporary Young Adult novel I\u2019ve read, and to be honest, I was not sure what to expect. The story started with a shock, the car accident involving the Schroeders and the Markhams, and I asked myself, will this be one of those sad and tragic stories? Then it was revealed that it was part of a manuscript that the narrator, Taylor Markham, was reading. The setting of Taylor\u2019s world was quite unfamiliar: the school system in Australia, the Houses, the Townies and Cadets, some of the terminologies that were used, all of these for me needed a little of getting used to. I\u2019ve already gone by the first 5 chapters yet I was still not sure how I can get into the story. I felt like an outsider looking in while reading Taylor\u2019s narration and I was not sure if I really care what these kids were going through with their school struggles and seemingly pointless territory wars. My interest was more attuned to the manuscript: the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude felt like it has a lot more grounding since I was a witness to the friendship they forged amidst a horrific tragedy. Then I was in the part in Taylor\u2019s timeline where Hannah left suddenly and Taylor could no longer contain herself and she just needed to confront the principal about it. She revealed that she hated the thought of appearing weak in the eyes of the other students even though deep inside, she felt weak without Hannah. It felt like I understood Taylor a little bit for the first time, for who hasn\u2019t even once in their lives hid what they were really feeling inside, pretending as if everything was ok.I thought there was an inverted contrast between the struggles of the Fab 5 in the manuscript and Taylor: For Taylor, who was having trouble trusting anyone because of her past, her life-question was: how can I trust anyone ever again? Those who were involved in the accident needed each other to survive. For Narnie and the rest, their life-question was: How can we live if we didn\u2019t trust each other to hold us up? Thematically, I thought this was where both worlds would converge, that through friendship, they would find their own self-worth. But not everything\u2019s as neat and ideal as I expected. The novel was dedicated to unfold tragedy after tragedy, and everything began to unravel because of the disappearance (and death) of Webb. Webb was the lynchpin of the Fab-5\u2019s friendship, he was the one holding everyone up, the one who\u2019s passion for life inspired them to continue living. Without him, the consequences were disastrous: Tate left suddenly, Fitz became crazy, Narnie and Judd both harbor guilty feelings about what happened.There was this scene where Narnie and Judd was talking in the river. Narnie said that if Webb disappeared, there will be no one left for her, and she felt she might disappear, and Judd was the only one who was making her feel that her existence has substance and reality. That was a beautiful portrayal about how friendship matters to some people: the presence of others, especially their connection to us, helps ground our existence, the glance of the friend confirms that we are alive, that we are somebody worth it worth it worth it!At first I was disappointed with how the story was progressing in the case of the 5 friends. I thought that in spite of their friendship, they were unable to see their own self-worth, that the friendship didn't give them the strength to survive and flourish. Especially Tate, I thought, how could she leave so suddenly, and how does that honor Webb\u2019s death? Upon further reflection, that was what I wanted to see, but what was the novel actually trying to show? Instead of in spite of, I realized they were able to form friendships that could last a lifetime despite what they've been through. How much could we say about our own lives?It was obvious that there was a connection between the 5 and Taylor\u2019s world. When all of these connections were slowly revealed, Taylor\u2019s issue on trust was being put to the test. Jonah Griggs was her main gateway to recover that capacity to trust again, Raffy and Chaz were the supporting pillars of that gate. Truth be told, I was imagining what my impression is if I met Taylor in person. Without knowing her history, I probably wouldn\u2019t like her because of her moods and attempts to push people away and piss them of in the process. This novel reminded me to always look at a person without judging eyes for we never know what his or her story is. I find the author\u2019s writing style fascinating and frustrating at the same time, it was descriptively sparse and half-the-time muted, it is as if the reader was watching a scene outside a window draped with translucent curtains, never revealing the whole scenery, bending the light and obstructing small portions of the unfolding story. There were some things that the book was silent about that I would have loved to know: how did Taylor react when she was found out that Fitz was the one who killed her father? How did Tate react when she found out about this, or did she ever know? What was going on inside Narnie the whole time that she lost her brother, how did she manage to be strong all of a sudden?Another thing that I liked about the novel was the dream scenes that Taylor included in her narration. I thought dreaming in the novel was how the author showed that people we love who have already passed-on never really left us. A touching moment was when Fitz was finally reconciled with Webb through Taylor and her dream. It is as if to say, some friendships do endure even beyond this world. Even with all the tragedies and the traumas the characters endured throughout the novel, most especially Tate and her daughter, this is one of those books that ended so gracefully and satisfyingly. Taylor, who had trust issues from the start, dropped her insecurities and found the grace of forgiving her mom. Through the inevitable darkness of death, both daughter and mom found intimacy and freedom. Narnie, who had lost her ability to wonder after the car accident, through the healing of belongingness and friendship, finally regained that which speaks volumes: peace within herself and hope for the ever surprising renewal and enchanting journey towards tomorrow.Here are some of the lines in the novel that I really love:\u201cSee, I remember love. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t understand. And what I also remember is that in telling that tale to the Cadet on the train I got a glimpse of peace.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cThese people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well they can tell what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cWebb was grinning. Tate, too. They always grinned in unison.

He\u2019d never done anything good and nobody had ever said anything positive to him. But that night, on the Jellicoe Road, it was like he was reborn. The lives he saved gave him purpose and he loved those kids more than anything.\u201d Taylor telling the story of Fitz\u201cI remember love. It\u2019s what I have to keep on reminding myself. It\u2019s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that\u2019s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It\u2019s not the pain they\u2019re getting over, it\u2019s the love.\u201d \u2013 Taylor\u201cThen we spoke about our dreams and how we always felt safe in them, no matter how bad everything else seemed.\u201d \u2013 Taylor talking about the Hermit\u201cI want to yell out to everyone, \u201cIt\u2019s a game, these territory wars.

Not issues like who she's going to go to the dance with, nor like contemplating the next move in the chess game she's about to win, by the way. These are deep-seated issues, like looking for a mother in the drugged figure who changes her name every time they move, or facing a terrible lonesomeness amongst people she doesn't quite know to be a friend or a foe.This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like, to quote a song title, a beautiful disaster. I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow. Very raw, very deep. It cuts into the very soul; it's about that hidden side of us we don't want the world to see (and which it turns its back upon - ironically, sometimes just when we need it the most). This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side. Really, it's quite the emotional roller coaster - it will make you cry, laugh, cuss and dream, all in the same page.Essentially, this isn't a book that invites you to keep those rose-colored glasses on. This is a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. { Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like a very personal journal of a girl, trying in vain to keep herself sane. There is here some talk of the most sensitive subjects: teenage pregnancy, drugs, poverty, prostitution, murder, depression. These are, however, merely mentioned in course as seemingly everyday objects - which, in truth, they are. { This may also serve as a reminder that it never hurts to look twice at the dark alley or the sleeping figure on the train; they may very well be linked to us in a way we may never know. }However, as bleak as the world seems, Marchetta does offer us something to hold on to. It may be just a few words carved in the tallest tree, or a song quietly repeating in a dream, but there's always something good to look forward to behind the bad.There's always wonder.Other notes:I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow.

To see those little behaviors and feelings that used to be how I operated and felt suddenly made me understand that what I was going through, while I was in the same stage as Taylor (though, of course, not of her circumstances!), was not as unique as I thought.

Those who are regular readers of Persnickety Snark know that I am a HUGE Melina Marchetta fan because she's a talented writer, she has created many intensely personal and real characters and I think she's the bee's knees as a human being as well. This is biased. But then again the Printz award, and the plethora of other awards she's won for this title and the others, show that (perhaps) I have exceptional taste.Jellicoe is my beloved. I adore it. I have read it many times and recently listened to it as my first ever audiobook experience. I can't objectively review it anymore. So instead of writing a proper review, I am writing down the twelve reasons I love it.1. At first it has a more confusing structure than the Christopher Nolan movie, Momento. Relax and let all the carefully crafted threads start weaving into a tapestry of awesomeness. The results? A scene that will squish your heart into minced meat. It also makes Jellicoe Road a fantastic book to re-read multiple times as you always pick up something new.2. Shows that tween girls really are terrifying and that they can make teen boys quake in their boots.3. All of Marchetta's boys are crushable. But she has a way with kissing scenes...don't believe me, check this out - \"When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already.\" Melting yet?4. Jonah Griggs, the MOST compelling tortured love interest in YA. He's not supernatural, he's just supernaturally divine. He's an ass, a joker, a tough nut, a sensitive soul and a great snogger. He's also kitted out in fatigues most of the time. He's perfection in his detailed imperfection. Only he could swear at a girl and still make you swoon.5. The band. Don't want to ruin it but if you've read the book you know why. Comic relief in mullet form.6. The past - heart wrenchingly awful and beautiful in one clearly imagined intro. The rest is gravy.7. Hannah - the heart of the book and one half of the soul of the book. Her story and that of the one she loves, is just....ahhhhh.8. Territory wars. Forget Hogwarts and Voldermort, that's child's play. See what happens when boarders, townies and cadets battle over territory. Enormously fun, sometimes brutal and a great use of the Aussie bush.9. Santangelo and Raffy. He might be a bully and a cad and a hardheaded mule but his bickering with Raffy cracks me up. He's a good sort and she's a fabulously strong, maternal, uncompromising chick in a completely different way than Taylor.10. The way in which grief, desertion and family are all integrated so beautifully with love, friendship, war and identity. Big ideas but delicately crafted.11. The boy in the tree.12. Taylor Markham. She's more likely to punch you in the guts than give you the time of day. Hurt so many times, she no longer lets people in. She's a brick wall with a harsh edge, direct point of view and an amusing (and usually) blunt way of putting things.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, and when it started I suspected a hint of dystopia, with weird dream-like interludes (because, seriously, it\u2019s hard to find a YA book at the moment that\u2019s not dystopian!). Not so. I'll admit the first few chapters are confusing and you may be tempted to put the book down - DON\u2019T DO IT!!! It all becomes clear, and then you can sit back and enjoy the ride. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting (at 2am this morning in fact, which may explain why I'm having trouble stringing sentences together at the moment). The story is set around the life of Taylor Markham, the 17 year old newly elected \u2018leader\u2019 of a boarding school on Jellicoe Road. Taylor was abandoned by her mother when she was 11, and her only recollection of her father is riding on his shoulders. The only adult influence in her life is her mentor Hannah, who lives in an unfinished house by the river and who has suddenly vanished into thin air.To top all of Taylor\u2019s problems off, there is a territory war about to start between the boarders, the Townies (kids from the Jellicoe Town) and the Cadets (a group of boys who come for a 6 week training exercise every year to Jellicoe). The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother. The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again.Running parallel to Taylor's story is the story that Hannah has been writing, about five kids who grew up in the town 20 years ago. This story is shown in pieces throughout the novel. I loved the way the two stories (past and present) were interwoven. Even though you start to figure out how it all fits together as you read, it doesn't ruin the storyline at all, in fact I found that it enhanced the story as it all meshed together and I started to understand how everything related. I also loved the story of the territory war. Not only because it made for some good laughs but also how it starts as one thing and changes into something else as the story progresses and the characters come together. I don't know where to start with the characters, they were all so real, and each a product of what they had endured in the past. Of course the back stories are slowly revealed throughout the book so you don\u2019t know why they are the way that they are, sometimes until the very end. It was amazing to watch the characters change as their relationships developed and they came to terms with their past. I particularly loved the characters of Taylor, Griggs and the Brigadier - from the beginning you just know that each of them are much more than what they seem. The 5 kids from Hannha\u2019s story and the secondary characters Chaz, Raffy, and the rest of the kids from the boarding school, are well fleshed out and add to the story. I\u2019d recommend this book to everybody. Lots of laughs, and a few tears as well. A fantastic book by a great Australian author.

I've had years to marinate over the (nearly) unanimous love for this book. It has a tendency to raise expectations, you know. So maybe if I'd read it years back, I wouldn't have found it good, emotionally effective, but a bit disappointing.The first 100 or so pages were kind of a slog. I very nearly checked out more than once. I simply wasn't interested in the turf wars between Boarders, Townies, and Cadets. It all seemed so silly, so entirely overblown, that something that lasts only a few weeks would have such an incredibly high importance for everyone involved. It's not like these are rival schools, just across town, not entirely. The Cadets are only in town for about two months a year and surely have other things to do with their time. Rivalry made sense, but elaborate decade and a half wars with treaties and maps? Just kind of silly, and not terribly interesting. I only kept reading because I found myself becoming invested in Taylor despite myself. I got entirely caught up in her voice, in her emotions, and in wanting to see things turn out better for her. That, I think, is where this book really shines. And not just when it comes to Taylor herself. The teenage characters in this book all feel so real, and Marchetta put in serious effort in developing them to be so. And so I kept reading, to the point where the plot became bearable, just because I kind of loved these characters in a story that I didn't care about at all.I sometimes complain about a lack of actually present adult role models, and that's rarely more true than it is here. But I generally forgive the book for that, because that very absence is sort of a plot point, instead of a convenient device. Taylor's personality has been molded by her mother abandoning her at a young age, and by not having a true substitute parental figure in her life at all. Hannah is the closest thing she has to an adult who cares for her on a personal level, and she's always kept her at arm's length and vanishes at the beginning of the book. (view spoiler)[Seriously, Hannah, what the hell? I get that Taylor's mother specifically asked her not to be a mother to her, but there's no reason she couldn't have been an aunt. And there's also no reason for her to put the vague wishes of Taylor's absent, drug addicted mother over the very real needs of her young niece. I'm so sad for Taylor that the one person entrusted to care for her still wasn't able to put her first. (hide spoiler)] So yes, while it's a trope that I'm a little sick of, it was used very well here.I do wonder if reading this sooner might have made me feel a little more forgiving towards those first 100 pages.

Were the kids ever serious? What exactly are Cadets sand Townies? Are they like kids that are sent to a summer camp or something?  (hide spoiler)] I had a very hard time placing the scene in a certain time line. It seemed \"dystopian\" at first but it mentions Michael Jackson and Harry Potter which made me even more confused. But apparently the Townies, Cadets and the Houses were at \"war\". It just didn't seem like a child's game of tick tack toe. Aside from this major conflict there are questions to be asked about Taylor (the main character) and her past. And the story about Webb, Narine, Fitz, Tate (who I only realized later was used as a woman's name =P) and Jude. (who turned out to be used as a male's name) The story of these five people that didn't fit at all in between chapters.

But there were so many other mysteries to be solved and I wasn't going to stop until I found out every single one of them. And the author's way of slowly revealing them was genius.

But additionally it has made me sit in silent stupor on the sofa afterwards, because even the hopeful and positive ending could not erase the enormous sadness the story instilled in me. It is difficult to explain without giving to much away concerning the mystery of Taylor Markham's past which unravels piece by piece. Taylor is a state ward in an Australian boarding school. She was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at a Seven-Eleven and almost immediately found by a woman named Hannah when she was eleven years old. Before Jellicoe Boarding School Taylor lived with Hannah for a year, who is a counselor at Taylor's dormitory now. As newly elected head of her house Taylor is responsible for the well-being of her house-mates, but also for the traditional territorial wars with the so-called Townies and the Cadets, a bunch of boys from a military school camping in the woods. Taylor's past catches up with her, when she has to negotiate with moody cadet Jonah Griggs. Four years ago she got rather close to him him when she tried to run away to find her mother and he was trying to go back to his family. Taylor still blames him for getting caught, for betraying her. The situation gets even messier, when Hannah suddenly disappears without telling Taylor. Taylor begins to realise how much Hannah means to her and that there might be a connection between the story Hannah has been writing about five kids living on Jellicoe Road twenty years before, Hannah's distance and her own life. The narration alternates between the present told from Taylor's point of view and snippets from Hannah's manuscript.

The whole country is just one shiny Printz Award, at this point!But I wasn't sure about this book at first. I had trouble keeping the names straight and keeping track of whether they were a townie or a Cadet or from the school, and then the there's the politics within the school to keep track of as well. And the bits that are in italics were a bit off-putting at first, until I started piecing it all together. It's a wonderful mystery when it all starts to take shape, and very heart-breaking.

I live on the Jellicoe Road. There are the Townies who think they own the place, and the Cadets who come once a year. Then there\u2019s the Jellicoe School \u2013 a collection of abandoned and troubled teenagers who have all congregated at this bushland boarding academy.And every year, there\u2019s the territory war.For as long as anyone can remember the boarders, cadets and townies battle it out for territory around Jellicoe \u2013 from the prayer tree to the club house, bike tracks and river walks. Jellicoe is a puzzle, and whoever gathers the most pieces, wins. This year Taylor Markham has been voted leader of the school. Santangelo is the Townie boss, and Jonah Griggs the Cadet commander. Between the three of them they\u2019ll wage war \u2026 but when the battle gets underway, the fight takes a turn none of them saw coming.Taylor and Jonah have a history. They ran away together when they were fourteen years old. Taylor was running to her mother, the one who abandoned her on the Jellicoe road when she was eleven-years-old. And Jonah was just running.When the war gets underway Taylor\u2019s house mentor, her beloved Hannah, leaves unexpectedly with no word of when she\u2019ll return. Taylor travels down to Hannah\u2019s half-finished house everyday, searching for clues\u2026 like Hannah\u2019s manuscript. The novel-in-progress tells tale of five Jellicoe children; Narnie, Jude, Tate, Webb and Fitz. The plot is out of order and mired in tragedy, but the more Taylor reads the more she\u2019s convinced that there\u2019s truth to the story. And maybe, just maybe, Hannah\u2019s story will fill the gaps in Taylor\u2019s own memory.First published in 2006, \u2018On the Jellicoe Road\u2019 is Melina Marchetta\u2019s standing ovation. Winner of the 2009 Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature, \u2018Jellicoe\u2019 put Marchetta on the world stage and for many young readers it is the Marchetta book of their generation.\u2018On the Jellicoe Road\u2019 was a real departure for Ms Marchetta, and as a result the book seems to have a polarizing love/hate effect on audiences. Both \u2018Looking for Alibrandi\u2019 and \u2018Saving Francesca\u2019, Marchetta\u2019s first two novels, were told in linear. But \u2018Jellicoe\u2019 is not that easy. Narrated by Taylor Markham, readers are subjected to her fragmented mind \u2013 we are privy to the holes in her memory where something from her childhood is simply too awful to recount, but little pieces come floating out of the ether. Taylor\u2019s memory is jogged by the sudden disappearance of her beloved Hannah, the woman who found her abandoned on the Jellicoe road all those years ago \u2026 with Hannah\u2019s disappearance Taylor is forced to link the tragedies of the past with the events in her life today.Aided by Hannah\u2019s unfinished manuscript, Taylor delves into the tales of five Jellicoe teenagers; reading about their antics and friendship, the sadness that bought them all together and the tragedy that tore them apart. The tale of the Jellicoe five becomes the parallel story to Taylor\u2019s, told in fragments as Taylor reads various pages of the manuscript and pieces the plotline together\u2026This, I think, is the biggest hurdle for readers to overcome. The backwards and forwards momentum of the novel and the duel stories, coupled with Taylor\u2019s determined forgetfulness around the events of her childhood \u2026 it means that the novel comes to us in drips and drabs, the story leaking out like a dripping tap. But, therein lies the beauty of \u2018Jellicoe\u2019. This is a tough novel, to be sure, but it\u2019s also one of Marchetta\u2019s most rewarding and heart wrenching. \u2018On the Jellicoe Road\u2019 is a novel that stays with you long after you\u2019ve read the last line. Taylor Markham leaves an impression, and if you persevere with the novel (despite lingering doubts) you\u2019ll never regret having met her.\u2018On the Jellicoe Road\u2019 is especially beloved for having such a wonderful array of characters. From the Townies to Cadets, but especially the Jellicoe School, this is one novel that offers up a smorgasbord of secondary characters. There\u2019s Townie leader, Santangelo, flanked by his Mullet Brothers (also affectionately called Heckle and Jeckle). His father is the resident Jellicoe cop, and Santangelo has a dubious and complicated past with Raffaela (a townie girl who attends the Jellicoe School). Ben and Raffaela are Taylor\u2019s reluctant confidantes, the only two Jellicoe students who don\u2019t immediately doubt Taylor\u2019s capabilities as the new leader in their territory war. Then there\u2019s Jonah Griggs. Josie had bad-boy Jacob Coote, while Francesca pined for strong silent type, Will Trombal \u2026 but Jonah Griggs is in a league all his own amongst Marchetta\u2019s men. Taylor first met him at a train platform when they were both fourteen years old and running away, now they are each leading their own factions and fraternizing with the enemy is strictly forbidden. There are rumours about Jonah. Rumours about what he did to his father when he couldn\u2019t take one more beating. Rumours about what he does to those who trespass on Cadet territory. But the most persistent rumours concern him and Taylor \u2026 Jonah Griggs will break your heart, only to melt it again. I think he remains Marchetta\u2019s most complex male lead (though Finnikin and Tom Mackee are giving him a run for his money). Jonah is beautiful for his complexities and many shades of grey. He has a violent past that continues to impact him today, but with Taylor he seems to find an inner peace that is born of their intense love. Taylor and Jonah are definitely a stand-out couple, especially for their proof that you can heal after tragedy, but not by yourself. How does Jonah Griggs get to be a ten? He sits on a train with me when we\u2019re fourteen and he weeps, tearing at his hair, bashing his head with the palm of his hand, self-hatred pouring out of him like blood from a gut wound in a war movie, and for the first time in my whole life I have a purpose. I am the holder of the grief and pain and guilt and passion of Jonah Griggs and as we sit huddled on the floor of the carriage, he allows me to hold him, to say, \u2018Shhh, Jonah, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u2019 While his body still shakes from the convulsions, he takes hold of my hand and links my fingers with his and I feel someone else\u2019s pain for the first time that I can remember.As I said, \u2018On the Jellicoe Road\u2019 is not an easy tale. It\u2019s tough and bitter \u2013 Taylor\u2019s past will haunt and anger you, Jonah\u2019s confession will have you choking back tears and the unravelling tale of the Jellicoe Five will leave you a little bit heart-sick. But God, this book is beautiful. Marchetta took a chance and wrote a complex backwards-and-forwards novel, based largely around the memory gaps of one girl\u2019s delicate psyche. She writes about an ages-old territory war, which is intrinsically linked to a town\u2019s history that has seen an abundance of sorrow. This novel is filled with characters you\u2019ll never forget, and two stories that will imprint on your heart and have you re-reading again and again and again. Not an easy read, but then again the best one\u2019s never are. How to describe my adoration for this particular novel, when I love all of Melina Marchetta\u2019s work so very much? Well, it\u2019s probably best summarized by Taylor Markham herself;  I fall in love with these kids over and over again and my heart aches for their tragedies and marvels at their friendship.

I\u2019ve been hearing about this book FOREVER, it seems. Since I\u2019ve read Finnikin of the Rock and loved it, I knew Melina Marchetta\u2019s writing was for me. So I figured this was book would be an excellent choice to start off 2016 right. But omg, I\u2019m caught between holy shit this book nothing is ever going to outshine it this year what a perfect choice and why the fuck did I wait so long to read this Holly you\u2019re such an idiot for putting it off after you got a copy? It did take me a long time to ease into the story. Things were so, so confusing in the beginning, and I had no idea what was happening. And it took a little bit of patience on my end, and more of an effort to keep myself into the story. But once everything started making more sense, and the story was easier to follow along with, I was so hooked on the main character\u2019s voice, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading.Taylor Markham is chosen as the Lachlan\u2019s house leader, reluctantly. She doesn\u2019t seem to care about the wars, or about anything, really. She\u2019s pretty much an orphan, bitter about the world and about her life. Feeling trapped by her past and all of the kids in her House leaning on her for comfort and safety. And when her friend, Hannah, disappears, those feelings of helplessness just increase tenfold. I\u2019ll be honest, Taylor isn\u2019t an easy character to like (and, well, neither is Jonah). She\u2019s cold, pushes people away who just want to make her feel loved and cared for, and she makes decisions without thinking of the consequences or of who\u2019s going to get hurt by it. But underneath that hardened, tough exterior is just a girl who doesn\u2019t know how to let the shadows of her past stop her from moving on. She doesn\u2019t know who she is, and throughout the book, she\u2019s learning right along with you. I loved her story; I loved her character.I loved her strength and her fierceness. I loved that she wanted to be a better person, and that she started trying. I loved that she didn\u2019t let anything stop her from going after the answers she so desperately wanted. And what she finds is, not only her past, but a future worth living for.And in that future lies people she never expected to be in it, least of all Jonah fucking Griggs. This guy. Whoa, boy. He\u2019s not a nice guy. In fact, he\u2019s kind of an asshole who does assholish things and who never apologizes for them. But his actions speak louder than his words, and so, even when he\u2019s being a dick, you can tell there\u2019s a heart underneath that roughness. He just doesn\u2019t really show it, not even to Taylor. But as you learn more about him, you find that perhaps he\u2019s just a kid who\u2019s just sad, who\u2019s hurt and embittered about the world. Perhaps he\u2019s just using that meanness to keep people away, because he doesn\u2019t want to get hurt further than he has been. Perhaps, he even deserves a bit of forgiveness for the way he speaks to others, and to Taylor. Though I feel like we could have gotten to know him better, that he could have been a bit more well-rounded as a character, I think I see the reason why he\u2019s not. Because this wasn\u2019t about him, it was never about him or what he could be to Taylor. The story was Taylor\u2019s story, but one that he wanted to be a part of. She didn\u2019t NEED him to be a better or stronger person, but she had his support and his fumbling attempts to give her the romance she deserves.Melina Marchetta has this subtle way of writing, where she doesn\u2019t outright tell you something, but uses her words in such a way that it has more impact. I don\u2019t even know if that made sense, but omg, just like. She\u2019s a phenomenal storyteller, and the way she unraveled the two colliding stories was utterly brilliant. I\u2019m not sure if I was supposed to be paying close attention to the connections, but I did. And because I did, nothing was a surprise to me. I was able to figure out (almost) everything that had happened in the past, and about how Taylor was connected to the accident that happened 22 years before. But you know what? Knowing didn\u2019t matter. I was still hit with the impact of everything. I was still caught up in the mystery that Taylor is trying to figure out. The question of \u201cwhere is Hannah\u201d led her on a quest that helped her move on from her past. And man, the manuscript, the story of the five kids whose lives were irrevocably changed on the Jellicoe Road that fateful day, dug deep into my heart. I was just as invested in the past as I was in Taylor\u2019s present. I was not expecting that, nor was I expecting the amount of tears I shed over a book that I never thought would be\u2026 inspiring.And I think that had to do with the friendships in this book, the connections between people who you would never expect to become family to one another. Through a tragedy, five lives are forever changed. And over the course of the story, you see how much strength and happiness and peace is gained through the connections the characters have with each other. And that happens with Taylor, also. Not only does she find a relationship with Jonah, one that gives her courage and support, but she finally starts to let other people in. Raffaela, Santangelo, Ben, Hannah. The former two, they become hands to hold as Taylor\u2019s life unravels and she loses sight of who she is. But don\u2019t think that means they\u2019re one-dimensional or anything. Maybe except for Ben, everyone else has their own stories and personalities too, and it makes the book even richer. I especially loved the scenes with Raffy, Santangelo, Jonah, and Taylor. They became their own gang, outside of the wars, and one that gave Taylor a new appreciation for life. Because they stuck by her through everything, even when she tried to push them away. And that kind of friendship, the unshakable kind, is beautiful to behold!This book was expectedly and unexpectedly brilliant. I don\u2019t know how to really express the ways in which this story meant the world to me, but I tried. I hope I did it justice. Jellicoe Road was so much more than what I had thought I would get out of this story when I started it. And I know, I know this book isn\u2019t going to be one that I\u2019ll forget anytime soon. Nor will its characters, who managed to break and heal me in the same moment. It was a stunning, honest, and deeply felt story that captured my heart completely.brb moving to Jellicoe Road.Rating: 5 Paw Prints!", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["made-me-cry", "amazingly-wonderful", "inspirational", "left-me-speechless", "i-ship-this-couple", "feels-feels-everywhere", "tortured-heroes", "bff-goodness", "get-rec-d", "all-time-favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1160598950", "review_id": "1160598950", "date": "Feb 21, 2017", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Bec (booktineus)", "user_url": "/user/show/4619726-bec-booktineus", "text": "This review first appeared on Readers in Wonderland INITIAL REACTION5 THINGS ABOUT ON THE JELLICOE ROAD\nMy first Melina Marchetta contemporary\nOkay first is a lie. Technically ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is my second Marchetta contemporary because I had to read LOOKING FOR ALIBRANDI in high school. Either way, I loved this as much as I loved FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK! I cannot wait to delve into more of Marchetta\u2019s contemporary fiction, or all the other books she\u2019s written really.\nDual storylines\nI loved the way this story was told. There are two dual storylines, one from the manuscript and Taylor\u2019s, which overlap a tonne more than I was expecting. So much is inter-related and every single aspect is interesting. I loved the territory wars (it made it so much more entertaining than your usual romance/ family based contemporary) and the depth of the relationships between all the characters.\nSuper Australian\nI\u2019ve never been to boarding school but I\u2019ve been to school my entire life here in Aus, and I can tell you the atmosphere of the Jellicoe school is 100% accurate. Yes, we do have school houses but they\u2019re not as cool as the Hogwarts houses. The lingo in this is also spot on and I really appreciated the use of an Australian narrator for the audiobook!\nTaylor\u2019s growth\nI\u2019m so proud of Taylor. From a girl who really didn\u2019t want any responsibility in the beginning, she grew so much and became a fantastic leader. I can\u2019t believe how much stuff she\u2019s been through in her past, how much many of the characters have been through in their past honestly. They\u2019re all so precious.\nSo many emotions\nI did not expect to be so ruined by this book but it really does destroy all your emotions multiple times. Even the most minor characters pull at your heart strings. It\u2019s so easy to become incredibly connected to every single character, you really feel for them when bad things happen, and when you learn about their past you just want to tuck them under a blanket and give them a massive hug. They\u2019re all so precious.\nIn Summary\nI\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve finally had the opportunity to read some Marchetta contemporaries. ON THE JELLICOE ROAD was fantastic, so full of feels and emotions, I loved everything about it. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of Marchetta\u2019s stuff.

When the YA theme came up, I was excited to see that my one of my favorite books last year, Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta, was included in the short list. Of course that got me campaigning for the book, because when you love a certain book, you just want a lot of people to read it and hope to be enthralled by it like you were.The book won by one vote, and I was happy because it gave me the perfect excuse to reread the book. This time around, though, I wanted to try another format, so I got myself an audiobook version of the book and settled in for the ride. :) My mind was ready, but I wasn't really sure if my heart was. Still, I wanted to know if I would love the book as much as I did the first time around, especially since I know what was going to happen.How did I describe this book last year? ...reading this book was like breaking my heart and then putting it back together again. I know that sounds terribly dramatic, but that was exactly what I felt back when I first read this and I was anticipating the same thing when I listened to it. Listening to the book was a different experience, mostly because it gave me a bit of room to \"read\" while doing something else. The audiobook became my companion for my night shift work, and I was transported to that little stretch of Jellicoe Road every time I turn my player on. I found that I was paying attention to the things more, and that I caught little quotes that I wasn't sure if I caught before (my print copy has lots of dog-ears -- I didn't exactly take note what I was dog-earing then). I found the parts I love were still well-loved, and found new things to love in the book as well.One might think that rereading this book known for its confusing start will lessen the thrill of the reading experience because you know what's going to happen already. I was ready to be a bit less enchanted with the twists, to be less heartbroken when the things happen as I was expecting them...but I wasn't. Okay, perhaps it's because I came into the book expecting to love it again, so it was harder for me to find fault. There's one chapter that still killed me, over and over again, and there were those chapters that made me smile and stop and want to listen to them again, because I forgot about them already. Despite knowing what the story was about, the reading experience was still as enjoyable as the first.Admittedly, there was a time when I was asked, \"What's the point of all of this again?\" But then as I finished listening to the book, I realized that maybe it doesn't really have to have a point. It's a story of real life -- of Taylor and Jonah and Raffy and Santangelo, of Narnie and Jude and Webb and Tate and Fitz -- and it doesn't really have to make a single and simple point. Like what C.S. Lewis said in Mere Christianity, real things aren't made to be simple. So maybe, a story about real life and all its complications isn't supposed to be simple, either.I can't relate to Taylor's family woes, but once again, I'm amazed at how the friendships were forged in this book. This is the kind of friendship that makes you want to keep on fighting, to keep on going back, to keep on trying. If you ever have the chance to run into this kind of friendship, do everything in your power to keep it -- these are the kind of friendships that can save your life.So did I like it as much as I did the first time? There is no other answer to that question but yes. Maybe I will grow out of this in a few years, maybe not. But for now, I still stand by every word I wrote last year, and I am very happy to know of a place \"...where they would all belong, or long to be. A place on the Jellicoe Road.\" :)", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2012", "ya", "contemporary", "tfg-100", "audiobook"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1204945492", "review_id": "1204945492", "date": "Feb 18, 2015", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Eri", "user_url": "/user/show/5509001-eri", "text": "3/20/2015I was rereading this yesterday so I think it's finally time to write a review for it.I thought I had experienced the brilliance of Melina Marchetta's writing when I read Saving Francesca, a stellar novel that reduced me to an aching mess. That was nothing compared to the emotional wreckage that came with reading Jellicoe Road. It is a beautiful novel, well deserving of its high praise, and it is at once a heartbreaking tale but also one that will warm your heart, down to thedark depths of it. It's not the easiest book to get into, especially because the beginning is hard to understand, at least it was for me until the third attempt to start it. But it is well worth that initial struggle. This is the story of Taylor Lily Markham, a girl with no parents. A girl with a past that she doesn't even understand. The story of love, loss, family, and the beautiful power of relationships, all kinds. \nSee, I remember love.\n She is a part of a long tradition in her town, the border skirmishes that involve the three parties of the Townies, the Jellicoe School kids, who include herself, and the Cadets. The Cadets who include Jonah Griggs. It isn't a laughing matter, but a serious one that encompasses an old set of rulesand bloodshed. This year, now that Taylor is the leader, things are going to be different. But facing Jonah, who is the leader of the Cadets, is another story altogether. With a shared past, Jonah Briggs is the last person Taylor trusted, before things went horribly wrong. I don't want to give much away but there is a story behind every past, and theirs is the kind that elicits the urge to hug the characters. Or at least, in my case.Jonah Griggs, let's say he and I didn't get off on the right foot. I was unsure ofwhether I was going to love him or not, but I should have had faith. By the halfway point in the book I was utterly in love with this boy. This book isn't quite a romance but the part of the book that was, I wholeheartedly loved, especially the way it unfolded. Beside Taylor are lovable side characters, the other Jellicoe School kids, each with an endearing face that will make you long to be with them. It's impossible not to fall in love with them and the cherish the bond that holds the characters together. In particular, Raffy and Ben are the ones that feature the most and in whatever universe they truly exist, I wish them the best (view spoiler)[*cough* Raffy with Chaz and Ben with Justine is preferable (hide spoiler)].\n\"I believe in you, Taylor Markham.\"\nAnd there is the question of Taylor's past, how Hannah, the one adult that Taylor can trust, features in it and so much more. It is truly a journey to travel with her, through the heartbreaking joy and tragedy that follows her.A vital part of this story is about five characters whose intertwining lives are the heart of this story. To divulge anymore would be a crime, but all I can assure you of is that by the time all is revealed I was earnestly sobbing over them. Without them and the fateful incident on Jellicoe Road, this book would have been lost and I am eternally grateful that Melina Marchetta has the mind to write such a beautiful book. \n...who set out on their separate journeys that day not realizing the tragic ironies and joys of that collision of worlds on the Jellicoe Road.\nI don't often think this, but if any young adult book should be featured in english classes in high school, it would be this book. It is truly an honor to read this.Read this review hereFirst Read: 2/18/2015I'm currently silently crying because of this book. Some books leave a mark on your heart that will never fade, and I can say with surety that Jellicoe Road is such a book.

Can't re-call if this is my 4th or 5th time reading On the Jellicoe Road, but it is still just as beautiful and moving and leaves me tearing up on the couch, feeling so emotional!I'm pretty sure I will never stop loving this book. It is just the most gorgeous writing and story! Melina Marchetta knows how to crack your heart open and writes the most moving characters!On the Jellicoe Road is a bit of an older YA book now, published in 2006, and is set in rural Australia. It definitely has one of the more bizarre-sounding plots, and I will admit to being a little bit confused the first time I read it because there's a lot of characters and I didn't realize at first that the story was switching between two different points of view, so I'll warn readers about that up front. The main story is told by Taylor Markham, but everything that's italicized is a different point of view.The novel is set at a boarding school called Jellicoe, which is located about 7 hours drive from Sydney, right next to Jellicoe Town. Every year from September to November, a group of cadets come to Jellicoe to practice their outdoor skills and set up camp in the woods for 6 weeks. There are three main factions: the kids boarding at the Jellicoe school, the Cadets, and the Townies, who live and go to school in Jellicoe Town. During the 6 weeks that the Cadets visit every year, the Townies, Cadets, and Jellicoe School have a secret war going on behind the teacher's backs and duke it out to win territory from each other. This year Taylor has been selected as the leader of the Jellicoe School. Taylor has an unfortunate history and was abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road when she was just 11 years old. She was picked up by Hannah, who lives in a small house next to the school and spends the next 5 years attending the school. Taylor knows very little about her past and struggles with the pain she feels about being abandoned by her mother and hesitates to let anyone into her life. She is tested when at the beginning of term, Hannah, the only person who's ever been there for her, disappears. Taylor wants more from the people in her life, but she's afraid to love or let anyone in lest they abandon her too.The only thing Hannah leaves behind for Taylor is an unfinished manuscript about 5 kids and a tragic accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road 22 years earlier. Taylor is confused by the story, but starts developing an attachment to Hannah's characters, wondering if they might have more to do with her past than she realizes. Every single thing about this story is beautiful. The best thing I've always loved about Marchetta's writing is the bonds and relationships she creates between her characters. Marchetta really understands friendships and our need as humans to belong to something. Taylor is slowly falling apart in this novel and I love watching the relationships she builds with the other kids in the story and how they become friends and support each other. I love how each character has this incredible backstory that brings so much depth to the novel. I love that even Marchetta's minor characters are fully realized individuals and that every character matters. There are never throw away characters in Melina's novels.This is ultimately a story about growing up and self discovery. As someone who has been shuffled around, Taylor craves history and I love the history Marchetta creates between each of the characters. Many of them are very broken people and I love watching them grow throughout the novel. Plus, the writing is so dreamy. I think the manuscript is really well written, but I also love Taylor's inner monologue. There are so many great quotes in this book and it hits me right in the feels every time I read it. You do not have to be a teenager to enjoy this book. It actually has some pretty dark and mature themes and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!

It\u2019s impossible to write a review for this book without wanting to cry. No, I didn\u2019t in fact cry after reading this book because it didn\u2019t have a sad ending; however it was a sad book. When I say sad book I am talking about the fact that there is so much going on in this book, so many characters who lose hope and need to find it again, so many reasons to not go on in the lives of the characters. If that doesn\u2019t make you feel depressed I don\u2019t know what will. Do you ever have those days where you just want to drop down and not care about anything? Where you don\u2019t know what the purpose of your life is and you feel so miserable you have no idea what to do? Imagine having to read about characters going through that, if you can relate to it, it\u2019s somehow worse because when we read a book we want AWAY from reality, we don\u2019t want to have to face the reality of our own situation.In the end though, I believe this book is about never giving up that little bit of hope you will always have stored inside you because once you lose it, you are done for.The stories of each individual character is so amazing, there are no flat characters here. It\u2019s so hard to find a book where each and every character has some sort of meaning to them or are connected to the overall plot somehow instead of tid bids here and there. Marchetta though, fits everything together perfectly, like a puzzle; you wouldn\u2019t even know you were reading something that could be of some importance until you read it. Then you would just be surprised because you\u2019d see what a genius Melina Marchetta was.I was a bit vary going into this book, I mean I\u2019d read Finnikin of the Rock and it didn\u2019t necessarily live up to the hype. Plus this book was a sad one. I don\u2019t usually do sad books because hold this kind of power over me that multiplies all the emotions in the book, so if the book is sad, I am going to be depressed, but after reading this, I gave that rule up. I mean I haven\u2019t gone on a \u201cread depressing books\u201d spree but I don\u2019t avoid them anymore.Although the thing about this book is, I would read it again a hundred times despite how sad it made me because it was also one of the best things that ever happened to me. You see seeing I am not the biggest fan of contemporary/realistic to love a book of that genre this much is pretty amazing, but the thing about this one is that it also has that magical aura to it. Like a dream. It\u2019s so beautiful yet heartbreaking. I think I should probably kill myself for not reading it earlier. It\u2019s not a book for everyone, but the ones lucky enough to love it, they will walk away with one of the most beautiful experiences.Right After Reading the BookHoly. Freaking. Crap.My feels. OH MY FEELS!People are always going on about how great Melina Marchetta is. I read Finnikin of the Rock and I liked it.But this book takes her writing to a whole new level.There is so much pain and love in this book. It makes you want to crawl into a corner and cry your heart out.It hurt so much when you realized that (view spoiler)[ Webb is dead, I always liked him from how Taylor described him and how he was in his own story. But I always suspected it would be him.

I was stubborn and resisted, because most of Aussie writers' books I've read haven't suited me that much. The books I've read all have this distinct style of writing where words and scenes are cropped and rushed. While Marchetta does have that in her prose, it's very minimal and I never really turn much attention to it, because her books do what very few books are able to: these books suck you in and consume my mind, heart and soul.

Magical.Original ReviewOk. Ms Marchetta has totally broken me with this book. There is a reason why this woman is my fave author of all time. Every book she writes just pierces my heart and takes me weeks to recover from emotionally and this book is no different. I went to hear her speak recently and I brought in my entire stash of books to get signed and I am so delighted that I got her to sign this book for me.... With all honesty though, for the first 150 pages of this I was convinced this was a 2 star read and I felt gutted that I had finally read a book by her that I didn't love. I had NO idea what was going on and it is the biggest criticism of this book when you read the reviews (with lots of DNFs attached to it). The story switches between two time periods and for the first third of the book you have no idea who is who and what the three groups (cadets/townies/Jellicoe School kids) are. Actually at the end of the book I am still confused about the five houses - was it a boarding school or an orphanage or something else? I do wish that the three groups were a bit more clearly explained and although part of me realistically wanted to give a lower rating for making me work so hard to get into this story - I just can't as I love this book. I hit page 178 where Jonah makes a reveal (view spoiler)[ \"I wasn't there that day to get on the three forty-seven to Yass,\" he says. \"I was there to throw myself in front of it\"  (hide spoiler)] and I just lost it. I totally adore Jonah (what a beautifully broken soul). I love Hannah. I love Jude (and boy does Jude and Hannah remind me of Captain and Beatrice from Finnikin). I love how about half way through the book the two time periods come together and the \"war\" takes on a whole new meaning.I also love when a book with a mystery makes me fall for the red herrings (clever!). I was so convinced that (view spoiler)[ Taylor was the daughter of Hannah and Jude and that she had been kidnapped by Tate. Nope...  (hide spoiler)]. Although I did guess the other mystery surrounding Webb :-(. Oh that again broke my heart into a million pieces. The dialogue is perfect. This is one of the most beautiful books I have read - such friendship and such tragedy, such broken characters - but yet such a story of hope and optimism in the end. I am rattling on....that is the effect this book has had on me.....this is a definite re-read book and I think the second time around it will be even more amazing as that whole intro will come together in a totally different way.....Aussie Readers 2019 May Challenge: Mother's Day - A bunch of yellow daffodils (read a book where at least half the cover is yellow).

I LOVE that feeling. That feeling I get when I've read something SOOO consuming that I can't move on. I walk around for days in a daze recalling the story and just wanting to be back in that world. So, I knew I had to read Jellicoe Road. I put it on my wish list and then didn't read it until now because many people's reviews have described it as \"slow start\" or \"difficult to understand\" so I began to look at Jellicoe Road as something that would be a chore, but worth it.It wasn't a chore to read at all. I was hooked from the first few pages. The writing is haunting, emotional, and just simply beautiful.Jia also wrote: \"In fact, \u201cenjoyment\u201d seems like too mild a word. After its slow start, the book gathered more and more momentum, until I was completely swept away from thoughts of my own life. I became so invested in Taylor and the other characters in the book that some sections seemed heartbreaking to read, albeit in a cathartic and healing way. I laughed and cried \u2014 or, as my husband put it, \u201cblubbered.\u201d When I finished this book, my tear ducts felt completely empty.\"This is the story of Taylor Markham. A 17 yo student at the Jellicoe School. A private/state school in rural Australia. When she was 10, Taylor was abandoned at a 7 Eleven by her mother in a nearby town, and has lived at Jellicoe School ever since then. This is also the story of five kids that attended Jellicoe School (or 3 attended Jellicoe school, one was a cadet, and one a Townie) in the generation preceeding Taylor's. Their story is slowly revealed, as their relationship to Taylor is revealed. Jellicoe School students engage in territory warfare with the local kids and a troop of cadets that camp nearby for 8 weeks every year. At the beginning of the story, Taylor is instated as the leader of the Jellicoe kids so she must engage in negotiations and strategy at a time of great confusion for her as she slowly unravels the mysteries of the past. The woman at Jellicoe School whom she has become the closest to has disappeared with no word to her. Taylor is left feeling betrayed, confused and mentally unbalanced.This story is HEARTWRENCHING and absorbing. I loved it. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars (due to my complete love of the characters) is some frustration I have with almost every adult in this book.I don't like their secrets. They are unnecessary and cruel. I also don't like that they all supposedly love Taylor SO MUCH, yet Taylor has NO ONE for the majority of her life. I hate that with a white hot passion. So I docked a star, despite that I strongly suspect the Jellicoe Road will hold a special place in my heart for years to come.

I say no. \u201cIt\u2019s because they don\u2019t have coverage out here,\u201d Griggs tells him.\u201cNo,\u201d I say, looking up at Griggs. \u201cIt\u2019s actually because my heart belongs to someone else.\u201d And if I could bottle the look on his face, I\u2019d keep it by my bedside for the rest of my life.  I can\u2019t give away too many details, because when it comes to this book and these characters tiptoeing around the plot (and its sub-plot) is the best I can give you. What did Jellycole Road remind me of? Another YA. We were liars. Where the line between reality and dream was so thin, I couldn\u2019t discern what was happening and what was not.Dream. Such a weak and solitary word if we think about it. But for Taylor, the main character, a dream held so much power over her, she kept chasing it over and over again. A dream was the culprit of her parting ways with Jonah, years prior. A dream was where she had named herself.   \u201cGo to hell,\u201d he said, but there was a desolate fear in his eyes and I couldn\u2019t look away. \u201cBeen there. Trust me. It\u2019s so overrated.\u201d  I liked every single character. Every.single.one. Raffy with her sentimental, but firm attitude, Santangelo with his stoic voice, Ben the violinist turned advisor and Jonah.

Be a part of the territory wars? To be super close with Taylor and Raffy and the rest of them? Because this book is all those things, and so much more. There is incredible character development-Taylor's development. At the beginning, she's a devil-may-care, don't-give-a-shit-about-shit angry girl, whom, in different circumstances, I would've detested. On the contrary, I loved her from the get-go. She possesses spunk, brilliance, personality and charm. Later on, as the story progresses, we see the kindness in her, the love and respect she has for everyone and the faith, without losing her other admirable attributes. She is awesome, amazing; absolutely unforgettable. In fact, all the characters of this novel are unforgettable: Raffy, Ben, Jude, Hannah, Webb, Tate, Fitz, Chaz, Jessa, Chloe P., the Mullet brothers, Jonah, dear God, even Richard. They all have their distinctive, wonderful personalities. They all fit in the story without taking space. They are one of the best supporting characters I have ever had the fortune to read of. To meet. To remember. Moreover, the romantic parts of On the Jellicoe Road don't take over the whole story. The story's about Taylor finding herself, her past and present. Although the romantic bits are kept to a minimum, they're far better and far more swoon-worthy than a book that is all about romance. That Jonah Griggs, he makes my heart skip multiple beats, and I'm sure them aliens can hear the butterflies fluttering wildly in my tummy and my heart pounding when it isn't skipping multiple beats. Furthermore, it made me cry, this book. Because of the sadness of it all, the beauty of it all; the desire for it to not end, not just yet. A little bit longer, please, because I don't want to part with this book, this brilliance. The only disappointment I have is that I guessed everything a few chapters into the story. But that's probably due to watching a lot of crime shows. Or maybe I'm a crazy genius. I think it's the latter. This is my first Melina Marchetta book, but it most certainly won't be the last.

(along with picture quotes that I made).This is a book that's been sitting on my shelf for almost three years. Not kidding. I bought it awhile ago, not having a clue who this author was, or even knowing anything about the story, and thought I'd give it a try. I made it maybe a few chapters and felt completely lost and gave up. Who is this lady? And who told her she could write? I thought it was totally confusing and I should not waste another minute attempting to decipher it. Back on the shelf it went.Fast forward a year and I decide to give this author another try with Saving Francesca and then with The Piper's Son. Woah. Now I was completely aware of who she was, and immensely blown away by her writing. Everyone kept telling me I needed to read Jellicoe Road, that it's amazing. But I was also warned it's a book that takes awhile to push through. You have to give it time to marinate into your bones, simmer awhile inside your soul, but keep pushing through. I kept adding this book to my bookish resolutions, TWICE, to read it that year. But this fear kept creeping inside me, pushing it further back on the shelf.Well, folks. It's finally happened. I feel like I've just conquered a huge reading milestone in my life.I've read Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta.And what a beautiful, majestic, breathtakingly heart ache of a story it is.So what's the story about, you may be asking. I know I questioned this myself before I read the book, and never got a true answer. Something about a group of kids, on the Jellicoe Road, a tree, and a Jonah Griggs. But WHAT IS IT ABOUT?? I honestly don't think I can give the answers to that either. It's a book you have to experience for yourself, and quite possibly go into it blindfolded. Just know that it's a story so rich and pure with a plot that twists and turns, cultivating into the most beautiful ending your literary heart may ever experience.Shut out your fears, jump off that fence, and read this book right now. There is never going to be the \"right time\". NOW is the right time. Trust me when I say this, you're missing out on something extraordinary without knowing the beauty of this story. Melina Marchetta already chiseled out a place inside my heart with the previous two novels I read by her, but now she's solidified a spot in my top honors of writers who can never be topped, no matter what.I am so happy to have finally found my place among these Jellicoe Fans.

I have titled her as the Queen of Feels and Destruction. I know my rating for this book suggests otherwise, I did enjoy this book. It was my least favorite out of all the books I have read by her, though. Let me explain.First of all, I did not understand Taylor Markham. Reading her narrations felt like I needed her to explain more about how she felt towards her problems. There was a lack of a voice in her. With Marchetta's other female characters, I understood their frustration or their anger towards something, but with Taylor I felt like she was a brick wall. I didn't like her at times because she acted like such a stone cold bitch with her friends and Jonah. I just could not relate to her. And a lack of personality in her also did not help. I also did not enjoy the interweaving plots with Taylor's story and Hannah's. Not only was I utterly confused (because I am a very slow human being), I was just aggravated at the times where I needed to read Hannah's manuscript about the five kids on the Jellicoe Road. I skipped those parts, to be honest. I was just not interested, and that may have completely destroyed my understanding of the book, but oh well... I just did not have the patience to jump back and forth from past to the present.Lastly, the pacing was a bit off at times. Sometimes the book went slowly and then it soared. What I did enjoy about the book were the characters. Jonah, Chaz, and Raffy were such sweethearts. They were great friends to Taylor! I loved their backgrounds and I did not feel as though Marchetta left any of them out when it came to character development. I appreciated that. I also enjoyed the beautiful writing, though that is not a surprise when it comes to Marchetta. Her writing is perfection. Overall, I could not handle the feels at many parts of this book. Hell, I cried reading the prologue, and the story didn't even start at that time. I realized. Do you guys ever categorize authors when you pick up their books multiple times? Like, great, I already know this book will shatter my feels forever. Melina Marchetta IS that author. She rips open your heart and forces you to read, paying attention to every character and every heartbreak. I get a sick feeling sometimes when I read her stories and I hate that. I honestly detest it... But that's what a brilliant author does. Thank you, Melina Marchetta.

Added to that is the fact that honestly, Hannah is incredibly unlikable. She's definitely been through some shit, but there's only so far that my patience will extend with dealing with that if I don't empathise with the character. Somehow that was lacking for me, here. I mostly wanted to shake her and tell her to get over herself, honestly. The way that she treats others, the way that she lashes out... I hated it, and mostly found myself sympathizing with other people over her.

There were a ton of emotions going on for me while I read, which seemed to arise pretty naturally from the story, without much manipulation from the author (although I thought a few plot points were somewhat emotionally excessive and gratuitous, but I'll forgive the book for that). The characters and character development were very well done. I loved Jonah, and Taylor rang true for me as a portrayal of a teenager who had grown up in very difficult circumstances and then been abandoned as a child. I really felt for most of the characters. What I loved most was how the characters frequently acted like real people, not perfect facsimiles. This made the relationships between the characters rocky at time, but much more touching.I do, however, have some criticisms. First, I just didn't \"get\" the territory wars in which the three groups of teenagers participated. The war didn't sound fun for the most part to me, in fact quite the opposite, so I don't understand why they would keep competing/fighting with each other.

Since she is telling us the story as she struggles with her role at school, her missing mother, the disappearance of a favorite adult, and needy peers, we see her frustrated state of mind. There are intriguing hints of a story that took place a generation before, and slowly the two stories connect. The ending is an unexpectedly forceful tearjerker, with happy and painful moments crushed together. At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start. There's some violence - car accidents, fights, a suicide, hints of child abuse - that are more emotionally intense than graphic, as are the brief sex scenes. Updated: she's won the Printz!

This book is a thrilling and exciting mystery that is so much fun to read, but it's also full of meaningful tender moments that moved me to tears and touched my heart.

I have really enjoyed the reading. The story, the characters, the pace are good as you could expect from Melina but I found the writing in her Lumatere\u2019s Chronicles superlative and remember Saving Francesca more captivating, even though the later is a simpler story. Still loving Merchetta, though, \nbecause I do love the second half\n.\u201dI think back to my dream of the boy, because in it I find solace. I like that word. I\u2019m going to make it my word of the year. There is something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong. Belong. Long to be.I would have liked it much more if Melina had enlightened me at least about the generation of the characters earlier in the book. There were a lot of moments during the first half where I didn\u2019t have a clue about who was who in Hanna\u2019s book or at the territorial wars, how old they were, if they were contemporaneous or whether they were related to each other or not. Part of reason why was the mystery needed to be solved (the boy of the tree in her dreams) but another part could have been easily fixed with just a few clarifications. I might have missed the hints even if they were there for me, but I know that I\u2019m not the only one out there being so confused and therefore fearing through almost all the first half to be put out of the story -That didn\u2019t really happened because I enjoy trying to get my bearings in this kind of books-. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoilering anyone with some clarifications. The book is told from Taylor Markham\u2019s -a Jellicoe Road student- point of view. Somehow her thirtysomething tutor\u2019s past in her teenage years \u2013at that time she was known as Narnie, but her actual name is Hannah- will has repercussions on Taylor\u2019s life. We get Hannah\u2019s POV in third person via a book written by her. Jellicoe Road and its summertime territorial wars against Cadets and Townies were first fought by Hannah and her friends twenty years ago, but the teens war still takes place each summer until now and those are a few of the many connecting links of both characters and stories.\u201dWe\u2019ve lost a substantial amount of territory. It\u2019s been split up between the Cadets and Townies.\u201dLove the characters. All of them, but I specially loved Griggs, Webb, Ben, Santangelo and Jude in this story (warning, I\u2019m mixing two different timelines here ;P. Don\u2019t get lost, teehee). I know, I have mentioned almost all the male characters. Melina makes up amazing male characters, all age included!The territorial wars were also fun \u2013 they brought me back sweet memories from my childhood when I read The War of the Buttons, one of the few books my father recommended to me when I was little \u2013 \u2026 and Richard booms, \u201cNo prisoners! No prisoners! \u2013 which is ridiculous, because it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to kill them, but he has this Lawrence of Arabia obsession\u2026\u201d Loved the (arch-enemies\u2019s) friendship. Love grown-ups and teens relationships. (view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier\u2019s: \u201dSuddenly, I\u2019m somewhere else, in another time. On the shoulders of a giant. I had wanted to be my father\u2019s shoulders an all this time they were Jude\u2019s. But he holds on to me in a way that Hannah never has. I feel his relief, like he hasn\u2019t held someone in a long, long time. And he\u2019s wanted to. (hide spoiler)]Loved all the love stories. They are small but so deep felt! Melina, you do write amazingly about feelings.(view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier\u2019s\u2026: He had never heard emotion from Narnie before and now\u2026 now it was so loud, so gut-wrenching that he wanted to cover his mouth with his hand. but Taylor and Jonah\u2019s was so beautiful too! (hide spoiler)]In the end it was not the big tearjerker I was fearing of (and I\u2019m happy that it wasn\u2019t) so if that\u2019s what was holding you back, that cannot be a deterrent for you either, really. As I say, you don\u2019t really need to be looking for signs of incoming tragedy as I did. Heartbreaking past tragedies are there to overshadow Taylor Markham\u2019s, Jonah Griggs\u2019s (and Hanna\u2019s) present -as it happened in Lumatere\u2019s and Charyn\u2019s kingdoms- but thanks to Melina I could handle all the sad events that took place in the Jellicoe Road in both timelines. (view spoiler)[Okay. I did cry a little at the last \u201cLook at my beautiful girl\u201d scene... but I would have thrown the kindle if Griggs had died in that damned tunnel!

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d- Jellicoe Road, PrologueAnd so begins Jellicoe Road, one of the most frustrating but rewarding books i have ever read. Jellicoe Road contains many stories; the book weaves together past and present, family and mysteries, loyalty and friendship, and at times it is heartbreakingly sad.Taylor Markham has lived at a boarding school ever since she was abandoned by her mother many years ago. The story is hard to explain; one narrative takes place in the present, with Taylor trying to figure out where her closest friend and guardian, Hannah, has disappeared to.The second story is set in the past and follows four friends. The prologue is part of this second story.The flashbacks were a breath of fresh air and the way they tie in to the present-day story is simply amazing. I had figured out the twists behind When You Reach Me because I had heard there were secrets lurking in the story; I didn\u2019t think that Jellicoe Road would have any plot twists, but when they were revealed not only was it shocking; it felt right. Not like \u201cWhat the heck was the author thinking?\u201d but \u201cAhhh, it makes sense.\u201d Just what you want in this little puzzle of a book.I could barely read this book when I first started it. Actually, that\u2019s not totally true; the introduction is simply amazing. I read the first few pages and thought that the rest of the book would be just as gripping- but instead, the plot became incredibly convoluted and confusing.The story springs right into Taylor\u2019s life without any exposition whatsoever. Usually I love these types of stories; figuring out what\u2019s happening is usually fun. But in this book, I was just frustrated.I couldn\u2019t seem to care about the characters; the back story to the plot was either to brief or vague; some plot elements made absolutely no sense until the very end. I found Taylor to be an unsympathetic lead; she seemed so caught up in her teenage angst.Reading it began to feel like a tiresome trip; I tried to encourage myself to stay with it (it won the Printz award! That prologue was breathtaking!) but I eventually just gave up and put it down for a while. After wondering if the plot actually got anywhere, I picked it up again to read the ending (it\u2019s a bad habit).And I decided to give it another try. And I was completely blown away. I couldn\u2019t put it down; I cried like i had just read the ending of The Book Thief for the first time (well, almost).Thing is, it didn\u2019t get that good until i was 3/4 through the book. Once I was about to read the final chapter, I actually decided to read the entire book from the beginning again to see what I had missed; it made the epilogue all the more powerful. Reading it the second time through, it almost seemed like another book. There are a whole bunch of little details that you miss the first time (mostly because what the heck is going on?!?!) but you can take the time to get to know the characters the second time through. And the characters, I find, are one of the most important elements of a novel.Final Verdict: An amazing book. The way the Marchetta ties together the past and present is nothing short of genius. The frustrating confusion at the beginning drags the book down but it\u2019s all worth it for the ending. ---Apparently I read and reviewed this book when I was around thirteen. Every time I re-read Jellicoe it never loses its power; although I've fallen harder for Melina Marchetta's characters in other books since then (and she's easily become my favorite author), I still marvel at how everything falls into place so skillfully here.

I started thinking about how to kick this off when I reached the halfway point in the book yesterday. I thought about starting with some kind of song. Some lyrics. Coldplay kept popping into my mind, but then I abandoned the idea and moved on. Hence, the beginning of this review is just me telling you about how I don\u2019t know how to begin.When I don\u2019t give a pretty great or well-loved book five stars, I like to explain why it lost that one star before I talk about how it earned the four. So I\u2019ll start there, and even in my criticisms, I promise to be respectful of this novel and I hope I never sound as though I didn\u2019t really love it. Because oh, how I loved it. Please don\u2019t think me over-sensitive. There are a few things that sometimes really bug me in a book. The F-word. I don\u2019t think it needed to be used so often. Of course I never think it\u2019s necessary to use it at all, but I can deal with it being in there several times. But this seemed like a lot to me. I know everyone has a different conception of a lot. I just would have liked this so much better if there hadn\u2019t been so many F-bombs. Maybe it adds realism or something for some people, but I just don\u2019t think the F-word does anything for a story but take away from it. I\u2019ve never said that word, I don\u2019t much like to hear it in my head. That being said, I\u2019d like to say that the \u201clove scenes\u201d were handled very well, being pretty vague. Less is more, people, less is more. I didn\u2019t feel like my brain was being infiltrated with filth and I didn\u2019t have to skip pages. Yay, Marchetta! If this hadn't been handled the way it was, it would have ended up being a complaint. But it's not. I applaud the author for this.And oh my goodness, these characters are wonderful. All of them. From Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, and Jude. To Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz, and even Ben. Notice that in both cases it\u2019s a group with 3 boys and 2 girls? Ben is sort of left out sometimes, but I\u2019m finding that rather interesting, even though it hasn\u2019t got much bearing on the story at all. xD Can I just say right now that I love Jonah Griggs? Okay. I love him. I also love how the two different stories are interwoven. This is literary genius. It\u2019s like a mystery but not a mystery at all. It was fun to pick apart the two stories and figure out how they fit together. It really kept me interested even through the slow parts. (view spoiler)[But I\u2019m such a dunce that I didn\u2019t figure out the thing about Fitz accidentally shooting Webb until the last chapter. Yeah, I am blushing about my stupidity. (hide spoiler)] Basically, I\u2019ve go to say, this book starts out really strangely. I was totally confused through the first few chapters. But then it starts to make sense, and it just gets better the more we figure out what\u2019s going on. If you stick with it through the odd beginning, you\u2019ll be glad you did. Finally, I\u2019d like to touch on what this book is, at its heart, about. It\u2019s about grief and hurt and it\u2019s about forgiveness. It\u2019s about getting through the toughest times and learning to trust and love. It\u2019s about learning to let people in.I know someday I'll read this again.

I am always skeptical when a book gets an overwhelming amount of rave reviews because I have been sorely disappointed too many times. No disappointment this time. JELLICOE ROAD deserves every five star review it has gotten. It took me on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and I was sad to see it end. Taylor Markham attends a boarding school in rural Australia. She has been chosen as the student leader of her house and appointed by the graduating class to lead the school in their territory war against the Cadets and the Townies. As you can imagine, the Cadets are a military school and the Townies are the local school kids. Chaz Santangelo leads the Townies and Jonah Griggs, with whom Taylor has a mysterious past, leads the Cadets. As the territory wars heat up, Taylor\u2019s house leader and ersatz mother, Hannah, disappears. Left with only Hannah\u2019s unfinished memoir as a clue, Taylor teams up with Jonah to find Hannah. Their search leads Taylor to Sydney and ultimately to self-discovery. Have your tissues handy! I guarantee you will cry at least one tear when reading JELLICOE ROAD. My heart broke when I read this book, but ultimately the message was one of hope and redemption. Although it was sad and dark at times, I found it refreshing to read a YA novel that was where good things don\u2019t just drop out of the air for the heroine. Real life isn\u2019t like that, and boy does Taylor Markham know it. I had absolutely no idea what was going on for the first few chapters of the book. For a while I thought I was reading a dystopian novel or something. Then the fog started clear and things actually started to make sense; from then on, I was engrossed. After finishing the novel, I decided I liked how confusing everything was in the beginning. It\u2019s a lot like Taylor herself: she didn\u2019t really know who she was, who her family was, or why she was at the Jellicoe School. Taylor\u2019s journey of self-discovery was paced equally with my own discovery of what the heck was happening. Ingenious! Loved that little element. Part of my confusion was about Taylor and Jonah\u2019s past. What happened to them? How did the y meet? Who was The Hermit? What did Jonah do to his father? The details about their shared past were slowly revealed. By the time I had the entire picture of how they met and their past mistakes, I was rooting for both of them and for their budding romance. The carefully doled-out details of their history really added depth both to their character development and to their relationship development. Although I was skeptical of all the gushing reviews for JELLICOE ROAD, I am so glad I picked it up and read it.

This book left me speechless.What do you want me to say? What could I possible say? It was so overpowering and magnificent that left me with no words. Seriously, I have never read a contemporary book so, so good! Melina Marchetta is beyond my understanding. First, I idolized her for the only book I read of hers, Finnikin of the Rock. Now, she absolutely left me speechless. Jellicoe Road is something else, something indescribable, something capable to marvel any reader around the world. It doesn't matter the genres you prefer nor your age or your cultural background because Jellicoe Road is capable to reach the most inner core of human being, the soul.How can so much sadness and love belong -long to be- to the same place? I wonder... how is that possible? in this book it is. Two stories masterfully intertwine on the Jellicoe Road, linking the past and the present, the characters and their stories. This book is a Road full of enriching, humane and soul-touching life experiences about self-discovery, belonging, understanding and forgiveness. This book is certainly a Road you'll want to walk by yourself and absorb everything it has to offer.I am so ashamed to say that I waited so long to read this book, but I am also proud to say that now I have this book on my shelf. I knew Jellicoe Road would amaze me, Finnikin of the Rock which is also by Melina Marchetta, highly did and I was ready to read something absolutely great in this book. However, what I did not expect was that Jellicoe Road would touch every single cell of my body with such strength that even my soul would be overpowered. The intensity of this book will absorb readers's souls and wont let them go until they shed the last tear. After that, it will be the readers that wont let go of this book.Melina Marchetta must be a writer sent by God or something, because I doubt I'll ever read something like this ever again. For me, she excels among any YA writer and Jellicoe Road is the physical proof of it. The lyrical and emotionally evocative writing style will steal your breathe countless of times. The characters, the plot and the countless themes in this story, makes this book a must-read and a must-have. I don't know what else I can say to express how I feel about this book. How can I let readers know that they should pick Jellicoe Road and read it not only once but twice, and then a third time and a fourth... Seriously, this is a book to re-read. I certainly want to walk over and over again on the Jellicoe Road.Jellicoe Road is a story that has certainly engraved itself into readers' heart and memory and it will certainly engrave its own mark through history. Now, if you haven't read this book yet, go and get it as soon as you can and turn to the first page...

I thought The Piper\u2019s Son was brilliant. This book is obviously so much more than that. I had used brilliant to sum up my entire feeling towards The Piper\u2019s Son, so what is that one adjective that surpasses brilliant just so I can do this book justice? Just like the rating scale, I feel the adjectives are limited and would not convey my truest feeling I have for this book. Ugh, this is so frustrating. If anything, this book merits recognition from the entire human population if not the universe as a whole. There, that should count for something, right?You know, if I had ever doubted Marchetta\u2019s writing competency in the past, that feeling was now completely eradicated and I have this book to thank for that. I\u2019m not implying she doesn\u2019t write well because she does write well. The point is On the Jellicoe Road is so adeptly written, you\u2019ll be reminded the reasons you worship Marchetta. This book particularly is the greatest reminder of all.On the Jellicoe Road is an engulfing read. I won\u2019t lie to you and say that you\u2019ll dote on the book right from the very first page because you won\u2019t, though I have no doubt the lyrical prose will immediately pull you in. Truth be told, I was disoriented for about 100++ pages or so because I felt everything was all over the place and didn\u2019t seem to follow the conventional storytelling. In other words, it was like reading the story from backward. But do not be disheartened by it, my fellow comrades. The unconventional storytelling is exactly what On the Jellicoe Road needsto make it an outstanding reading. As the story progresses, the plot is revealed bits by bits and when you\u2019ve finally caught on with what\u2019s happening, I swear to God, you\u2019ll be so consumed in the story you\u2019ll forget everything else that doesn\u2019t have to do with the book. You\u2019ll forgive Marchetta for making things so confusing in the beginning because the story as a whole is so worth the damn twisty route. I am already missing the book as we speak. This is one of the books that I wouldn't mind if it went on forever. In fact, I demand for it. I don\u2019t know how to do this book justice, my words won\u2019t cover even an inch of that, so I think the best way to do it is to encourage for you to read it for yourself. Except I won\u2019t encourage. That's too mild. I will bug you until you all have given in. But seriously, give it a go.  Recommended! P.s.: Psst! Just between you and me, I think Marchetta made a pact with the Devil because this book (and all of her other books I've read) are to die for, no kidding!

But there's nothing more endearing for me than a tale about friendship, family, loss and trying to do the right thing. Last year I read Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, it was my first book by this writer, and while I loved her writing style and narration, I couldn't fully connect with the story, the characters were likeable and the story was full of witty remarks and smart little jokes, but still it was just an ok read, for me. But Jellico Road! oh man! this book broke my heart, but it was so worth it!Jellico Road is centered in Taylor's story, her life, we help her discover where she comes from, what mysteries surrounds her and the people around her, and how everything intertwines with her mother's childhood, her only companion Hannah, the manuscript Hannah is writing and the man that visits Taylor every night in her dreams. This book was magical, really! the atmosphere, the sadness and melancholy aspects of the story are things I've only encountered once or twice in books, and those are the sort of books you go back to from time to time, looking for that little spark of emotion that most YA contemporary lack nowadays. I love how Melina's writing is not pretentious or manipulative, even thought its a very emotional book. I feel like some authors play with our emotions and calculate every scene in their story with some sort of \"cue for crying part\" bits, they manipulate the reader and they plan every aspect of their books, and strategically place the sobfest bits in order to get a reaction from us. Melina does emotional and sadness in a effortlessly manner, and I loved that about this book. Those are the books that really catch me of guard. The only struggle I had with Jellicoe Road were the first 100 pages. It was confusing to read about all this territory wars between the schools and the Cadets, it was not very interesting to me, and I would've like it a lot more if in between all this sort of \"useless\" details we maybe get to know Taylor a bit more. Also, I think the author dedicates too much time in that aspect of the story that serves little purpose at the conclusion and resolution of the problematic in hand. Regardless of my struggles with the first part, I 100% recommend this book! I think all you need is patience and curiosity to not DNF this book. The writing style and pace makes it easy to continue reading, and once you hit the 53% ish mark, you can't put it down. I will definitely will re read this book at some point, and I'm not a big rereader, but this one deserves it. And I will definitely checkout other books by Melina Marchetta, I'm sold on discovering more of her work, if this is just a little taste of what she can do.

I\u2019ve read books by Melina Marchetta before, the Lumatere Chronicles, but this is a contemporary novel and that was a high fantasy series. Completely different worlds, but the execution of the entire story was impeccably done in a way that left me heart broken, jubilant and full of wonder all at the same time. This book was amazing.Jellicoe Road is a book best gone into without really know what it\u2019s about so I\u2019m going to be very vague with the details. Its a book about loss, rivalry, death, pain, confusion, secrets, hopelessness, and fear. But its also about friendship, trust, wonder, faith, family and LOVE. While reading this book I was happy, sad, angry, afraid, confused, I laughed and cried, felt sorry for the characters in some instances and was proud of their triumphs and bravery in others. Every character in this book has a role and every single one of them plays an important part in the overall arc of the story which was a roller coaster ride in and of itself. There were times when I was reading and I felt like there were pieces of the puzzle that I had to find and fit together. And then there were times when I felt like the puzzle was already finished but I had to take it apart and examine each individual piece to really understand what was going on. It was an amazing feeling while reading. Being given little bits and pieces of information but not knowing their significance until hundreds of pages later and realizing just how important a small line or an entire passage was. Melina Marchetta did an amazing job of weaving this intricate and complicated story together in a way that kept me not only invested but actively interested in what was going on at all times. I literally could not put this book down. I had to know what was going on, I had to find the next piece of the puzzle and figure out how it fit into the overall story. An overall story about overcoming adversity and conquering your fears, learning to forgive and allowing yourself to love. An overall story that turned out to be both beautiful and tragic. I know this a very obscure review but just know that this book is definitely worth a read. If you liked Winger by Andrew Smith you will LOVE this book. And if you hated Winger you will LOVE this book. Definitely give it a try. Winger was one of my favorite books of 2014 but it pales in comparison to Jellicoe Road.This book is one of the most heartfelt and poignant books I\u2019ve ever read with a message that is universal to anyone who reads it.

Most of the time I'm not quite sure what I'm feeling. It's some kind of overwhelming empathy and humanity and just pure raw emotion. And every time I get that feeling, I remember why I love books so much. On The Jellicoe Road definitely had that effect on me. I got into this book knowing nothing about it. Nothing at all. Nada. And for the first third of the novel, I was confused. I did not know where it was going, not even sure what was going on. Who are these people? What is this \"war\" they're talking about? What is this? But I'm actually glad I got into this book like that. The introduction was great for what it was ahead of if, the set up for the plot was beautifully done. That kind of introduction was perfect to lead to the mysteries that followed.And once again, I'm so glad I did not know anything coming in. It enhanced the experience. I took in details I may have never had thought of. This is a perfect example of the \"just get into the story without knowing what's about\" kind of book.I kind of fell in love with Marchetta's writing. Even though I was confused at the beginning, I found myself drawn to these words. I had to keep on reading. There's something mesmerizing about how she put together this story. The way the two perspectives were woven together. The darkness of it. I love YA that does not censures itself and this one definitely did not. The grimness of some of the mysteries revealed gave even more dimension to this whole story. The characters, god I love this characters so much. I fell in love with them. I care for them. I wanted so badly to things to go right all the time for them. Although the story got a bit predictive towards the middle that didn't matter cause I cared about the characters. Flawed, three-dimensional, well-written characters. And as usual for me, it was the characters that made me love the story. Plotwise, there were some elements that did not completely fit in and I wished for a more thorough explain, or an explanation at all about these holes.

Yet I failed, which caused me to miss out on this excellent book until now. When I tried reading it previously, I was deterred by the initial chapters. Several characters are introduced and discerning the relations between them is difficult. The narrative voice and year switches without notice, and there is something about a battle between Townies, Cadets, and Houses but it's nearly impossible to figure out what it is. Later on, of course, I realized how crucial these chapters are to the story and their confusing nature sets up much of the plot; however, for a person sitting down to read this without any previous knowledge of the book, I understand why he or she may leave it unfinished. If I recommend this book to anyone (and I likely will since it's fantastic), I will reassure them that the beginning is confusing and hard but it will all make sense in a wonderful book payoff. Besides the beginning, the rest of the book is nearly flawless, except for perhaps some of the ending. Jellicoe Road is a dramatic book, but near the end, I felt like it somewhat descended to melodrama, but maybe that's just my apathetic, unfeeling self talking. I was willing to excuse it because of the book's dramatic nature; I mean, the story commences with an accident involving five fatalities. Squashed between the minorly problematic beginning and end is a glorious middle section crammed with territory games, discoveries of past stories, a magnificent love interest, and even a serial killer! When I remember this novel, though, I'll think of the friendships shared between the original five friends--Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude (even their names are amazing)--and the modern friends--Taylor, Griggs, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben. The adventures of the original five, though tainted with sadness, reminded me of when I was younger, traipsing around with a troop of neighborhood kids, inventing wild games from morning until the moon came up. Although none of my childhood friends died, we are no longer close, so the nostalgia and regret felt by Narnie and Jude reflected something I think all grown-up childhood friends must cope with: the loss of that idyllic time and its relationships.

This is probably one of those \u2018very good\u2019-on-a-first-read-but-\u2018outstanding\u2019-on-a-re-read books.Melina Marchetta tackles some of the big themes in this book: About parents leaving their children, about tragic events that ripple through the rest of your life and into that of the next generation. About relationships you don\u2019t actually know the significance of, and about the meaning of \u2018home\u2019.I do have to admit that this book didn\u2019t have the same emotional gut-punching power her other earth-based young adult novels have (Saving Francesca, The Piper\u2019s Son). I had heaps of Kleenex next to me, but it wasn\u2019t necessary.

Structurally, I believe it was more confusing at the start than it needed to be. Why are we reading the manuscript as a reader before Taylor finds it? Wouldn\u2019t it have been more logic to wait?Content-wise there are a few gaps too that don\u2019t get explained (spoilers ahead): why did Hannah leave without saying a word \u2013 it seemed totally out of character? Why did Hannah never mention what her relationship was to Taylor \u2013 it seemed like there were many options here? I also could have done with less teen romance to be honest, because the relationship between the adults and the kids are what made this book so exquisite, and the romance angle got in the way for me.Still, it\u2019s a really good young adult novel, and I definitely enjoyed reading it.

Finishing this book is one of the reasons that I love reading reviews before I actually read the book. If I hadn't read the reviews I wouldn't have known that every single one of them urges you to keep going--to plod through the beginning and finish the book, and I may have given up and not read past the first 30 pages or so. The first half of this book is like being the lobby of a beautiful hotel in a foreign country. You love your surroundings but you don't know what the hell is going on because no one speaks your language. Eventually the pieces in the story fall into place which allows you to slow down and focus on the words and the feelings behind them rather than spinning madly trying to figure out what is going on. I know that this is a writing technique held in high regard but between us, I thought that the book was wonderful regardless/would have been even more powerful if Marchetta had just let the reader know what was happening from the beginning. It wasn't until I understood the relationship of the characters that I was able to latch onto to them and believe that they were real. Of course, it's not my novel, so who am I to decide? And I understand in retrospect that we were learning the story in the same way that Taylor learned her own story--in bits and pieces and not in chronological order. I spent a lot of the time reading this book with that dry, scratchy feeling that your throat gets right before you are going to cry. It's pretty heartbreaking and the characters are sad in that beautiful, stilled-in-time sort of way. The only thing I can actually say that I disliked about the novel was the whole territory storyline which seemed to dominate the first half and which I didn't really understand.

In any case, Jellicoe Road is fantastic and a book I will cherish for a long time to come.Taylor and Jonah's relationship is INTENSE. In addition to being leaders of opposing teams in the turf war, they have history. Oh, and what a history. They met 3 years earlier and spent a few days together. These few days transformed each of their lives. The beginning of their relationship consisted of each being utterly vulnerable to one another. Even though they didn't see each other or talk in the years that followed, they couldn't possibly forget each other and what happened between them. This history makes their present day interactions heated and explosive. Despite this, there is a tenderness between them that is, at first, so subtle. You see it building through the course of the book into a love that is convincingly true. Actually, you get to see how they fell in love with each other twice, once at age 14 and then presently -- with the first fueling the second. Each of them is fiercely independent and, due to misunderstandings from their earlier history, they are so cold to each other when they meet again in the present. Reading about their relationship conjures up the image of an iceberg melting into warm, soothing spring water. You get to see how these initially strong, negative reactions to one other transform into very strong, loving, self-sacrificing openness to one another. As individuals, they each carry around so much pain. At their best, they are able to offer solace to one another in a way no else can.

I picked it up and read it. I can see why it is so well-loved. Jellicoe Road is a moving story full of heartache and hope.I'm going to keep this review short because I think it's better to go into the story knowing as little as possible. You're guaranteed to be confused but trust me when I say it's better that way. The mysterious air made the characters much memorable and the story more profound.As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of the story, I was very confused. Nevertheless I found myself completely engrossed in piecing together the stories. There was so much love but also great losses. The closer we got to the big picture, the more anxious and dread I felt. The way the story flowed made it so you know the undeniable truths but you really don't want the reality to be confirmed. Ms. Marchetta skillfully ties everything in. You don't know you needed the little details (view spoiler)[(the postman in Yass lol) (hide spoiler)] until they're given to you.The story of Jellicoe Road is thoughtful and quietly intense. There were many different types of relationships and they were all very sweet. Each subtle on the surface but overflowing with feelings at its center. \"Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\" (p. 262).The territory war was my favourite. I love a good rivalry and seeing the boarders, Townies and Cadets in action was such good fun. They meant business but not so serious that they couldn't be friends and have some laughs together. Even if no one knew how it all started, it was a meaningful game.A book rich in emotions with excellent characterization, Jellicoe Road is a must-read for readers of all genre and all age. I cannot recommend this book enough.

Like, seriously, if you've heard that this book is complex, profound, absorbing, fascinating, gritty, depressing, and downright flawless...well, you're about to hear it again.Basically, I can't even give you a brief summary, I mean, God knows, there's enough and I just hope you're reading this to get my opinion, not hear another person give you the shortened facts. I wish I could, really, I do, but I feel if I dwell too much on the storyline, I'll completely lose sight of what made this book so magical, and that - in my opinion - is the raw emotions and feelings that a brief summary on the back of a book can't give you.I mean, gosh, it's been less than ten minutes since I finished it and I feel like a basket-case on withdrawel. I've been known to read/adore tragic books (Looking For Alaska by John Green being one of my all-time favorites) but Jellicoe Road takes tragic, depressing, shocking, and haunting to a whole new level, and if you think I'm overreacting or even not thinking straight, then you haven't read this book properly.If I had to pick one qualm about the book, it would be that you really had to perservere past the first 50 pages. Even I was ready to be all like \"Ehh, I don't know if I'll finish this\" most of the time, but I think around page 70 I realized there was no way I could put this book down, crappy or not.Pfft, I can't even talk about the characters, storyline(s), or anything, I'm still reeling.Just...read the book.

I'm not going to lie--the first 150 pages took me FOREVER to get through, and there were quite a few times when I considered not finishing the book. Why? Mainly because I was confused. Nothing made sense to me, and the plot seemed extremely fragmented.I do have to say that I am EXTREMELY glad I didn't end up giving up on Jellicoe Road. After finishing the book, I realized that the confusing beginning to the story played a part in the overall theme of the novel, and it really added to the point the author was trying to get across.After I waded through the beginning of the book, I flew right through the rest of the book. Jellicoe Road is a near masterpiece. It's an absolutely beautiful book--up there with Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. It's a great coming-of-age story, and as soon as I finished the last page, I got the urge to start over. I think Jellicoe Road will make for a great re-read, and I'd really like to go back through those pages I struggled with, because I think I'll enjoy them a lot more knowing what I do now.The writing style was beautiful. You know those books that make you want to take out a notebook and jot down quotes? Jellicoe Road is one of those. Furthermore, the characters were loveable and realistic. They'll make you laugh, they'll make you cry, they'll make you angry--everything good characters should do.I'm definitely adding the rest of Marchetta's books to my TBR list!", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["re-read-list", "young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/152074292", "review_id": "152074292", "date": "Mar 04, 2011", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Shelli", "user_url": "/user/show/1561203-shelli", "text": "Have you ever finished a book and thought that you were somehow supposed to read it? To think and to learn and to be better for it? Enough said...this book touched me in a very personal way and I loved it.The characters were wonderful....I loved the original five plus Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz and Jessa...and all the secondary characters I liked as well. I also loved the setting....I had to keep reminding myself this was set in the present....the Jellicoe school became it's own little world to me. I really enjoyed the \"territory wars.\" It was nice to have something fun to offset the heavy emotional stuff. I loved the relationships....I loved what this book says about life and how we are each dealt one, left to choose how to live it. I listened to the audio of this and I'm glad I did. The narrator was excellent. I was confused in the beginning until I realized we are supposed to be. The story unfolds and we figure out the answers along the way. It is quite a journey. I was walking and had tears streaming down my face, but it was worth it. I didn't know how far I was from the end. The music would play and I would think...please don't be the end yet.....and it wasn't! It didn't end until I felt satisfied. We didn't know how everything would end up, but we were left in a good place...where we could imagine on our own. I am not a reader who reads books more than once.....there are too many out there waiting for me. This is a book where I didn't wish for a sequel because I know I will read it again.

This book.And I expected to like it, but I kept my reservations. Maybe I'd be the exception. Maybe I'd be that one who it just didn't work for, who didn't understand.I should've known it would end in this: 2 AM, tired eyes, and a mind that's never been more awake.

There are so, so many things I could say.But I'll never say enough for this book, so here's what I can tell you: I read it in a day. I laughed. I grew furious. Grew happy again. Curled on a small, painful couch and read for hours and hours and hours until my eyes wanted to blur but I wouldn't let them, because I had to finish, I had to. And then they did blur, despite it all, and I cried. Just for a moment.And a few pages later, the book was done.", "num_likes": 5, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["beautiful"]}]
