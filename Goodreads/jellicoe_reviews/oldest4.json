It has a lot about family, friendship, love, growing up, letting go and holding on-at the same time, sadness and joy with a lot of laughs in between.

Each fall, the students at the school engage in a \"war\" with the townies and a group of cadets that come to camp in the woods near the school. Each team has their own territory, and there are constant skirmishes between the groups. Taylor is appointed the leader of her group, so the book is divided into a plotline about the battle, but interspersed with stuff about Taylor's past life and the mystery behind her mom's disappearance.

It's only appropriate, really, for the beginning to confuse us, since Taylor is sort of lost herself. Since she is telling us the story as she struggles with her role at school, her missing mother, the disappearance of a favorite adult, and needy peers, we see her frustrated state of mind. There are intriguing hints of a story that took place a generation before, and slowly the two stories connect. The ending is an unexpectedly forceful tearjerker, with happy and painful moments crushed together. At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start. There's some violence - car accidents, fights, a suicide, hints of child abuse - that are more emotionally intense than graphic, as are the brief sex scenes. Updated: she's won the Printz!

Our primary narrator for the novel is Taylor Markham, who was abandoned by her mother at a 7-eleven on Jellicoe Road when she was 11 years old. As Taylor reluctantly accepts a leadership role at her school and leads the war against the townies and cadets, she also starts down a path of self discovery, where she discovers her own history and who she really is.Nothing in this novel is as it seems and it takes quite a while for the pieces of the puzzle to begin to fall into place. Once you get to that part, though, it becomes nearly impossible to put the book down. Highly recommended.Cautions for sensitive readers: There is some profanity in the book and some sexual situations. There is also a violent car accident that is referred to with some graphic depictions.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["with-reviews", "teen-realistic-fiction", "teen-mystery", "favorites", "teen-romance"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44417537", "review_id": "44417537", "date": "Jan 26, 2009", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Janssen", "user_url": "/user/show/23760-janssen", "text": "Wow, this book was amazing.

It took a good \u00bc to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I\u2019m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn\u2019t be rereading this book in the near future, about \u00be the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy. Given how much pleasure I got from reading it, perhaps I\u2019m wrong and perhaps just the right amount of content was included.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years.

The book deals with the following developmental markers: surviving on your own/becoming independent, reconciling with your past, developing positive adult relationships, forgiveness, and understanding. I thought that the characters were believable. Taylor really appealed to me and drew me into the story. I wanted her to do well and succeed. I also liked the relationships amongst the characters; I thought they were realistic and believable. I was a bit doubtful that there would really be \u201cterritory wars\u201d as described in the book, but upon understanding the history behind their creation, I can see how that would really happen too. In a sense, Taylor\u2019s experiences could be a representation for the types of conflict that occur on a much larger scale around the world.

The first chapter left me awestruck- it was an incredible beginning. However, the next 100 pages are comprised of two stories that swirl around one main character who frankly, is less than likable in the beginning. After the 200 page mark, it is apparent that the structure emulates the main character's confusion- the reader is already beginning to piece together what the main character is beginning to suspect. It is tedious work, but the payoff is worth it- once the story picks up and the characters begin to interact, the story is quite enjoyable. I took off one star for two reasons. One is due to editing. I felt that structurally, the reader could relate to the main story of Jellicoe Road, but the reader never really relates to the secondary story. With as many pages and development allocated by the writer, there should have been more development or in my opinion, less of the secondary story except in the development of the main story (I'm trying to write this without spoiling anything here). There are also some basic mistakes, as noted in other reviews- the ethnicity of one character contradicts itself, there are unexplained lapses in time during scenes, and so on.Finally, this is supposed to be an award-winning book, with an emphasis on literary achievement. While Jellicoe Road does not lack this, I personally see this book as having a rather limited teen audience. I work in a public library, and there is a certain type of teen who would be willing to put in the effort to navigate the complexities of this novel- a novel that is sometimes overly complex and at times somewhat inaccessible. I worked through the first third of the book because it was a Printz winner, and I felt an obligation to finish it. I wonder if teens would do the same- it's not difficult, but it can be a chore. And who wants to make their leisure reading a chore? (This isn't me advocating Twilight for the Printz award, but really, let's take into account the audience of a book, and not just what adults/professionals think).

The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?\u201d and my father said, \u201cNarnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d and that was the last thing he ever said.-------------------------------With a beginning like that, how could you put it down? Well, I did, two times, but the third time\u2026well\u2026wow. Every once in awhile, a book comes along that just hits you in the gut. It hits too close to home, it tears your heart out, it grabs you by the roots of your hair and spins and doesn\u2019t turn loose until well after the last page has been turned. Jellicoe Road did all these things to me and so much more.Taylor Markham has been living at the Jellicoe Road boarding school since her mother abandoned her at the nearby 7-Eleven six years earlier. She doesn\u2019t really know what happened to her father; only that he has been gone for most of her life. Now she\u2019s seventeen has been newly elected to the post of student leader of her dorm and to lead the Underground Community as one of the three boarding schools who battle for territory (among other things) in her small Australian community. The two other gangs are called the Cadets and the Townies. For years these three camps have fought in the \u201cTerritory Wars;\u201d wars fought over land, trees, water, and more. Everything is going swimmingly, until Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family disappears without a word. Jonah Griggs, the boy Taylor ran away with three years ago and the leader of the Cadets has popped back into her life with smoldering looks and mystifying behavior. And all the young kids of Taylor\u2019s house are now looking to her for everything. Things start falling apart.Understandably Taylor wants to know what\u2019s going on with Hannah. We are given glimpses of a novel that Hannah has been working on, which at first Taylor takes to be fictional but quickly realizes that it might not be so fictional. It provides an all important glimpse of Hannah\u2019s, and Taylor\u2019s, life. As she gets closer and closer to the truth the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and, well, good luck putting the book down. This is an absorbing story where nothing is quite what it seems and the clues only lead to more questions for Taylor, as she tries to work out the connections between herself, Hannah, her mother and the character\u2019s in Hannah\u2019s book. This is a book about secrets, anguish, pain, love, betrayal, hope, death, life and oh so much more. It\u2019s heartbreaking and beautiful. It\u2019s gorgeous and haunting. It\u2019s going to live with me for a long time, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m so glad I gave it that third try.Oh and this is important.

I got to the end, and just as many other reviewers have said, immediately started again from the beginning.The main character is Taylor, a GIRL, and a student at the boarding school on Jellicoe Road. She's almost an orphan, and lives there year-round, since her mother left her at the age of nine. But Taylor knows there's a lot about her mother's life she doesn't know, and the READER knows it must have something to do with that other timeline. The hard part, the part that takes patience, is reading far enough into the book to find out how.In the meantime, the students of the boarding school are in a complicated wargame they play every year, with the townies and the cadets over territory, that is both fascinating and amusing. Adding to the fun, the intimidating leader of the cadets has a history with Taylor, leader of the students, and the leader of the townies has a history with Taylor's second in command, Raffaela. Oh! And there's a serial killer of kids lurking in the background of the story, too. Listen, just GO with it.

The beginning was not particularly enthralling, but the story definitely evolved towards the end. I can see why some people may not enjoy this book- usually my favourites capture my attention in the first few pages. On The Jellicoe Road was definitely an exception to my rule. The second half of the book excused the slow beginning.The emotion in the book was so raw and touching. Once you understood the relationships and how everyone was linked, you could not help but be affected by the characters' stories. The story went in an opposite direction to what I was expecting by reading the first 100 or so pages. The plot seemed a bit silly and unemotional at the beginning, but it takes a quick change. I don't really want to go into the storyline, because it takes an unpredictable course. When I read this book I had no idea what to expect, and my confusion wasn't really resolved until I was half way into the story.

She does not know much about her past and only has a few scattered memories of her early childhood. When she was eleven, her mother abandoned her at a gas station and a woman who lives next to her school picked her up and brought her to the school. Taylor knows that Hannah has some connection to her past, and worries when she disappears without letting Taylor know where she is going or when she will be back. While Taylor worries about her mysterious past and Hannah\u2019s location, she is also supposed to be leading her school in the annual territory wars between the townies and visiting cadets. She is also perplexed by unsettling dreams and a story about five friends who used to go to her school. Can Taylor figure out her past and not let her school down? Or will she cave under the stress?Like many people have said, this book begins slowly, but picks up as the novel progresses and the storylines start coming together. I think that the characters and plot could be appealing to some teens, particularly those who like a challenge and appreciate lots of description.

No one ever explains what's going on* and it's set in an unrealistic and unbelievable high school situation (\"wars\" for territory of trails, buildings, etc between townies, cadets, and the leader of the six houses of a boarding school which in itself seems unlikely and unrealistic) where no one goes to class. Even by the end, you know you need to reread it all to fully get what happened. So, in other words, a perfect candidate for a Printz, no?*Which yes, I get, is the point since Taylor has no damn clue herself but a little background would have made a difference.I didn't like the bits between chapters, even after I figured out what they were and that I shouldn't have been skimming them. Sometimes in a book, these sorts of breaks are nice but here they caused an ugh! and a flipping to see how many pages I had to get through.BUT - and this is an all caps worthy but - by the end, I really liked it.Here's the thing: I was mad at the book but I wanted to keep reading. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but you'll reach a shift where you stop reading just to plow through and start reading because you don't want to put it down. You've just got to be willing to stick with it long enough to make that happen.The massive mystery unwinds slowly but, and you've got to trust me here, it's worth it. There's a large cast of characters to keep track of, but (again after 200 pages) Taylor, Griggs, Raffaela, and Santangelo pull away and you don't feel so lost. Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that while the reading experience is having lots of pieces thrown at you, Marchetta's a good enough writer to hold it all together. A note on stars / recommendation / ages:Firmly between 4-5 stars, if you keep reading. I'd happily reread the second half, no doubtRecommendations are tough. It's worth recommendations but not for all patron and maybe a \"stick with it\" kind of comment should be included.Also - the Horn Book said 12-14. Roger Sutton, I adore you, but you're crazy. I can't imagine that's where most readers will fall. I'd say 10th on up--not because it's inappropriate for middle school (albeit dark at times in plot and topics) but because it's a text that requires some work and effort to get through.

I see that in this book as well as the author's previous books that most of the problems for her teenage protagonists, the thing that sends them over the edge and makes all the adults suddenly worry and pay attention, is that they aren't told all the information. The adults around them, trying to \"protect them,\" hide information. The teenagers want the answers, especially this character who doesn't know who she is or where she came from. And when you're at an age where you're trying to define who you are, not knowing is a big deal.

I really really liked this book. I was advised (not by people I know, but by bloggers) to stick with this one, even if the beginning frustrates you beyond all reason.

There were a few things I had issues with : one, Taylor is hinted at being an unreliable narrator a few times, but it didn't really become an issue in the telling of the story - it wasn't a Catcher in the Rye kind of unreliable narrator sort of situation, but there were a few discrepancies between her story and the stories put forth by other characters. Might have just been me getting my panties in a bunch over nothing. The other thing (and this might be a big thing for some readers) is that I put the pieces together too soon. Before the narrator. In some cases many many pages before the narrator. While I do pride myself on being an expert reader, this bugs me. I feel like I shouldn't know something WAY before the main character does. I should maybe think...could that be? nah, there would have been more hints....not Oh I get it now. Wait....she doesn't? Seriously? So yeah. Other than those two points, I really liked this book.

The second half really picked up, and the story started to make a bit of sense and finally at the end, the reward was well worth the wait.If I could rate the book in parts, I'd give the first half about three stars, the next quarter four stars, and the end four and a half to five. I guess that with all the confusion at the beginning, I wasn't AS caught up in the story as I could have been so the payoff at the end wasn't a solid five even though I did really enjoy it.I love stories that weave themselves together, making unrelated strands all have a clear place in the tale by the end. Holes is another really enjoyable example.I'd definitely read more of Melina Marchetta. One side note: I did find it interesting that the US version of this book is just called \"Jellicoe Road\" instead of \"On the Jellicoe Road.\" I wonder why they bothered to change it?

I generally try not to give away spoilers, but I'm going to clue you in on part of a spoiler here, because otherwise the first part of the book would be nearly impossible to follow. There are large sections of italics in the first half of the book. This is another story, written by another character in the book (not saying who, although the reader will figure it out quickly). The first half is a bit disjointed at times, which makes sense because the main character, Taylor Markham, isn't sure where she fits in. She finds herself the reluctant leader of a private school dorm, thrust into planning the annual schemes the school puts up against the Cadets and Townies. Taylor's life is shaken further when Hannah, an adult counselor of sorts who lives on the school grounds, vanishes overnight. Taylor's mother abandoned her near the school when she was 11, and the teen always saw Hannah as a mother figure. She is especially worried because of additional reports of young girls going missing. In addition, it seems like Taylor's closest peers and adults know more about her past than she does -- are are reluctant to give her any details. As I said -- the first half of the book is a bit disjointed, but it's not too bad. Things finally get rolling with the confrontations between the teens at the school, the Townies and the Cadets, and the story finds its stride when the students go on vacation. At that point is when the book becomes purely exhilerating, and the wrap-ups end on many unexpected twists.

At first I was more interested in the side story, which appears in italics, than the main story of Taylor. However, once more of Taylor\u2019s past is revealed and Jonah appears, I was hooked. As more of Taylor is revealed, you begin to understand why so many people try to protect her, even when she is not being nice in return. You cannot help but want to protect her. She just wants to have a mother, to have someone who will love her and not leave her in the middle of nowhere and never look back. As the side story and Taylor\u2019s begin to interconnect, you understand why Taylor was left with Hannah.Teens can relate to Taylor and her school life. So many times high school can feel like a war between the different caste systems. At Taylor\u2019s school, it actually is war. Her need to find Hannah, her reliance on Jonah, who should be her enemy in this war, and her friends are all relatable. In addition, the side story, of how a tragic event can break apart a group of friends and wreak havoc on their future, can also appeal to teens. Friends share so much at this age that most teens are bound to have dealt with situations that solidified friendships for years to come. While Taylor seems one-dimensional at first, she grows into a solid, three-dimensional character by the end. I would have to talk about this book to promote it. Just looking at the cover or reading the jacket flap is not enough to know this book is worth reading. I would tease the two connecting stories and give a hint of Taylor\u2019s emotional conflicts that relate directly to the side story.4Q, 4P, J/S", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["kent-ya-class", "printz-award"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/55105625", "review_id": "55105625", "date": "May 05, 2009", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Muphyn", "user_url": "/user/show/1253753-muphyn", "text": "It took me a bit to get into it but once I listened to CD #1 again, I was hooked.

There are several things about it that bothered me. For instance, the writing is grandiose and overly dramatic to the point of being kind of ridiculous and annoying (Did she really count 132 minutes? Was that before or after Tate crawled over and held their hands? Did they all sit in the same spot for 2 hours and 12 minutes, counting the time? Before Fitz arrived? And then the cars blew up? After 132 + 10 or so minutes? Or was the dad still alive when Fitz dragged him out? Hmmm... ) Also, there is too much omniscient narration for a story told from one person's point of view. Definitely the weak part of the story.However, the part of the book that deals with the day to day life of Taylor and her friends is fascinating and entertaining. I would have enjoyed more tales of the war between the different factions. The Australian setting is neat but negligible -- the story could have taken place in any remote place in any country. I also didn't think it was necessary to tie up every single loose end. Who cares who the serial killer is? Why state what happened to Webb when it's already heavily implied? Why make neat a story that is all about complicated messes?Overall, an enjoyable, fresh read.
