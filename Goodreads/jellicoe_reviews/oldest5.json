Taylor has always been full of questions: about her mother's whereabouts and about her father, and about what role Hannah plays into it all.But now she's seventeen, as far away from answers as ever, and with the responsibility of leading the boarders in the territory wars between them and the cadets and the townies. And then Hannah leaves under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind a bad tempered cat and a manuscript telling the story of five kids who lived on the Jellicoe Road some twenty years before.Without Hannah, Taylor is more lost than ever, and the fact that Jonah Griggs is back doesn't help matters at all. Second Glance: I've read Jellicoe Road before, I even reviewed it once before. But this time I decided to listen to the Audiobook of it when I came across the australian edition - something I hadn't done before - and while the story remained the same, it was a very different experience. I liked hearing the voices of Taylor, Jonah, Chaz and Raffy, and everyone else, I thought the narrator - Rebecca Macauley - did a good job of it, making different voices for everyone and her guy-voices were pretty good. Also, I noticed stuff about the characters that I hadn't before, like that Taylor was a bit of a Drama Queen, something that I had never noticed before. On the down side, the musical transitions between chapters and between past and present were too long and they got kind of annoying after a while. Bottom Line: Jellicoe Road remains one of my favorite books ever and I liked the Audiobook, but I still think I like the reading experience a bit better.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["teen-ya", "tearjearker", "rainy-day-reads", "lived-up-to-the-hype", "favorites", "favorite-authors", "contemporary", "aussie"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/22911966", "review_id": "22911966", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Talia Dean", "user_url": "/user/show/1185207-talia-dean", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/23726222", "review_id": "23726222", "date": "Jun 04, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Steph (Reviewer X)", "user_url": "/user/show/1169804-steph-reviewer-x", "text": "Cross posted from my \nblog review\n.This is one of those books that 1) you should go into not knowing much of anything, 2) that will probably leave you very confused for the first 100 pages or so, but 3) is ultimately one you\u2019ll end up loving, or at the very least appreciating the cleverness behind the structure. Preferably you\u2019ll have read one of Melina\u2019s other books before (and if we\u2019re speaking of \u201cpreferably,\u201d that book will have been Looking for Alibrandi, because I think it\u2019s better than Saving Francesca), so you\u2019ll know Melina\u2019s a fine writer who knows what she\u2019s doing and isn\u2019t just getting sloppy.It\u2019s hard to say what Jellicoe Road is about exactly\u2014I don\u2019t want your reading experience to be ruined. And anyway, even if I did tell you what it\u2019s about, this novel has so many facets, it\u2019s hard to give a full picture without making you sit down and read it. It\u2019s a mystery novel about finding yourself; it\u2019s a family story about a girl who is, for all intents and purposes, an orphan; it\u2019s a story about friendship for a girl who always thought she was alone; and it\u2019s about a road that, immobile as it is, is constantly changing to the eye of each beholder. It\u2019s no wonder this novel is so confusing at first\u2014it\u2019s a paradox of itself.Anyway, as I was saying in the beginning, this book\u2019s different, in structure as much as plot. There are two main storylines, one from the past\u2014seventeen years before\u2014and one in the present. The Past one tells the story of five teenagers who were friends, family, and couples, all of whom had special ties to the Jellicoe Road. The Present one tells the story of one lone teenage girl who\u2019s been abandoned by her mother, who\u2019s got no recollection of her father, and who has no other family to speak of. The Present is told in real time through Taylor\u2019s first person narration; the Past is told through manuscript pages written by a woman who\u2019s been like a mother\u2014but not really a mother\u2014to Taylor ever since she was abandoned. The book basically keeps going with each storyline until both merge and you see how they\u2019re connected.Like I said: this isn\u2019t a book I\u2019ve\u2014or you\u2019ve, I\u2019d wager\u2014read before. It\u2019s original and elusive, and, when all is said and done, brilliant. It kept me at bay, grasping for clues where there just weren\u2019t any until everything made sense in a way I wouldn\u2019t have guessed.I\u2019d like to say there\u2019s a bit in here for everyone. You\u2019ve got your romance, your twisting-and-turning plot, your poetic prose, your instant solid characters, and your underlying passionate and solid storytelling.Possibly on my list of favorite YA books ever, probably my favorite Melina Marchetta, and definitely on my top ten for this year (US release date, of course).

Only moments later a woman by the name of Hannah picked her up and brought her to the Jellicoe School. Now she is seventeen and finds that Hannah is a rock in her inconsistent life. While she has Hannah, Taylor doesn't know much about her family except the horror stories she remembers of her mother. She does find comfort though in a manuscript that Hannah has written about a group of five friends who met in the worst circumstances, but delved a remarkable friendship when they only had each other. When Hannah just up and leaves, Taylor doesn't understand what has happened and she becomes a wreck. Not only does she have to deal with Hannah's disappearance, but she has just been named the head of her House and the leader of the school kids in the annual territory wars against the \"Townies\" and \"Cadets.\" In the war the three groups battle and negotiate following an extensive set of rules that might as well be history. As the war wages on Taylor learns to take an active role in her community as well as develop relationships that she never thought possible. Especially with Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets whom she already has quite a history with already. This war will be like no other. It will not only be between the normal three parties, but among friends, hearts desires, and most of all Taylor herself.From the title I was expecting a light and fun read. Wow, was I wrong. This book is filled with heartbreak, joy, laughter and sorrow. It completely blew me away and surpassed every expectation I had, even though I was expecting something completely different. Before I even get into the elements of the story I have to comment on how much talent the author has. Melina Marhetta's writing style is indescribable. It seemed that she was so comfortable writing the story and her words just flowed from page to page with great clarity. I loved how the author weaved many intricate details and mini-stories into one big story, making it like a puzzle that slowly comes together until those last couple of pieces which just fall into place. The only miff I had with this book is that it took me probably until the third chapter to actually understand what was going on. In the beginning there were two stories going on and it was hard to wrap my head around everything that was happening. After that though it seemed the author settled into writing and the story took off. Taylor without a doubt is one of the best characters that I think has ever been created. She has this true voice where you can hear and feel her emotion ring out. By the time the book had ended I felt like I knew Taylor like I know my best friends. While Taylor was the main character, the author did a fabulous job creating the other characters. Unlike many supporting characters, the characters in Jellicoe Road all had their own voices and became their own person with a real and likable personality. I highly recommend this book to readers everywhere. Whether you're a girl or a guy, you will treasure this novel and hold it near and dear to your heart for a long time to come. Jellicoe Road is a beautiful love story, a heart wrenching story of loss, a poignant self-discovery, and most of all an unforgettable tale.

In any case, Jellicoe Road is fantastic and a book I will cherish for a long time to come.Taylor and Jonah's relationship is INTENSE. In addition to being leaders of opposing teams in the turf war, they have history. Oh, and what a history. They met 3 years earlier and spent a few days together. These few days transformed each of their lives. The beginning of their relationship consisted of each being utterly vulnerable to one another. Even though they didn't see each other or talk in the years that followed, they couldn't possibly forget each other and what happened between them. This history makes their present day interactions heated and explosive. Despite this, there is a tenderness between them that is, at first, so subtle. You see it building through the course of the book into a love that is convincingly true. Actually, you get to see how they fell in love with each other twice, once at age 14 and then presently -- with the first fueling the second. Each of them is fiercely independent and, due to misunderstandings from their earlier history, they are so cold to each other when they meet again in the present. Reading about their relationship conjures up the image of an iceberg melting into warm, soothing spring water. You get to see how these initially strong, negative reactions to one other transform into very strong, loving, self-sacrificing openness to one another. As individuals, they each carry around so much pain. At their best, they are able to offer solace to one another in a way no else can.

Taylor also has to deal with Jonah Griggs, a cadet she ran away with in year seven, who betrayed her. Now he is the leader of the Cadets and anger from the past resurfaces as well as feelings neither of them can explain. On Jellicoe road you find the importance of friendship, the gutt-wrenching loss of family, and the ever present element of love.

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \"What's the difference between a trip and a journey?\" and my father said, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,\" and that was the last thing he ever said. We heard her almost straightaway. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead--just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives. Someone asked us later, \"Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?\" Did I wonder? When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of garbage, don't you know? Wonder dies.Powerful, isn't it? I won't lie...Jellicoe Road is a difficult read in many different ways. But worth it? Yes! Resoundingly yes! Why is it difficult? It weaves two stories together. The stories are seemingly unconnected...at least in the beginning. And because you--the reader--don't know what is going on...it's easy to get frustrated. Easy to get confused. We've got the past--from which the prologue serves as an introduction--and the present. (In a way it reminds me of Tamar.)The present. We've got several teens whose lives intersect--Taylor Markham, Ben Cassidy, Jonah Griggs, Chaz Santangelo, Raffaela, Jessa McKenzie--of whom Taylor is the main character. Taylor doesn't know where she fits in, \"One day when I was eleven, my mother drove me out here and while I was in the toilets at the 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, she drove off and left me there. It becomes one of those defining moments in your life, when your mother does that. It's not as if I don't forgive her, because I do\" (20). Taylor is one of many students at Jellicoe School, a boarding school; she's the leader of her dorm or \"house\". (There are six houses.) And the school tradition is that there are \"wars\" between three sects--those that live at the boarding school (led by Taylor), the Townies (led by Chaz Santangelo), and the Cadets (led by Jonah Griggs). These wars involve territories. And these games last six weeks or so. And they're a big deal for those involved. But what at first seems like a senseless, pointless book on children playing war--tactical strategies, trapping, pranking, and such--soon turns into an emotional journey of the heart, soul, and mind.Taylor Markham is concerned, worried, anxious about Hannah, a woman who is the closest thing she has to family, when she disappears without a word. One day she's there, the next day she's gone. And Taylor can't get a straight word out of any of the adults around at the school or in the town about Hannah's whereabouts. Taylor--though Hannah is still missing--likes to take refuge in Hannah's house. She loves to read Hannah's manuscript, for example, which is the story of five kids who live on Jellicoe Road: Tate, Narnie, Webb, Fitz, and Jude.I don't want to spoil this one in any way. But I think this *may* help readers out a bit. I didn't catch on that the italicized portions--the stories of Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, etc.--were written down stories. That Taylor was reading something Hannah had written down. I'm still not sure all of them are meant to be. But I think some of them are. And it is these stories which help Taylor to piece everything all together. (I had assumed that they were flashbacks. That they were there for the reader's benefit, but not for the characters within the book.)This is a book that had to grow on me.

I am a sucker for braided narratives; they read like a mystery novel for me. This was a great one. I found myself jotting notes to try to figure out how the plot lines connected long before it was evident there was much of a connection. I think that once students get into it (it does take a while for some, although I was instantly hooked) they will feel the same and try to think about how it will fit as well.So, assuming that not all teens are as into that aspect as I am, why else would this appeal to students? The novel begins with a brutal accident, one that can't help but make you root for the children who were left behind. On the other hand, the book is full of the closest types of friendships forming... The kinds of friendships that become family, whether out of need (as is shown here) or just because everyone needs that kind of bond. High school students are beginning to experience that, and to see groups of peers so passionate about friendship is something everyone can relate to... even if it's just something they have always wanted.However, I quickly learned that not everyone was as invested in reading this book as I was. Many of my classmates found the first hundred or so pages to be very confusing and therefore lost interest. For this reason, I would only really recommend it to students who love to read already. In addition, the \"war\" seems really pointless. Yes, it is explained later in the novel, but it actually makes most reviews sound like it's a science fiction novel or something, and it isn't at all. I think that this plot device, and the scant purpose for it, would distract and annoy many readers.The biggest asset to the best young adult literature is a believable cast of characters, and Marchetta is a little bit hit-or-miss on this one. Some, such as Taylor & Hannah, are incredibly believable. On the other hand, because so little is really known about all of the older cast of characters (particularly Fritz and Jude), these sometimes come off as flat characters, barely more than cardboard stand-ins.To encourage students to read this novel, I would suggest it readily to those who are fans of John Green's Looking for Alaska. Like that already-popular novel, Jellicoe Road addresses boundaries (perhaps more literally) and finding oneself, as well as coping with losses and finding meaning in others. Additionally, the more I read, the more Narnie reminded me of Melinda Sorvino in Laurie Halse Anderson's novel Speak. I was relieved to see that like Melinda, Narnie pulled herself together when crisis dictated that need.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["young-adult", "great-ya", "vomit-less-romance", "mental-illness", "ztlib"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44588536", "review_id": "44588536", "date": "Jan 27, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Chelsea", "user_url": "/user/show/122606-chelsea", "text": "This review is going to sound just like all the other reviews on Goodreads for this book, because they're all exactly right.It's a slow and confusing start: push through.It's frustrating, because Marchetta makes you work for every piece of information: it's worth it.It's an incredibly satisfying ending, even if you still haven't quite worked out all the details: yep, you're probably going to want to reread this one.I had put off reading this one because I thought it couldn't possibly live up to the hype - and it didn't, really. The hype was pretty impossible to live up to. But it's an incredibly well written book, full of complicated characters, with a story that will grip you before you ever figure out what's going on.(I ended up reading this in one sleepy go, trying to stay awake all night at the train station - turns out that when they say the train leaves at 11:20, they mean it.

Since I technically knew who everyone was this time around, and knew how the pieces came together, I think it was actually a better read this time around, because I caught more of the hints and details that I missed initially.

But not every will love this book. I will also preface this review by saying that you shouldn't decide whether you belong in group A or group B before you get to page 125 or so. The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial \"wars\" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

It kept me up waaay past my bedtime last night. Marchetta's book--simply titled Jellicoe Road on my hardcover--recently won the Printz Award for best Young Adult book of 2008, so I read it to see why. The story that starts the book, about kids who lose their parents in a terrible car accident and bond with their rescuer, another kid, plus a second new friend, turns out to be a kind of framing device, or maybe a prequel, woven through the current story of Taylor Markham. Taylor lives at the Jellicoe School, and she's the new leader of the school crowd. Together with two other groups--the Townies and the Cadets--the teens fight silent, sometimes vicious battles for territory, all without any of the adults knowing. But mysteries abound: Why has kind neighbor Hannah disappeared? Is the Brigadier a hero or a villain? What did the Hermit say to Taylor right before he killed himself? What happened to Webb? And why did Cadet leader Jonah Griggs call the school after he and Taylor ran away three years ago? Most important, who is Taylor Markham, and can she overcome her own darkness, let alone the darkness of the territory wars? The unwinding of all these mysteries makes for a painfully rich read. If I take a big step back, I might say that all of the tangled subplots in Jellicoe Road are kind of melodramatic. But I can't take that step back, and I don't want to--I'm too busy caring about Taylor and her friends.

It is Australian Melina Marchetta's third book and the first of hers I've read. A fault that will have to be remedied quickly as I absolutely loved this knotty, painful, beautiful book. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School--a backwoods boarding school located somewhere in Australia. Abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, Taylor was taken in by a mysterious woman named Hannah and installed at the school. Now eighteen, Taylor is embroiled in turf wars between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets. But when Hannah up and leaves without a word, Taylor is convinced it has something to do with her mother and with a horrific accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road twenty-two years before. Past and present become harder to discern as the story unfolds. Simultaneously obsessed with and terrified of finding out what happened and just how closely it is tied to her own fragmented life, Taylor is forced to form alliances with the leaders of her rival gangs, including Cadet leader Jonah Griggs with whom she shares a confusing and painful history. This story grabbed me by the throat and shook me until I begged for mercy. Parts of it read almost stream of consciousness and you have to just let it wash over you as characters and histories distill and become clearer on the page and in your mind at about the same pace they do for Taylor herself. And by the time the wars really begin, you are so invested it's impossible to extricate yourself from the world Marchetta has created. Fortunately you don't want to. I was charmed by the dust and heat of the Australian summer, the layered language with its overtones of fear and longing, and the periodic chapters detailing the story of five children who were determined to survive after the world ended.

After reading and hearing accolades about this book, I'm so thrilled to say that I loved it. So beautiful, strange, and heart-wrenching. Excellent teen literature and one of the best books I've read in awhile. Taylor Markham is 11 years old when her mother leaves her at a 7-11 on Jellicoe Road in rural Australia and Hannah finds her. Now 17, she's in her last year at the local boarding school, where Hannah is her house's mentor and the closest thing she has had to a mother. The territory wars between her school, the Cadets, and the Townies are about to begin, and the seniors will be choosing a new leader for Jellicoe School. Hardened by her mother's abandonment and her hidden yearning to belong, Taylor is not the popular choice but is chosen nonetheless. But when Hannah disappears and Jonah Griggs, now cadet leader, reenters her life, Taylor is forced to face her mysterious past and her buried emotions if she wants to have a say in her future.  That synopsis only skims the surface of this complex and multi-faceted novel. There's so much more which is best left to be anticipated. I don't think any summary of Jellicoe Road and its unique premise can really do it justice without including spoilers. I came into it knowing that it may be confusing and hard to sink your teeth into. But being aware of this only made it seem less cumbersome and more promising because I had so much faith that the slow, gradual build-up would be worth it. I did need to re-read several passages as I went along and I know that I still missed some dropped hints, but it was more than worth it. I was awestruck at how the seemingly disparate narrative pieces and disconnected cast of characters all subtly fell into place at the turn of each page until the very last. I'll have to take back some of the times I've said this or that book had a perfect ending, because this one was truly perfect in the way it ties up the story and rewards its reader. I cried and relished it. As a side note writers take note: Marchetta's prologue and epilogue are stellar. I will with pleasure be re-reading this book.

Each book tends to deal with difficult issues surrounding teens that take my breath away and never fail to get me thinking. 2009's choice is no light-weight either. I've actually had \"Jellicoe Road\" in my TBR pile for several months now and just haven't had a chance to pick it up. Now that I've finished it, I'm just kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School, where many of the students, like her, are orphans or have been abandoned by their parents. Taylor was brought to Jellicoe School by the mysterious Hannah after her mom left her at a 7-11 when she was 11. Each year, the students fight the Cadets, who camp near the school for several weeks and the Townies in a type of territory 'war' that determines control over various trails, streams and buildings in the bush. This year, Taylor has been selected as the school's leader and is more than reticent to participate. Then Hannah unexpectedly disappears and Taylor knows it's connected to the disappearance of her mother and will stop at nothing to find out more. Joined by other students, the mysterious Cadet leader Jonah Griggs, and the Townie Santangelo, Taylor slowly unravels the story of her past and the stories of those she loves most.To be competely honest, for the first part of the book I was pretty lost. There are several storylines and everyone seemed to have 'history' which made for some confusing reading. But knowing how many people have raved about it, I just kept reading hoping to make sense of it all. And it did. Taylor's story came together with such unexpected beauty that I found myself totally intrigued by each new revelation and it's effect on Taylor and her friends. That's not to say I missed some things along the way - I actually had to reread several parts after finishing becuase I totally missed one major revelation. Oops. But I can't say enough good about this book: there is such heartbreaking sadness, wonder and hope found here that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

While she can be assertive and brash, she is also often sullen and withdrawn. She has just been appointed leader of her school's campaign in the annual \"Territory Wars\" between the Jellicoe School, the Townies who go to school in town, and the Cadets, whose military school camps out in the bush near the Jellicoe Road to do training exercises. The Territory Wars are kind of a hassle, really, but they can't be dismissed, for they determine who can go where, and they're a tradition that dates back quite a while. It's all quite stressful for Taylor. It just so happens that the one adult she trusts--the one adult who cares for her, who found her after she had been abandoned by her mother, and who brought her to the Jellicoe School in the first place--just disappears one day, and does not leave Taylor with any readon for why she's left Jellicoe nor where she's gone. So Taylor is in a rather unsettled state, a state not particularly conducive to leading her school in the Territory Wars nor negotiating with the leaders of the Townies and Cadets.The Territory Wars are all quite interesting, and they seem uniquely Australian, or maybe they're just unique, but ultimately the book is not about them. Taylor, who knows very little about her past (and what she does know is repressed), starts to piece together a narrative that explains who her parents were, how she came to be abandoned, and the backstory which led to the creation of the Territory Wars. This is a fantastic book. There's a lot of tragedy in this story. But ultimately there's a lot of love, too. Reading this book will make you appreciate your family just a little bit more than you already do. You'll want to go back and look at photos of your parents when they were teenagers. You'll think about all your relatives' stories about their adventures growing up. I loved this book. Terrific writing and terrific story.

Using a sentence from the book that sums up this story, for me: \"I remember love.\" Too simple? It's powerful, multi-faceted and complex, actually, just like love... and life... is. I was swept away on the journey with Taylor and the others, and I cried for what they lost and found. In the end, out of the tragedies and hardships of life, I was left with a feeling of love, hope and wonder, that I, along with the characters, discovered... on the Jellicoe Road. LOVED it! Granted, it was a bit confusing in the beginning, with the story shifting between a different cast of characters, at different times. But then, the pieces started falling into place and once I reached the end, I just thought, with tears in my eyes and my heart overflowing: \"What an amazing story!\" I won't go into the plot as this is a story that one just has to discover in all its layers and complexities as it unfolds. Melina Marchetta, an Aussie author and former teacher, is one of my favourite YA authors. Her characters feel so real and the emotions she portrays are so genuine and raw that her books are all special to me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and totally deserving of all the YA literature awards it won, in my humble opinion!\nOn the Jellicoe Road\n has one of the most powerful (and tragic) openings I have ever read:\"My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?\u201d and my father said, \u201cNarnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn\u2019t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead \u2013 just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, \u201cDidn\u2019t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?\u201dDid I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they\u2019re some kind of garbage, don\u2019t you know?Wonder dies.\"*sniffles*Favourite quotes (Non-Spoiler):\"When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already.\" \"\"What do you want from me?\" he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\"\"He stops and looks at me. \"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\"\"\"My body becomes a raft and there's this part of me that wants just literally to go with the flow. To close my eyes and let it take me. But I know sooner or later I will have to get out, that I need to feel the earth beneath my feet, between my toes - the splinters, the bindi-eyes, the burning sensation of hot dirt, the sting of cuts, the twigs, the bites, the heat, the discomfort, the everything. I need desperately to feel it all, so when something wonderful happens, the contrast will be so massive that I will bottle the impact and keep it for the rest of my life.\" \"Hold my hand because I might disappear.\" \u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d \"It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.\" COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER: I do not hold the copyright to any of the images used in this review.

It\u2019s also the most rewarding. After being held hostage by the king of all hooks in the prologue (\u201cMy father took 132 minutes to die. I counted...\u201d), I expected the plot to unfold quickly thereafter. Instead, the mysterious plot slowly inched forward by cleverly moving backward. This story shares the lives of a group of downtrodden, neglected teenagers \u2013 many wards of the state \u2013 attending the Jellicoe School out in the \u201cboondocks.\u201d Since so few have parents in their lives, they come to depend highly on one another. Teenagers in the town have created territories and proclaimed war against opposing groups. In addition to dealing with territory disputes, seized hostages and keeping the girls of her house safe, Taylor Markham is struggling to contain the demons of her miserable past, unstable present and unpredictable future. At seemingly every turn, she finds battles to fight, drama to tame and an unlikely romance to decipher. But Taylor\u2019s biggest distraction is trying to solve the painful mysteries of her past. Melina Marchetta has written an absolute masterpiece. Appreciating this story requires an extremely patient reader who is willing to reread confusing parts several times over. Marchetta challenges her readers to make higher-level connections most authors wouldn\u2019t dare try in fear of losing their readers too soon. You may find yourself completely lost 200 and even 300 pages into this story but stick it out to the end. The book is like a puzzle with 419 pieces. Each piece of the page (i.e., each page) must be carefully considered and pieced together in the correct context in order to be fully understood. As you make it toward the end of the book, you will recall scenes throughout the story that previously had you wondering, \u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201d and you will say aloud, \u201cOooohhh!! I get it now. WOW!\u201d When, late in the story, the author began dropping subtle clues to make sense of earlier scenes, my eyes continually widened and my jaw constantly dropped - and my heart even pounded at times! Once completed, you will experience a moving story that will force you to break out the tissues and to applaud Marchetta\u2019s brilliant storytelling. Jellicoe Road is oftentimes devastating, sometimes humorous and steadily mysterious. It is an intricate, complicated story that could easily be used as part of a college-level literature course. I decided to read the book because I came across Jellicoe Road as I was trying to find good books to read on Goodreads. I noticed Jellicoe Road scored a high rating on Goodreads, so I gave it a try. While a select handful of 8th graders might be able to tackle and interpret this story, I would recommend this story mainly for advanced avid readers, high school and above.

There are so many things going on in this book it was hard to keep them straight. There is Taylor Markham, abandoned by her mother when she was 11, her father has never been around and she doesn't know why, her guardian Hannah has left town without telling her, a boy from her past is back in town and getting under her skin. Then there are the territory wars between the townies, the cadets and the students of the Jellico school, a boarding school of which she is their reluctant leader.And then there is the back story which pops up intermitently throughout the book about 5 kids who lived on the Jellicoe Road over 20 years ago, 3 of whom were involved in a terrible accident that killed 5 people. This part confused me at first because I could not figure out how the story of those 5 kids had any relevance at all to the present situation and I kept feeling like I was missing some crucial plot element, but when the pieces start to fall together like pieces in a puzzle it is so worth the wait. Each detail of this story has some relevance and each piece that falls into place is like a revelation. Once things start to come together I had a hard time putting it down and am still thinking about even now.Ultimately this is a book about a girl who is desperate to put together the pieces of her past and find where she belongs. It is a heartbreaking story and yet it is also one of hope and love.There are definitely undertones of some mature subject matter; death, drug addiction, abuse, suicide, and a brief sex scene so I would not recommend it to younger readers or anyone really who would be bothered by that, but definitely a story that made an impression on me.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51336040", "review_id": "51336040", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Heather Zenzen", "user_url": "/user/show/939330-heather-zenzen", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51337892", "review_id": "51337892", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Jane", "user_url": "/user/show/1901499-jane", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51340285", "review_id": "51340285", "date": "Apr 02, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Suey", "user_url": "/user/show/1049883-suey", "text": "I loved this one.

Failing that, I was certain that after nabbing a National Book Award, What I Saw and How I Lied (2008) would take a Printz award/honor.You can therefore imagine my surprise when it was neither of my predicted titles but Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road* (2008**) that won the 2009 Printz Award for excellence in young adult literature. Being a fan of Marchetta's previous novels Looking for Alibrandi (1992) and especially Saving Francesca (2005) you can also imagine my embarrassment upon realizing one of my favorite authors had published a new book without my realizing it.The only solution, of course, was to immediately procure a copy from the library and read it as soon as possible.Jellicoe Road is not a novel with one protagonist. Rather, it has many. The story starts on the Jellicoe Road with a tragic accident that will have far reaching repercussions for each character in the novel. Then, abruptly, the story starts again twenty-two years later at the Jellicoe School--the boarding school located farther down the same road--when Taylor Markham is chosen to lead the school's faction in a secret territory war that has spanned a generation between the school boarders, the Townies, and the Cadets.The Jellicoe School is the only real home Taylor has ever known. She has been at the school since she was eleven, when her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road and Hannah drove by to pick Taylor up and take her to the school. Now seventeen, Taylor is in many ways still a young girl afraid of being abandoned by those she loves. Which is why, at the start of the story, Taylor balks at the authority thrust upon her and the relationships it will necessitate. Leading the Jellicoe School through the territory wars is bad enough, but being in charge of an entire dorm of students seems truly unbearable. Taylor's resolve to live a life apart is tested, and in many ways broken, with the efforts of well-meaning friends and the appearance of Jonah Griggs--the one person Taylor never expected to see, or need, ever again.As the territory wars escalate, Taylor's life is thrown into disarray with the sudden disappearance of Hannah--the only adult Taylor would come close to calling family. With Hannah gone, Taylor begins reading Hannah's unfinished novel for lack of anything else to cling to. Marchetta weaves Taylor's story and the events of Hannah's novel and even the histories of other characters together to create one haunting narrative where, the more Taylor reads, the more it feels like she is looking not at fictitious characters but at people she has known her entire life.While trying to understand Hannah's sudden absence, Taylor also starts to understand herself. Eventually she realizes that living life at a distance offers no protection from abandonment and provides even fewer options to heal scars from past betrayals.The novel starts with rapid fire narration as Taylor throws out events and names at the reader without any frame of reference. Later in the story the importance of the Cadet, the Hermit, and the Brigadier becomes painfully obvious. But in the first pages the narrative comes closer to painfully confusing and unwieldy. By the end of my reading I had a marker at almost every page to indicated important points and favorite passages. However, if you can roll with the uncertainty, you will be rewarded. At a little over four hundred pages, Marchetta still creates a page-turner that moves quickly and weaves together every single narrative thread by the final page.Because Taylor is not forthcoming with explanations, the novel reads like a mystery (fitting since my two Printz Award predictions were also mysteries of sorts). However a good portion of the story is also simply about friendship and love. Taylor expects neither from her time on the Jellicoe Road even though they might be exactly what she was supposed to find there all along. Marchetta blends moments of humor and gravitas in her unique prose style to create another really great read.* Jellicoe Road was actually originally published, I assume in Marchetta's native Australia, with the title On the Jellicoe Road. For various reasons, upon finishing the novel, I feel that this title is superior to the American edition's shortened version.** The book was originally published, again I assume in Australia, in 2006.*** In addition to the original title being superior, in terms of relevance to the story, the original cover art is also much more apt. (Although I just realized the US cover has a Poppy on it which I will grudgingly admit is actually pretty relevant to the story. It also makes it impossible to pick a cover to feature here so, readers, you get both.)", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["owned"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51573534", "review_id": "51573534", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Blyth", "user_url": "/user/show/107824-blyth", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51591315", "review_id": "51591315", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "SS", "user_url": "/user/show/1995632-ss", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51598698", "review_id": "51598698", "date": "", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Jessica", "user_url": "/user/show/1146723-jessica", "text": "", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51622802", "review_id": "51622802", "date": "Apr 05, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Kelly Holmes", "user_url": "/user/show/1924514-kelly-holmes", "text": "Summary: At a boarding school in the Australian bush country, Taylor Markham has been selected as the reluctant leader to represent the school in negotiations with their rivals, the Townies and the Cadets.

I had never even heard of the book when it won, but I moved it to the top of my \"to read\" list. I only finished the book because a fellow librarian told me \"keep going, it's worth it.\" Most books that have a hook like this one, \"My father took 132 minutes to die. I counted,\" keep you hooked, but the marvel of this book is in my ever changing experience as a reader. One page one I was hooked (if not a little disturbed by the subject matter). By page fifty I was bored and confused. By page 100 I was ready to put it down. Thank goodness I didn't. By page 150 I was reeling through it enraptured and excited as I connected the dots and the puzzle pieces slowly came into place. This book is a moving depiction of two generations as their lives run in near parallel. Taylor Markham discovers the truths she either never knew or didn't remember and comes to realizations about love and relationships. It sounds cheesy and cliche when I put it that way, but really the book is anything but cheesy and cliched. It's a bit hard to put your finger on and I don't want to give anything away so that the puzzle can come together for you, too. I can tell you that you'll find a teenage girl frantically grappling with the past, a relationship fueled as much by dislike as it is by a sense of connectedness and longing, a territory war among three factions and a patch of poppies along the side of the most beautiful road you'll ever see, Jellicoe Road.
