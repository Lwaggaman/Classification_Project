Taylor has always been full of questions: about her mother's whereabouts and about her father, and about what role Hannah plays into it all.But now she's seventeen, as far away from answers as ever, and with the responsibility of leading the boarders in the territory wars between them and the cadets and the townies. And then Hannah leaves under mysterious circumstances, leaving behind a bad tempered cat and a manuscript telling the story of five kids who lived on the Jellicoe Road some twenty years before.Without Hannah, Taylor is more lost than ever, and the fact that Jonah Griggs is back doesn't help matters at all. Second Glance: I've read Jellicoe Road before, I even reviewed it once before. But this time I decided to listen to the Audiobook of it when I came across the australian edition - something I hadn't done before - and while the story remained the same, it was a very different experience. I liked hearing the voices of Taylor, Jonah, Chaz and Raffy, and everyone else, I thought the narrator - Rebecca Macauley - did a good job of it, making different voices for everyone and her guy-voices were pretty good. Also, I noticed stuff about the characters that I hadn't before, like that Taylor was a bit of a Drama Queen, something that I had never noticed before. On the down side, the musical transitions between chapters and between past and present were too long and they got kind of annoying after a while. Bottom Line: Jellicoe Road remains one of my favorite books ever and I liked the Audiobook, but I still think I like the reading experience a bit better.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["teen-ya", "rainy-day-reads", "favorite-authors", "contemporary", "favorites", "lived-up-to-the-hype", "aussie", "tearjearker"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/23726222", "review_id": "23726222", "date": "Jun 04, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Steph (Reviewer X)", "user_url": "/user/show/1169804-steph-reviewer-x", "text": "Cross posted from my \nblog review\n.This is one of those books that 1) you should go into not knowing much of anything, 2) that will probably leave you very confused for the first 100 pages or so, but 3) is ultimately one you\u2019ll end up loving, or at the very least appreciating the cleverness behind the structure. Preferably you\u2019ll have read one of Melina\u2019s other books before (and if we\u2019re speaking of \u201cpreferably,\u201d that book will have been Looking for Alibrandi, because I think it\u2019s better than Saving Francesca), so you\u2019ll know Melina\u2019s a fine writer who knows what she\u2019s doing and isn\u2019t just getting sloppy.It\u2019s hard to say what Jellicoe Road is about exactly\u2014I don\u2019t want your reading experience to be ruined. And anyway, even if I did tell you what it\u2019s about, this novel has so many facets, it\u2019s hard to give a full picture without making you sit down and read it. It\u2019s a mystery novel about finding yourself; it\u2019s a family story about a girl who is, for all intents and purposes, an orphan; it\u2019s a story about friendship for a girl who always thought she was alone; and it\u2019s about a road that, immobile as it is, is constantly changing to the eye of each beholder. It\u2019s no wonder this novel is so confusing at first\u2014it\u2019s a paradox of itself.Anyway, as I was saying in the beginning, this book\u2019s different, in structure as much as plot. There are two main storylines, one from the past\u2014seventeen years before\u2014and one in the present. The Past one tells the story of five teenagers who were friends, family, and couples, all of whom had special ties to the Jellicoe Road. The Present one tells the story of one lone teenage girl who\u2019s been abandoned by her mother, who\u2019s got no recollection of her father, and who has no other family to speak of. The Present is told in real time through Taylor\u2019s first person narration; the Past is told through manuscript pages written by a woman who\u2019s been like a mother\u2014but not really a mother\u2014to Taylor ever since she was abandoned. The book basically keeps going with each storyline until both merge and you see how they\u2019re connected.Like I said: this isn\u2019t a book I\u2019ve\u2014or you\u2019ve, I\u2019d wager\u2014read before. It\u2019s original and elusive, and, when all is said and done, brilliant. It kept me at bay, grasping for clues where there just weren\u2019t any until everything made sense in a way I wouldn\u2019t have guessed.I\u2019d like to say there\u2019s a bit in here for everyone. You\u2019ve got your romance, your twisting-and-turning plot, your poetic prose, your instant solid characters, and your underlying passionate and solid storytelling.Possibly on my list of favorite YA books ever, probably my favorite Melina Marchetta, and definitely on my top ten for this year (US release date, of course).

Only moments later a woman by the name of Hannah picked her up and brought her to the Jellicoe School. Now she is seventeen and finds that Hannah is a rock in her inconsistent life. While she has Hannah, Taylor doesn't know much about her family except the horror stories she remembers of her mother. She does find comfort though in a manuscript that Hannah has written about a group of five friends who met in the worst circumstances, but delved a remarkable friendship when they only had each other. When Hannah just up and leaves, Taylor doesn't understand what has happened and she becomes a wreck. Not only does she have to deal with Hannah's disappearance, but she has just been named the head of her House and the leader of the school kids in the annual territory wars against the \"Townies\" and \"Cadets.\" In the war the three groups battle and negotiate following an extensive set of rules that might as well be history. As the war wages on Taylor learns to take an active role in her community as well as develop relationships that she never thought possible. Especially with Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets whom she already has quite a history with already. This war will be like no other. It will not only be between the normal three parties, but among friends, hearts desires, and most of all Taylor herself.From the title I was expecting a light and fun read. Wow, was I wrong. This book is filled with heartbreak, joy, laughter and sorrow. It completely blew me away and surpassed every expectation I had, even though I was expecting something completely different. Before I even get into the elements of the story I have to comment on how much talent the author has. Melina Marhetta's writing style is indescribable. It seemed that she was so comfortable writing the story and her words just flowed from page to page with great clarity. I loved how the author weaved many intricate details and mini-stories into one big story, making it like a puzzle that slowly comes together until those last couple of pieces which just fall into place. The only miff I had with this book is that it took me probably until the third chapter to actually understand what was going on. In the beginning there were two stories going on and it was hard to wrap my head around everything that was happening. After that though it seemed the author settled into writing and the story took off. Taylor without a doubt is one of the best characters that I think has ever been created. She has this true voice where you can hear and feel her emotion ring out. By the time the book had ended I felt like I knew Taylor like I know my best friends. While Taylor was the main character, the author did a fabulous job creating the other characters. Unlike many supporting characters, the characters in Jellicoe Road all had their own voices and became their own person with a real and likable personality. I highly recommend this book to readers everywhere. Whether you're a girl or a guy, you will treasure this novel and hold it near and dear to your heart for a long time to come. Jellicoe Road is a beautiful love story, a heart wrenching story of loss, a poignant self-discovery, and most of all an unforgettable tale. It is by far one of the best books of the year.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/24632682", "review_id": "24632682", "date": "Jun 16, 2008", "rating": 5, "user_name": "book_nymph_bex", "user_url": "/user/show/949883-book-nymph-bex", "text": "I got this book as an ARC through HarperCollins and I loved it!

I still love it but that honor has been replaced by Melina's most recent book \"Finnikin of the Rock\". In any case, Jellicoe Road is fantastic and a book I will cherish for a long time to come.Taylor and Jonah's relationship is INTENSE. In addition to being leaders of opposing teams in the turf war, they have history. Oh, and what a history. They met 3 years earlier and spent a few days together. These few days transformed each of their lives. The beginning of their relationship consisted of each being utterly vulnerable to one another. Even though they didn't see each other or talk in the years that followed, they couldn't possibly forget each other and what happened between them. This history makes their present day interactions heated and explosive. Despite this, there is a tenderness between them that is, at first, so subtle. You see it building through the course of the book into a love that is convincingly true. Actually, you get to see how they fell in love with each other twice, once at age 14 and then presently -- with the first fueling the second. Each of them is fiercely independent and, due to misunderstandings from their earlier history, they are so cold to each other when they meet again in the present. Reading about their relationship conjures up the image of an iceberg melting into warm, soothing spring water. You get to see how these initially strong, negative reactions to one other transform into very strong, loving, self-sacrificing openness to one another. As individuals, they each carry around so much pain. At their best, they are able to offer solace to one another in a way no else can.

It's only appropriate, really, for the beginning to confuse us, since Taylor is sort of lost herself. Since she is telling us the story as she struggles with her role at school, her missing mother, the disappearance of a favorite adult, and needy peers, we see her frustrated state of mind. There are intriguing hints of a story that took place a generation before, and slowly the two stories connect. The ending is an unexpectedly forceful tearjerker, with happy and painful moments crushed together. At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start.

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \"What's the difference between a trip and a journey?\" and my father said, \"Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,\" and that was the last thing he ever said. We heard her almost straightaway. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead--just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives. Someone asked us later, \"Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?\" Did I wonder? When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of garbage, don't you know? Wonder dies.Powerful, isn't it? I won't lie...Jellicoe Road is a difficult read in many different ways. But worth it? Yes! Resoundingly yes! Why is it difficult? It weaves two stories together. The stories are seemingly unconnected...at least in the beginning. And because you--the reader--don't know what is going on...it's easy to get frustrated. Easy to get confused. We've got the past--from which the prologue serves as an introduction--and the present. (In a way it reminds me of Tamar.)The present. We've got several teens whose lives intersect--Taylor Markham, Ben Cassidy, Jonah Griggs, Chaz Santangelo, Raffaela, Jessa McKenzie--of whom Taylor is the main character. Taylor doesn't know where she fits in, \"One day when I was eleven, my mother drove me out here and while I was in the toilets at the 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, she drove off and left me there. It becomes one of those defining moments in your life, when your mother does that. It's not as if I don't forgive her, because I do\" (20). Taylor is one of many students at Jellicoe School, a boarding school; she's the leader of her dorm or \"house\". (There are six houses.) And the school tradition is that there are \"wars\" between three sects--those that live at the boarding school (led by Taylor), the Townies (led by Chaz Santangelo), and the Cadets (led by Jonah Griggs). These wars involve territories. And these games last six weeks or so. And they're a big deal for those involved. But what at first seems like a senseless, pointless book on children playing war--tactical strategies, trapping, pranking, and such--soon turns into an emotional journey of the heart, soul, and mind.Taylor Markham is concerned, worried, anxious about Hannah, a woman who is the closest thing she has to family, when she disappears without a word. One day she's there, the next day she's gone. And Taylor can't get a straight word out of any of the adults around at the school or in the town about Hannah's whereabouts. Taylor--though Hannah is still missing--likes to take refuge in Hannah's house. She loves to read Hannah's manuscript, for example, which is the story of five kids who live on Jellicoe Road: Tate, Narnie, Webb, Fitz, and Jude.I don't want to spoil this one in any way. But I think this *may* help readers out a bit. I didn't catch on that the italicized portions--the stories of Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, etc.--were written down stories. That Taylor was reading something Hannah had written down. I'm still not sure all of them are meant to be. But I think some of them are. And it is these stories which help Taylor to piece everything all together. (I had assumed that they were flashbacks. That they were there for the reader's benefit, but not for the characters within the book.)This is a book that had to grow on me. It wasn't one that I knew I would love--or thought I would love--from the very first page. But by the time the story comes together, by the finale, it had me completely won over. The story is intricately told and well written. Haunting, yes. Bittersweet, definitely. But one that I think is worth reading and recommending.\u00a9 Becky Laney of Becky's Book Reviews ", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/39556485", "review_id": "39556485", "date": "Dec 07, 2008", "rating": 1, "user_name": "Kristin", "user_url": "/user/show/85084-kristin", "text": "Maybe it's because I don't really like the reader on the audiobook version of this that I was going through, but I am not really a fan of this book.

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me.

It took a good \u00bc to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I\u2019m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn\u2019t be rereading this book in the near future, about \u00be the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy. Given how much pleasure I got from reading it, perhaps I\u2019m wrong and perhaps just the right amount of content was included.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years.

I am a sucker for braided narratives; they read like a mystery novel for me. This was a great one. I found myself jotting notes to try to figure out how the plot lines connected long before it was evident there was much of a connection. I think that once students get into it (it does take a while for some, although I was instantly hooked) they will feel the same and try to think about how it will fit as well.So, assuming that not all teens are as into that aspect as I am, why else would this appeal to students? The novel begins with a brutal accident, one that can't help but make you root for the children who were left behind. On the other hand, the book is full of the closest types of friendships forming... The kinds of friendships that become family, whether out of need (as is shown here) or just because everyone needs that kind of bond. High school students are beginning to experience that, and to see groups of peers so passionate about friendship is something everyone can relate to... even if it's just something they have always wanted.However, I quickly learned that not everyone was as invested in reading this book as I was. Many of my classmates found the first hundred or so pages to be very confusing and therefore lost interest. For this reason, I would only really recommend it to students who love to read already. In addition, the \"war\" seems really pointless. Yes, it is explained later in the novel, but it actually makes most reviews sound like it's a science fiction novel or something, and it isn't at all. I think that this plot device, and the scant purpose for it, would distract and annoy many readers.The biggest asset to the best young adult literature is a believable cast of characters, and Marchetta is a little bit hit-or-miss on this one. Some, such as Taylor & Hannah, are incredibly believable. On the other hand, because so little is really known about all of the older cast of characters (particularly Fritz and Jude), these sometimes come off as flat characters, barely more than cardboard stand-ins.To encourage students to read this novel, I would suggest it readily to those who are fans of John Green's Looking for Alaska. Like that already-popular novel, Jellicoe Road addresses boundaries (perhaps more literally) and finding oneself, as well as coping with losses and finding meaning in others.

Taylor Markham, age seventeen, is the leader of a house of girls at a boarding school in Austrailia. Each Summer, the boarding school kids participate in territory wars with the Cadets (Summer camp attendees from the military academy in Sydney) and the Townies (kids from the local town.) The novel begins with a flash-back that grabs the reader\u2019s attention immediately, however, when chapter 1 begins it is slightly disorienting and it takes a few pages for the reader to orient themselves in the world of Taylor. There is a mystery embedded in the narrative that may initially cause confusion among readers, but those who stick with the storyline will be highly rewarded. I personally had a hard time wanting to stay with the story but I loved how it all came together. This title won the Michael L. Printz award for 2009.

The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial \"wars\" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

The book deals with the following developmental markers: surviving on your own/becoming independent, reconciling with your past, developing positive adult relationships, forgiveness, and understanding. I thought that the characters were believable. Taylor really appealed to me and drew me into the story. I wanted her to do well and succeed. I also liked the relationships amongst the characters; I thought they were realistic and believable. I was a bit doubtful that there would really be \u201cterritory wars\u201d as described in the book, but upon understanding the history behind their creation, I can see how that would really happen too. In a sense, Taylor\u2019s experiences could be a representation for the types of conflict that occur on a much larger scale around the world. I would promote this book in conjunction with other similarly themed novels: The Outsiders, Miracle\u2019s Boys, or Westside Story, etc. I think that describing the basic plot and the way in which Marchetta has established the plot structure would be enough to entice a reader to want to pick the book up.

The first chapter left me awestruck- it was an incredible beginning. However, the next 100 pages are comprised of two stories that swirl around one main character who frankly, is less than likable in the beginning. After the 200 page mark, it is apparent that the structure emulates the main character's confusion- the reader is already beginning to piece together what the main character is beginning to suspect. It is tedious work, but the payoff is worth it- once the story picks up and the characters begin to interact, the story is quite enjoyable. I took off one star for two reasons. One is due to editing. I felt that structurally, the reader could relate to the main story of Jellicoe Road, but the reader never really relates to the secondary story. With as many pages and development allocated by the writer, there should have been more development or in my opinion, less of the secondary story except in the development of the main story (I'm trying to write this without spoiling anything here). There are also some basic mistakes, as noted in other reviews- the ethnicity of one character contradicts itself, there are unexplained lapses in time during scenes, and so on.Finally, this is supposed to be an award-winning book, with an emphasis on literary achievement. While Jellicoe Road does not lack this, I personally see this book as having a rather limited teen audience. I work in a public library, and there is a certain type of teen who would be willing to put in the effort to navigate the complexities of this novel- a novel that is sometimes overly complex and at times somewhat inaccessible. I worked through the first third of the book because it was a Printz winner, and I felt an obligation to finish it. I wonder if teens would do the same- it's not difficult, but it can be a chore.

The story that starts the book, about kids who lose their parents in a terrible car accident and bond with their rescuer, another kid, plus a second new friend, turns out to be a kind of framing device, or maybe a prequel, woven through the current story of Taylor Markham. Taylor lives at the Jellicoe School, and she's the new leader of the school crowd. Together with two other groups--the Townies and the Cadets--the teens fight silent, sometimes vicious battles for territory, all without any of the adults knowing. But mysteries abound: Why has kind neighbor Hannah disappeared? Is the Brigadier a hero or a villain? What did the Hermit say to Taylor right before he killed himself? What happened to Webb? And why did Cadet leader Jonah Griggs call the school after he and Taylor ran away three years ago? Most important, who is Taylor Markham, and can she overcome her own darkness, let alone the darkness of the territory wars? The unwinding of all these mysteries makes for a painfully rich read. If I take a big step back, I might say that all of the tangled subplots in Jellicoe Road are kind of melodramatic. But I can't take that step back, and I don't want to--I'm too busy caring about Taylor and her friends.

It is Australian Melina Marchetta's third book and the first of hers I've read. A fault that will have to be remedied quickly as I absolutely loved this knotty, painful, beautiful book. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School--a backwoods boarding school located somewhere in Australia. Abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, Taylor was taken in by a mysterious woman named Hannah and installed at the school. Now eighteen, Taylor is embroiled in turf wars between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets. But when Hannah up and leaves without a word, Taylor is convinced it has something to do with her mother and with a horrific accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road twenty-two years before. Past and present become harder to discern as the story unfolds. Simultaneously obsessed with and terrified of finding out what happened and just how closely it is tied to her own fragmented life, Taylor is forced to form alliances with the leaders of her rival gangs, including Cadet leader Jonah Griggs with whom she shares a confusing and painful history. This story grabbed me by the throat and shook me until I begged for mercy. Parts of it read almost stream of consciousness and you have to just let it wash over you as characters and histories distill and become clearer on the page and in your mind at about the same pace they do for Taylor herself. And by the time the wars really begin, you are so invested it's impossible to extricate yourself from the world Marchetta has created. Fortunately you don't want to. I was charmed by the dust and heat of the Australian summer, the layered language with its overtones of fear and longing, and the periodic chapters detailing the story of five children who were determined to survive after the world ended.

After reading and hearing accolades about this book, I'm so thrilled to say that I loved it. So beautiful, strange, and heart-wrenching. Excellent teen literature and one of the best books I've read in awhile. Taylor Markham is 11 years old when her mother leaves her at a 7-11 on Jellicoe Road in rural Australia and Hannah finds her. Now 17, she's in her last year at the local boarding school, where Hannah is her house's mentor and the closest thing she has had to a mother. The territory wars between her school, the Cadets, and the Townies are about to begin, and the seniors will be choosing a new leader for Jellicoe School. Hardened by her mother's abandonment and her hidden yearning to belong, Taylor is not the popular choice but is chosen nonetheless. But when Hannah disappears and Jonah Griggs, now cadet leader, reenters her life, Taylor is forced to face her mysterious past and her buried emotions if she wants to have a say in her future.  That synopsis only skims the surface of this complex and multi-faceted novel. There's so much more which is best left to be anticipated. I don't think any summary of Jellicoe Road and its unique premise can really do it justice without including spoilers. I came into it knowing that it may be confusing and hard to sink your teeth into. But being aware of this only made it seem less cumbersome and more promising because I had so much faith that the slow, gradual build-up would be worth it. I did need to re-read several passages as I went along and I know that I still missed some dropped hints, but it was more than worth it. I was awestruck at how the seemingly disparate narrative pieces and disconnected cast of characters all subtly fell into place at the turn of each page until the very last. I'll have to take back some of the times I've said this or that book had a perfect ending, because this one was truly perfect in the way it ties up the story and rewards its reader. I cried and relished it. As a side note writers take note: Marchetta's prologue and epilogue are stellar. I will with pleasure be re-reading this book.

In the past they have chosen some truly aMAZing books (like \"The White Darkness\" or \"Looking for Alaska\") some not so much my favorites but still, they always choose books just a little bit different, which is what I really like. Each book tends to deal with difficult issues surrounding teens that take my breath away and never fail to get me thinking. 2009's choice is no light-weight either. I've actually had \"Jellicoe Road\" in my TBR pile for several months now and just haven't had a chance to pick it up. Now that I've finished it, I'm just kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School, where many of the students, like her, are orphans or have been abandoned by their parents. Taylor was brought to Jellicoe School by the mysterious Hannah after her mom left her at a 7-11 when she was 11. Each year, the students fight the Cadets, who camp near the school for several weeks and the Townies in a type of territory 'war' that determines control over various trails, streams and buildings in the bush. This year, Taylor has been selected as the school's leader and is more than reticent to participate. Then Hannah unexpectedly disappears and Taylor knows it's connected to the disappearance of her mother and will stop at nothing to find out more. Joined by other students, the mysterious Cadet leader Jonah Griggs, and the Townie Santangelo, Taylor slowly unravels the story of her past and the stories of those she loves most.To be competely honest, for the first part of the book I was pretty lost. There are several storylines and everyone seemed to have 'history' which made for some confusing reading. But knowing how many people have raved about it, I just kept reading hoping to make sense of it all. And it did. Taylor's story came together with such unexpected beauty that I found myself totally intrigued by each new revelation and it's effect on Taylor and her friends. That's not to say I missed some things along the way - I actually had to reread several parts after finishing becuase I totally missed one major revelation. Oops. But I can't say enough good about this book: there is such heartbreaking sadness, wonder and hope found here that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

This novel is utterly confusing until you get deep into the plot. Once you really realize that there are two stories being told, Taylor's story of her the time when she meets Jonah and forms a deep relationship, and the second is the story of Webb, Tate, Narnie, Fitz and Jude whose lives are interwoven following a tragic accident on Jellicoe Road. What makes the story difficult to follow is the fact that it isn't written in a chronilogical format. The reader, if in a classroom setting, might benefit from keeping notes on the characters or a timeline of events in each character's life. I didn't realize until late in the story that Taylor would meet her mother again, which is the perfect ending to the most confusing story I've read. Making a family tree visual prior to reading in the classroom, would offer meaning for the reader of the families and the conflict that exists. Marchetta deals with so many themes, it will be a long study for the class who takes on this book. The students or the reader will be forced to think about family relationships and roles. The reader will see many examples of friendships, both good and bad, which will lead to issues of loyalty. I also wanted to know more about the parents of these children. What parenting roles are to be modeled or emulated and what parental roles would we like to broach and forget? Children are often forced, too soon, to deal with the harshness life can offer with death's grief and with the possibility of abandonment by parents for whatever reasons. This would be an incredible book to use in order to study relationships. I would have to recommend that the teacher read it several times so as not to miss the many messages twisted into the plot and to be able to guide the reader through the issues creatively. Not an easy read is Jellicoe Road, but a most challenging and interesting one. Still, it is not one I would just pick up for pleasure, I would have to have encouragement or pressure if I were a student today. These are relevant topics in the game of life that all adolescents should embrace. This book may be very difficult for the suffering kid. It wouldn't be possible for the struggling reader.5Q 3P S", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["printz-award-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47841441", "review_id": "47841441", "date": "Feb 28, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Kate", "user_url": "/user/show/1959608-kate", "text": "I love this book sooooo much!!!!at the beginning was a bit confusing but other than that it was great!!it is one of the best books EVER!!:)", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["favorites"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/47895438", "review_id": "47895438", "date": "Mar 01, 2009", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Eva Mitnick", "user_url": "/user/show/633929-eva-mitnick", "text": "At first I thought this would be another boarding school/war games book - but no, it quickly became a fascinating story about family, friends, and connections, all taking place in a tiny Australian town where three groups of teenagers - students at the state-run boarding school just outside town, kids who live in the town, and the Cadets who use the bush outside the town as a training area during school breaks - skirmish every summer.

While she can be assertive and brash, she is also often sullen and withdrawn. She has just been appointed leader of her school's campaign in the annual \"Territory Wars\" between the Jellicoe School, the Townies who go to school in town, and the Cadets, whose military school camps out in the bush near the Jellicoe Road to do training exercises. The Territory Wars are kind of a hassle, really, but they can't be dismissed, for they determine who can go where, and they're a tradition that dates back quite a while. It's all quite stressful for Taylor. It just so happens that the one adult she trusts--the one adult who cares for her, who found her after she had been abandoned by her mother, and who brought her to the Jellicoe School in the first place--just disappears one day, and does not leave Taylor with any readon for why she's left Jellicoe nor where she's gone. So Taylor is in a rather unsettled state, a state not particularly conducive to leading her school in the Territory Wars nor negotiating with the leaders of the Townies and Cadets.The Territory Wars are all quite interesting, and they seem uniquely Australian, or maybe they're just unique, but ultimately the book is not about them. Taylor, who knows very little about her past (and what she does know is repressed), starts to piece together a narrative that explains who her parents were, how she came to be abandoned, and the backstory which led to the creation of the Territory Wars. This is a fantastic book. There's a lot of tragedy in this story. But ultimately there's a lot of love, too. Reading this book will make you appreciate your family just a little bit more than you already do. You'll want to go back and look at photos of your parents when they were teenagers. You'll think about all your relatives' stories about their adventures growing up. I loved this book. Terrific writing and terrific story.

Well, I did, two times, but the third time\u2026well\u2026wow. Every once in awhile, a book comes along that just hits you in the gut. It hits too close to home, it tears your heart out, it grabs you by the roots of your hair and spins and doesn\u2019t turn loose until well after the last page has been turned. Jellicoe Road did all these things to me and so much more.Taylor Markham has been living at the Jellicoe Road boarding school since her mother abandoned her at the nearby 7-Eleven six years earlier. She doesn\u2019t really know what happened to her father; only that he has been gone for most of her life. Now she\u2019s seventeen has been newly elected to the post of student leader of her dorm and to lead the Underground Community as one of the three boarding schools who battle for territory (among other things) in her small Australian community. The two other gangs are called the Cadets and the Townies. For years these three camps have fought in the \u201cTerritory Wars;\u201d wars fought over land, trees, water, and more. Everything is going swimmingly, until Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family disappears without a word. Jonah Griggs, the boy Taylor ran away with three years ago and the leader of the Cadets has popped back into her life with smoldering looks and mystifying behavior. And all the young kids of Taylor\u2019s house are now looking to her for everything. Things start falling apart.Understandably Taylor wants to know what\u2019s going on with Hannah. We are given glimpses of a novel that Hannah has been working on, which at first Taylor takes to be fictional but quickly realizes that it might not be so fictional. It provides an all important glimpse of Hannah\u2019s, and Taylor\u2019s, life. As she gets closer and closer to the truth the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and, well, good luck putting the book down. This is an absorbing story where nothing is quite what it seems and the clues only lead to more questions for Taylor, as she tries to work out the connections between herself, Hannah, her mother and the character\u2019s in Hannah\u2019s book. This is a book about secrets, anguish, pain, love, betrayal, hope, death, life and oh so much more. It\u2019s heartbreaking and beautiful. It\u2019s gorgeous and haunting. It\u2019s going to live with me for a long time, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m so glad I gave it that third try.Oh and this is important.

Using a sentence from the book that sums up this story, for me: \"I remember love.\" Too simple? It's powerful, multi-faceted and complex, actually, just like love... and life... is. I was swept away on the journey with Taylor and the others, and I cried for what they lost and found. In the end, out of the tragedies and hardships of life, I was left with a feeling of love, hope and wonder, that I, along with the characters, discovered... on the Jellicoe Road. LOVED it! Granted, it was a bit confusing in the beginning, with the story shifting between a different cast of characters, at different times. But then, the pieces started falling into place and once I reached the end, I just thought, with tears in my eyes and my heart overflowing: \"What an amazing story!\" I won't go into the plot as this is a story that one just has to discover in all its layers and complexities as it unfolds. Melina Marchetta, an Aussie author and former teacher, is one of my favourite YA authors. Her characters feel so real and the emotions she portrays are so genuine and raw that her books are all special to me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and totally deserving of all the YA literature awards it won, in my humble opinion!\nOn the Jellicoe Road\n has one of the most powerful (and tragic) openings I have ever read:\"My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I\u2019d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between a trip and a journey?\u201d and my father said, \u201cNarnie, my love, when we get there, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn\u2019t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead \u2013 just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, \u201cDidn\u2019t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?\u201dDid I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they\u2019re some kind of garbage, don\u2019t you know?Wonder dies.\"*sniffles*Favourite quotes (Non-Spoiler):\"When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already.\" \"\"What do you want from me?\" he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.\"\"He stops and looks at me. \"I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.\"\"\"My body becomes a raft and there's this part of me that wants just literally to go with the flow. To close my eyes and let it take me. But I know sooner or later I will have to get out, that I need to feel the earth beneath my feet, between my toes - the splinters, the bindi-eyes, the burning sensation of hot dirt, the sting of cuts, the twigs, the bites, the heat, the discomfort, the everything. I need desperately to feel it all, so when something wonderful happens, the contrast will be so massive that I will bottle the impact and keep it for the rest of my life.\" \"Hold my hand because I might disappear.\" \u201cIs a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?\u201d \"It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you.

There are two different sets of characters, one group from the past, and a contemporary one, with no clues as to how they fit together, complicated by the fact that the characters' names are Australian and not obvious (at least to this American) which ones belong to boys, and which ones to girls. You learn right off that there was a car accident that brought five kids together in the past, and that there's a girl named Taylor trying to figure out what they have to do with her now. Fortunately, the plot is strong enough and rewarding enough to be worth it. I got to the end, and just as many other reviewers have said, immediately started again from the beginning.The main character is Taylor, a GIRL, and a student at the boarding school on Jellicoe Road. She's almost an orphan, and lives there year-round, since her mother left her at the age of nine. But Taylor knows there's a lot about her mother's life she doesn't know, and the READER knows it must have something to do with that other timeline. The hard part, the part that takes patience, is reading far enough into the book to find out how.In the meantime, the students of the boarding school are in a complicated wargame they play every year, with the townies and the cadets over territory, that is both fascinating and amusing. Adding to the fun, the intimidating leader of the cadets has a history with Taylor, leader of the students, and the leader of the townies has a history with Taylor's second in command, Raffaela. Oh! And there's a serial killer of kids lurking in the background of the story, too. Listen, just GO with it.

The second half of the book excused the slow beginning.The emotion in the book was so raw and touching. Once you understood the relationships and how everyone was linked, you could not help but be affected by the characters' stories. The story went in an opposite direction to what I was expecting by reading the first 100 or so pages. The plot seemed a bit silly and unemotional at the beginning, but it takes a quick change. I don't really want to go into the storyline, because it takes an unpredictable course. When I read this book I had no idea what to expect, and my confusion wasn't really resolved until I was half way into the story. I had many theories as to where the story would go, and most of them were way off. I advise reading this book with no previous knowledge of the plot.

It\u2019s also the most rewarding. After being held hostage by the king of all hooks in the prologue (\u201cMy father took 132 minutes to die. I counted...\u201d), I expected the plot to unfold quickly thereafter. Instead, the mysterious plot slowly inched forward by cleverly moving backward. This story shares the lives of a group of downtrodden, neglected teenagers \u2013 many wards of the state \u2013 attending the Jellicoe School out in the \u201cboondocks.\u201d Since so few have parents in their lives, they come to depend highly on one another. Teenagers in the town have created territories and proclaimed war against opposing groups. In addition to dealing with territory disputes, seized hostages and keeping the girls of her house safe, Taylor Markham is struggling to contain the demons of her miserable past, unstable present and unpredictable future. At seemingly every turn, she finds battles to fight, drama to tame and an unlikely romance to decipher. But Taylor\u2019s biggest distraction is trying to solve the painful mysteries of her past. Melina Marchetta has written an absolute masterpiece. Appreciating this story requires an extremely patient reader who is willing to reread confusing parts several times over. Marchetta challenges her readers to make higher-level connections most authors wouldn\u2019t dare try in fear of losing their readers too soon. You may find yourself completely lost 200 and even 300 pages into this story but stick it out to the end. The book is like a puzzle with 419 pieces. Each piece of the page (i.e., each page) must be carefully considered and pieced together in the correct context in order to be fully understood. As you make it toward the end of the book, you will recall scenes throughout the story that previously had you wondering, \u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201d and you will say aloud, \u201cOooohhh!! I get it now. WOW!\u201d When, late in the story, the author began dropping subtle clues to make sense of earlier scenes, my eyes continually widened and my jaw constantly dropped - and my heart even pounded at times! Once completed, you will experience a moving story that will force you to break out the tissues and to applaud Marchetta\u2019s brilliant storytelling. Jellicoe Road is oftentimes devastating, sometimes humorous and steadily mysterious. It is an intricate, complicated story that could easily be used as part of a college-level literature course. I decided to read the book because I came across Jellicoe Road as I was trying to find good books to read on Goodreads. I noticed Jellicoe Road scored a high rating on Goodreads, so I gave it a try. While a select handful of 8th graders might be able to tackle and interpret this story, I would recommend this story mainly for advanced avid readers, high school and above.

She does not know much about her past and only has a few scattered memories of her early childhood. When she was eleven, her mother abandoned her at a gas station and a woman who lives next to her school picked her up and brought her to the school. Taylor knows that Hannah has some connection to her past, and worries when she disappears without letting Taylor know where she is going or when she will be back. While Taylor worries about her mysterious past and Hannah\u2019s location, she is also supposed to be leading her school in the annual territory wars between the townies and visiting cadets. She is also perplexed by unsettling dreams and a story about five friends who used to go to her school. Can Taylor figure out her past and not let her school down? Or will she cave under the stress?Like many people have said, this book begins slowly, but picks up as the novel progresses and the storylines start coming together. I think that the characters and plot could be appealing to some teens, particularly those who like a challenge and appreciate lots of description.

No one ever explains what's going on* and it's set in an unrealistic and unbelievable high school situation (\"wars\" for territory of trails, buildings, etc between townies, cadets, and the leader of the six houses of a boarding school which in itself seems unlikely and unrealistic) where no one goes to class.

Sometimes in a book, these sorts of breaks are nice but here they caused an ugh! and a flipping to see how many pages I had to get through.BUT - and this is an all caps worthy but - by the end, I really liked it.Here's the thing: I was mad at the book but I wanted to keep reading. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but you'll reach a shift where you stop reading just to plow through and start reading because you don't want to put it down. You've just got to be willing to stick with it long enough to make that happen.The massive mystery unwinds slowly but, and you've got to trust me here, it's worth it. There's a large cast of characters to keep track of, but (again after 200 pages) Taylor, Griggs, Raffaela, and Santangelo pull away and you don't feel so lost. Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that while the reading experience is having lots of pieces thrown at you, Marchetta's a good enough writer to hold it all together. A note on stars / recommendation / ages:Firmly between 4-5 stars, if you keep reading. I'd happily reread the second half, no doubtRecommendations are tough.

Failing that, I was certain that after nabbing a National Book Award, What I Saw and How I Lied (2008) would take a Printz award/honor.You can therefore imagine my surprise when it was neither of my predicted titles but Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road* (2008**) that won the 2009 Printz Award for excellence in young adult literature. Being a fan of Marchetta's previous novels Looking for Alibrandi (1992) and especially Saving Francesca (2005) you can also imagine my embarrassment upon realizing one of my favorite authors had published a new book without my realizing it.The only solution, of course, was to immediately procure a copy from the library and read it as soon as possible.Jellicoe Road is not a novel with one protagonist. Rather, it has many. The story starts on the Jellicoe Road with a tragic accident that will have far reaching repercussions for each character in the novel. Then, abruptly, the story starts again twenty-two years later at the Jellicoe School--the boarding school located farther down the same road--when Taylor Markham is chosen to lead the school's faction in a secret territory war that has spanned a generation between the school boarders, the Townies, and the Cadets.The Jellicoe School is the only real home Taylor has ever known. She has been at the school since she was eleven, when her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road and Hannah drove by to pick Taylor up and take her to the school. Now seventeen, Taylor is in many ways still a young girl afraid of being abandoned by those she loves. Which is why, at the start of the story, Taylor balks at the authority thrust upon her and the relationships it will necessitate. Leading the Jellicoe School through the territory wars is bad enough, but being in charge of an entire dorm of students seems truly unbearable. Taylor's resolve to live a life apart is tested, and in many ways broken, with the efforts of well-meaning friends and the appearance of Jonah Griggs--the one person Taylor never expected to see, or need, ever again.As the territory wars escalate, Taylor's life is thrown into disarray with the sudden disappearance of Hannah--the only adult Taylor would come close to calling family. With Hannah gone, Taylor begins reading Hannah's unfinished novel for lack of anything else to cling to. Marchetta weaves Taylor's story and the events of Hannah's novel and even the histories of other characters together to create one haunting narrative where, the more Taylor reads, the more it feels like she is looking not at fictitious characters but at people she has known her entire life.While trying to understand Hannah's sudden absence, Taylor also starts to understand herself. Eventually she realizes that living life at a distance offers no protection from abandonment and provides even fewer options to heal scars from past betrayals.The novel starts with rapid fire narration as Taylor throws out events and names at the reader without any frame of reference. Later in the story the importance of the Cadet, the Hermit, and the Brigadier becomes painfully obvious. But in the first pages the narrative comes closer to painfully confusing and unwieldy. By the end of my reading I had a marker at almost every page to indicated important points and favorite passages. However, if you can roll with the uncertainty, you will be rewarded. At a little over four hundred pages, Marchetta still creates a page-turner that moves quickly and weaves together every single narrative thread by the final page.Because Taylor is not forthcoming with explanations, the novel reads like a mystery (fitting since my two Printz Award predictions were also mysteries of sorts). However a good portion of the story is also simply about friendship and love. Taylor expects neither from her time on the Jellicoe Road even though they might be exactly what she was supposed to find there all along. Marchetta blends moments of humor and gravitas in her unique prose style to create another really great read.* Jellicoe Road was actually originally published, I assume in Marchetta's native Australia, with the title On the Jellicoe Road. For various reasons, upon finishing the novel, I feel that this title is superior to the American edition's shortened version.** The book was originally published, again I assume in Australia, in 2006.*** In addition to the original title being superior, in terms of relevance to the story, the original cover art is also much more apt. (Although I just realized the US cover has a Poppy on it which I will grudgingly admit is actually pretty relevant to the story. It also makes it impossible to pick a cover to feature here so, readers, you get both.)", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": ["owned"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/51530461", "review_id": "51530461", "date": "Apr 04, 2009", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Amy", "user_url": "/user/show/2142789-amy", "text": "Had a hard time getting through this.

Might have just been me getting my panties in a bunch over nothing. The other thing (and this might be a big thing for some readers) is that I put the pieces together too soon. Before the narrator. In some cases many many pages before the narrator. While I do pride myself on being an expert reader, this bugs me. I feel like I shouldn't know something WAY before the main character does. I should maybe think...could that be? nah, there would have been more hints....not Oh I get it now. Wait....she doesn't? Seriously? So yeah. Other than those two points, I really liked this book.

Printz Award. Taylor Markham is the main character in this novel filled with mystery, emotion, tragedy, and love. Taylor must solve the puzzle of her past, and make the necessary connections to the present, in order to ensure her future. All the while she is coping with being head of her boarding school dorm, and finds herself representing her school in the territorial war with the Townies and the Cadets. Further complications ensue when she discovers that the Cadets are lead by Jonah Griggs, another part of her past she can\u2019t seem to leave behind. The truth all comes to light on the Jellicoe Road, \u201cthe prettiest road I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026\u201d. Developmentally the book delves into teenage peer relationships, the importance of family and one\u2019s past, and the ultimate need for love and to belong (versus abandonment, etc.). The book is full of mystery, adventure, and surprising twists and turns that have definite young adult appeal. The only problem is that the novel is quite confusing in the beginning, going between Taylor in the present and Hannah\u2019s manuscript of the past. I must admit that it is difficult to get into the novel initially, and I\u2019m not sure if young adults will read far enough into the story to get hooked. I would promote the book with other award winners, taking the opportunity to educate teens on the various awards and honors available to young adult literature.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "oldest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/52935311", "review_id": "52935311", "date": "Apr 16, 2009", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Lara", "user_url": "/user/show/309689-lara", "text": "This book is going to haunt me.
