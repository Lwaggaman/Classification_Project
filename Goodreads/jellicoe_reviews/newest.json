In the meantime, the school is entrenched in territory wars with students from other organizations, including one led by a boy with whom Taylor has a lot of history.

I am a mess! I finished this book last night and I WEPT through the last few chapters! My heart has been ripped out of my chest. My God, this book! This book is BREATHTAKING! This book is a triumph! It is that truly rare gem that you know will forever redefine excellence in your mind, and every other \u201cgreat\u201d book will now be compared to, and you already know will likely pale in comparison to. This book is the BEST YA novel I have ever read. This book may be one of the best books I have EVER read in my LIFE!Honestly, I don\u2019t have the words to describe the astonishing beauty that is this story and this prose. What a privilege it was to have this reading experience! What a privilege it was to know these characters! What a privilege it was to be captivated by this gorgeous prose! A friend of mine who\u2019s an avid reader had been recommending this book to me for years! I wish I had listened to her much earlier! This book should have been my absolute priority! When I finally started reading it, I was very confused! I spent the first 25% of the book not knowing what is going on. In fact, I read the first 25% twice, in hopes of finding some important info I had missed the first time. Then I got very nervous that I\u2019m not going to like the book because it doesn\u2019t make sense and I\u2019m going to disappoint my friend by going back and saying I have no idea what she liked about this book! O, Ye of Little Faith! I needn\u2019t have worried one bit! Every single sentence here has a purpose. Every single piece of the puzzle will masterfully fall into place. It all comes together BEAUTIFULLY! I don\u2019t really want to talk about the plot. In my opinion, it\u2019s best to go into this book knowing as little as possible about it. And if you really need to know what the story is about, it\u2019s been discussed in great detail by so many other reviewers. I\u2019d rather talk about how it made me FEEL all the feelings. Suffice to say that the book explores some heavy themes, but at its heart, it is a coming of age story; a story about finding who you are and where you belong, and where you long to be. it\u2019s a story about devastating heartbreak, loneliness, immense loss, but also resilience, the absolute healing power of friendships, the beauty of first love, and the places and people who make us feel like we are home.This book has a complex plot, one that is structured intricately. There are dual narratives and a large cast of characters. You could say there\u2019s a lot going on, and the book is under 300 pages! But what you have to understand is that this is not your average run of the mill YA. You\u2019re in the hands of a true genius! This is a rich and complicated tale. And it\u2019s very sophisticated, both in the themes it explores, and in the art of storytelling. The author seamlessly moves between the dual narratives, and slowly, slowly, unravels the mystery elements and unspools the thread that will connect all the pieces.By the end, you\u2019ll sit there, absolutely stunned. Not just by how the dual narratives come together perfectly and harmoniously, but by the small details, the subtle connections that truly take your breath away. You\u2019ll come to find that nothing was wasted here. That every little comment, every tidbit of info, and every thought was there for a reason, and they all create such a tsunami of emotions within you! The prose is truly hauntingly beautiful. Melina Marchetta is an astonishing wordsmith! Few can do what she has done here! Very few!It is extraordinary how the author manages such a large cast of characters so masterfully. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, and I couldn\u2019t help but to care about each and every one of them. God, I don\u2019t remember having read many books where I fell so deeply in love with so many of the characters, even the minor ones. And the punchy dialogues! They were so real. I giggled reading some of them. But then again, I also cried many times, reading Taylor\u2019s narration of her story. What an emotional rollercoaster this was!This book did something to me. It sliced through my heart, cut a piece of it, and stole it forever! This is a book I will never forget! One I suspect I will come back to again in the future. This book deserves to be read by all, and not just young adults. Not the likes of Twilight, which for some incomprehensible reason steals the spotlight. This is the caliber YA literature should be.I kneel before you  Melina Marchetta. You\u2019ve bewitched me. You\u2019ve somehow bottled up magic and served it up in this 300-page package. Thank you for this book! We are not worthy!5 shiny starts, but only because the GoodReads scale cannot do this book justice!

It's one of the best YA novels I think I've ever read; it's real and gritty, with flawed characters that don't make all the right choices, but you at least understand why they do what they do.I'm a sucker for good character development, and I do feel like Taylor - and some of the supporting characters to a lesser extent (Jude! Jonah!)- go through quite a bit of change; I love watching as characters learn to open up and let people in. I really liked the 2 timelines, and trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle and figure it out. The more I think about it, the more parallels I can see between the 2 friend groups and their stories. (I love way the 2nd group is kind of a redemption of the 1st, and they come out even stronger). The friendships that are formed are my favourite part, I loved Chaz, Raffy, Jonah!!, and Taylor. Around 60% I did figure out the biggest \"reveal\", but I was still eager to see how the characters would find out. It's a beautifully written book about broken, hurting people and the friendships that save them.

The characters are written very well and the concept is executed well, though it took me time to understand everything in the beginning phase but later it turns into an absolute gem. The book balances the different arcs and emotions well. It starts a bit slow but takes on pace when more things are explained and revealed. I don't know how to express how much I love this book. if you feel bored or confused, go back, it's worth the read and the ending makes up for everything.

Melina Marchetta did it again, she wrenched my heart. This book was really\u2026 something. It started off very confusing, not going to lie, therefore hard to stick to it. Kids talking about House leaders and territory wars and what faction owns what and Taylor\u2019s very difficult personality and my attention span was not having it. It was also hard to differentiate what was a POV, what was a flashback and a dream, it took me until chapter 9, where our protagonist mentions one of the original 5\u2019s name as part of a story she is reading that I realized what was what from whom. And then, Taylor grew on me just like her house girls grew on her and I understood her and where she was coming from and I just could not stop reading. I just needed to know what happened to these 5 kids and I just needed Taylor to get her answers and I needed to know how all their lives were connected. Marchetta has a talent for that, knotting people\u2019s lives in her stories in such a beautiful way. I have so much love for Taylor and Jonah and Raffaela and Chaz and Ben and Jessa even Anson Choi and the Mullet Brothers. It was beautiful to see their friendship bloom. I had the strong need to protect every single one of these characters throughout the whole book.I am in love with the way Marchetta writes emotions, and how strongly you can feel her characters feel them. She also has a talent for presenting you a character who you might not see in a good light at the beginning and instead of giving them this miraculous redemption arc, she explains their reasons and you, without noticing, accept this character, root for them. Fucked up characters doing their best to survive. My kind of book.

It was intense and gripped me so much that I almost couldn't believe it was YA fiction. It's a book centred on teenaged characters, but it feels very mature, and a lot of the subject matter is heavy and dark - I don't think I could imagine myself reading this as a teenager. I thought the way the author connected the characters and tied up all the storylines was very elegant. Half the story is written from the main character, Taylor Markham's perspective, while the other half is written in italics. At first it was really difficult to keep the two storylines and numerous characters separate, but at the end, it becomes very clear and every character is significant and has a clear connection to each storyline. I took 1 star away because I thought the \"territory war\" between the Townies and the Cadets seemed juvenile and out of place. I felt that it wasn't as realistic as it could have been, because the characters seemed so mature, and at the same time they were participating in some odd war game. I wish the plot didn't centre so much on the territory war since it was pretty insignificant near the end. Anyway - if you are a fan of YA fiction and are looking for something that is well-written and mature, I would recommend this one.

She knows that her friend Hannah knows more about her past than she has let on, but when Hannah goes missing Taylor is left wondering just how much she knows. The leader of the cadets is Jonah, another reminder of her past that she is forced to reconcile. Trying to juggle a pretend war, school, her past, and the sudden vanishment of Hannah leaves Taylor struggling to understand herself and what's important. I found myself relating to Taylor a lot more than I thought I would. Her struggle with her mental health because of her past is relatable and heartwarming. Hannah's story is also being told during the novel, and while I enjoyed it sometimes it took me out of the story that I typically found myself right in the middle of.

If I searched for the finest combination of words and managed to come up with a pragmatic sentence like \u201cthis book was a primal example of top-notch storytelling\u201d, it would be like diminishing the lengths of its emotional reach just to make it fit in a closed space of category, turn it into something you can shelve and put away, and it deserves more than that. Marchetta\u2019s story was an orchestra of paradoxes that exploded and sunk into itself at the same time \u2014 it talked about love and hate, comfort and grief, harvesting and destruction, life and death. It talked about friendships and war and how sometimes it can only take one second for your entire world to fall apart, burn into dust. And I can\u2019t even begin to express how reading it felt so heavy, like the weight of gravity was suddenly pressing down on me, and the cold melancholy it oozed out of every chapter frosted my fingertips and made me feel numb.

Art means a whole lot more when it is capable of inciting emotions of that caliber in someone.Don\u2019t ask me to explain the logistics of this book. It was confusing and a little nauseating at first, seeing the feud between the Cadets, the school and the Townies present itself with scattered pieces and chaotic figures. But trust me when I say that the unfolding of the thread that binds these three forces is an experience unlike anything you\u2019ve read before. Through the painfully nostalgic perspective of Taylor, the story behind the accident that happened in Jellicoe Road and of the people who lost a family but gained another because of it appears like colorful dust in the air and reading about it is like trying to grab everything at once. But your hands get stained and there\u2019s still so much to see and you want to consume this book all at once even though it\u2019s so sad and inflammable that it hurts. I loved it so much but...

It\u2019s both heart-wrenching and uplifting and so captivating. It has one of the strongest and most beautiful friendships I\u2019ve ever read about.At age eleven, Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother. At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor\u2019s the reluctant leader of her school\u2019s underground community, but her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. When Hannah disappears Taylor\u2019s search for her unveils a truth that might not just settle her past, but also change her future.The story is told in two different timelines, the past via a manuscript that Taylor finds, and the present. It\u2019s so well-written and planned in every little detail and so suspenseful in how it slowly reveals the connections between events in the past and present times.

I didn't really like the final mystery-reveal-slash-plot-twist, but it made the story all the more unique.I've got a secret love for the kind of conflict like the \"territory war\" in On the Jellicoe Road. No weapons, just teens trying to outsmart each other following the idea of a war but without casualties. In this aspect, this book has got a lot of \nThe War of the Buttons\n in it.IMO, the character growth throughout the story is worth the read. The dynamics. The growing friendships. The book starts cold and progresses towards warm.

A culmination of ugly and beautiful things that most often we don\u2019t get to choose. We get dealt a lot and it depends on how we play the cards. The realization crept up on me slowly, until the story settled within my skin. I couldn\u2019t read a book for a few days after because it was hard to get this story out of my mind. And that in itself is the mark of a five-star read.I love how effortlessly Marchetta weaves the tale of Fitz, Tate, Web, Narnie and Jude that took place so long in the past alongside Taylor\u2019s own story and interspersing it with the tiny amusements of the Territory war that allowed friendships to grow between Taylor and the contemporaries from the other school.

It's like it was doing everything possible to confuse me by constantly flitting between present and dreams and Hannah's story, but I don't feel like it actually added anything to the overall story by doing that. Like I still guessed all the revelations and it didn't make it more impactful by confusing me the entire time, I feel like if it was told in a less random time-jump way I could've felt these moments a lot more. There's these great emotional beats at the end that honestly didn't hit me the way I knew they should have because it took so long to get to it. Also the beginning plot of their 'house wars' or whatever was as dumb as it sounded and legit led nowhere. It felt like such ridiculous forced conflict and wasn't even well explained enough for me to care. It took itself far too seriously and I found myself eye-rolling for a lot of it and waiting for the real meat of the story to happen. I also found the main relationship and Taylor herself super grating. All of their decisions are beyond frustrating and I know they're teenagers and I know they need to grow in their arc, but I didn't really find myself routing for them for most of the book. By the end I enjoyed them enough separately that I was like, 'ok sure, fine' but again didn't hit me the way I felt it should've. Overall this book was just super weird.

It will send you through such a spiral of emotions that in the end I promise you will be clutching it to your body just as I am right now and I promise that it will NEVER leave you. This is the only book I have ever read that I can just never stop thinking about.The characters are everything, the plot is everything, this book is EVERYTHING.It could be a little confusing in the beginning, but that\u2019s only because you are trying to piece together Taylor\u2019s life along with her. You feel every bit of emotion and confusion Taylor feels, and I think that is just the best kind of confusion.If I haven\u2019t already convinced you, let me leave you with this: whenever I see this book in a store, I have a physical reaction. When I see it new, I literally almost cry and thank whatever god or force there is out there that the store even carries it and I clutch it and shake as I bring it up to the counter to buy it in a heartbeat. When I see it in a thrift store I have to just stand there in shock because I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would get rid of it! And then of course I buy it even though I already have multiple copies because it is the book that makes me feel like it isn\u2019t just a bundle of paper. I see a copy and I see something so beautiful, something that is almost alive, and I can\u2019t bear to leave it behind.Read. This.

At the age of 7, Taylor was abandoned by her mom at a 7-Eleven in Jellicoe. When she was 14, Taylor attempted to run away to Sydney to find her mom. But the boy she was with called for help, and her journey was cut short. Three years later, Taylor is now the head of her House at Jellicoe school, and she must take lead in the annual territory wars between the school, the Townies and the Cadets. But when Hannah, the closest thing Taylor has to a parent, Taylor starts down a path of discovery that will reveals a tragic history on the Jellicoe Road. One that she is a part of. I truly enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed the territory wars between the three factions and how this year's leaders have entangled histories with each other. As this novel is told from Taylor's POV, it is interesting to see her view of things contrasted against the dialogue of other characters. There is a particular instance where we learn that despite Taylor's behavior, the girls in her house truly care about her. There book contains lessons on friendship, the pain and healing found in tragedy, and how a single life event can completely alter the course of ones life. The story has a few triggers. It mildly touches on drugs and the destruction they bring about, and there is one mention of child pedophilia. However, suicide plays a heavier hand in the book.Looking back on the book, I realize there are plenty of characters involved in the story that I wish we got to know a bit better. In the moment, I was caught up in Taylor's experiences, but I would have loved to know more about Jonah, Chaz and Rafaela's histories. Also, I got stuck for a moment between the epilogue and chapter 1. The book states there is a 22 year time gap, but when chapter 1 starts, Taylor is 17 years old. Took me a few minutes longer than it should have to think \"Oh, Taylor must not be one of the people involved in the epilogue.\"Overall, a great read.

And I don\u2019t quit books easily. However, at 35% percent into the story, the writer should have provided a general overview, but this novel was entirely directionless. Without the blurb, I would not have had a clue what is going on. This scene threw me off: a panel of senior students from a boarding school discussing territorial rights with the leaders of the local school kids and a neighbouring military school. In fact, the council is about access to waterways - as if any of them had any actual claim to the land. This territorial dispute is never even properly explained. The novel seems to have two main characters. On the one hand, there is Taylor, now 17 [I will never understand the trend to upgrade occupations into female first names], who at 11 was abandoned by her mother at a petrol station, and at 14 tried to run away from said boarding school to find her mother. On the run, she somehow fraternized with Jonah, a \"Cadet\" and now her antagonist. However, this backstory is structured as one big secret with only morsels of information thrown in. Taylor is also a particularly mopey, unappealing character. Yawn. Then there is Hannah, a woman in her 30s who survived a car crash as a child. She lives on the school premises and is Taylor\u2019s friend. Somehow she is a main character, even though she has been missing since page 1. Again, lots of mysterious hints. Apparently, at the end you find out how all the events and characters are connected to each other. But I obviously don\u2019t care to find out. I don\u2019t know why this book is so successful.

Years later, she is the leader of the Jellicoe School students and is somewhat cynical due to the betrayals she has experienced throughout the years. However, she isn't the only one to face such hardships. Throughout the book, different characters face the struggles and trauma that burden them. As Taylor confronts her past, she learns more about love, friendship, and healing. Reaction: I love how the author expressed Taylor's thoughts and feelings. She is an interesting character, sharing some special quirks to which I can relate. For example, in the very first chapter, she mentions certain words that are perfect for describing her situation. That is such a small thing, but it caught my attention. Even though I appreciate her character, I am saddened by the experiences she faces in the novel. She and the other characters have some pretty serious trauma. It caused me to reflect on my own life and feel very grateful for my circumstances.

The wars is very simple but the resolution of the war is not executed well I think because it just suddenly dissolves over the holiday break and also SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! it is a not so mind blowing that the wars is just an invented game. HERE IS WHAT I LOVE, I love that all that story in the first half slowly interweaves and make sense onto the second half of the book. That is if you remember the deets in the first half. More revelations coming in which I will not spoil thats just heart warming and endearing. It is like a puzzle that you have to figure out piece by piece in order to fit. I was definitely able to predict who is who and which is which. The pace is engaging on the second half but the first half is so-so. I wish I have seen more about Tate perspective or at least a background of it. Overall I enjoyed reading it despite the trecherous first half.I HAVE TO BE HONEST this is not a wow book for me. I mean it was okay, but not the same reaction that the majority has...I get tripped off and put off by the switching of persepctive sometime. There are times I have to go back to tell who was talking. And sometimes I could not take the insensitiveness of Taylor even though she has a very tragic past and maybe a rough childhood I will not be able to justify her rudeness with those. I mean come on she supposed to be a leader right! But I felt like there are parts that she is so self centered.

I wish they have made known that the war was an invented game not just made a party which forces all three groups to mibgke which other with no explanation whatsoever except that fact that Taylor and Jonah pashed.

I don't really know how to explain the experience that was this book but I'm going to try.This book is almost two stories in one. We have the present day story told in fist person by Taylor. Then in between chapters we get the second story told in third person that follows a group of friends after they share a traumatic experience. Over the book, these two stories merged in such a way that it will leave you speechless. And that is where the magic of this book lies.So why not five stars? To be honest, I had a really hard time getting into the book initially. Marchetta throws you in with little no background or explanations and there seemed to be no solid ground to grab onto. I didn't understand the townie vs cadets vs students war that was going on or how it was so violent with no consequences. And I also didn't warm up to Taylor right away. She's a very prickly character who seems to care for no one - not even herself. As the story goes on, we get to know more about her and eventually I understand her actions. It was a bold choice to start the novel this way and ultimately it's why I gave it four stars.My absolute favorite part of this story was the past glimpses. That group of five kids just broke my heart and when I discovered the secrets and how they fit into the present, I was a sobbing mess.

I've completely immersed myself the characters' incredibly realistic lives, facing horrors that they have been forced to behold. The psychological depth of the characters is insanely complex, which is probably the highlight of this book. Living in the heart of Sydney rather than the rural setting of Jellicoe Road, I don't think I ever understood how different the culture is there, and how people living in those areas see Sydney in such a different light. It was especially jarring to see familiar suburbs and australian jargon mentioned, especially since I had NO idea that this book was in any way australian. I have no idea how non-australian readers would get every single reference, like the school level system eg. \"year eleven\" or the popular TV show Home and Away. On a kind of unrelated note, Kings Cross is MUCH safer today, which is why I was so shocked at the description the book gave.I still have to say, the plot was very confusing even to the end, and the construction of the plot had little logical sense, even if it moved character arcs forward and clues into light. For example, the warring tribe system between the Cadets, Townies and the Houses absurdly seemed to be taken too seriously one moment and then the rules were very quickly ignored the next. There was a lack of motive and reason why characters chose to do certain things, like breaking into the Brigadier's tent and having a party at the Club House. These could almost be plot holes, but I'm willing to put them away as devices to make the story more efficient.Overall I'm rather conflicted on how to rate this.

(i promise you this isn't the whole plot and also it gets really confusing at the beginning.) hannah, her guardian/mentor, disappears and it sends taylor looking for clues to find her, which leads to taylor uncovering her past. all of that heaviness occurs in the midst of teenage shenanigans so it's the perfect blend of light and heavy. i liked this book. it took a while for me to vibe with it because the whole territorial wars did not make sense to me at all and quite frankly, i don't really know if it makes sense to the characters either. if you can't get past that, then i don't think the whole story is for you. in any case, i resolved to finish this book so i forced myself to get through it\u2014which turned out to be not such a chore as marchetta's writing is easy to read and the characters and the hints at their relationships are fun. there's also the matter of shifting POVs through flashbacks, but the flashbacks are in italics so it's easy to distinguish. the whole kids in love during the summer was great and fun, but it blindsides you and leaves you vulnerable for what's to come. because when it gets to around the 250-ish page mark, that's when you know that shit is about to go down. and go down it did because the story gave me such complete heartache. i'm completely torn apart by the events at the end. the characters were great although i didn't really connect with them, i was definitely attached. i liked how the taylor/jonah/raffy/chaz friendship was written and i cried even more over \"what are you so sad about? we're going to know him for the rest of our lives.\" honestly, out of the original five, jude was a surprise character for me because it hurts to think about him. he's kind of the outsider of the group, longing to be a part of it but when he does, it's under the most terrible circumstances. this book was by no means perfect. as i said, the beginning was a little difficult to get into. i may be in the minority but i didn't really care about the romance\u2014i understand that the author draws parallels between taylor/jonah and both webb/tate and narnie/jude but uh it's not for me. they had a good enemies to lovers thing going on and a shared past but they were just okay if not a little too intense for me. it also had two sex scenes that the book could have gone without. minor things in the midst of how much the story touched me. overall, this was a good read and if you're in the mood to cry and read about deep and life-changing friendships then this is the book for you.

But it also taught me about the power of friendship and hope; how when you\u2019re lost, you can find a home in the people you love. And I know for a fact, it\u2019s a story I\u2019ll find myself revisiting time and time again.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "newest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3358546599", "review_id": "3358546599", "date": "Jun 09, 2020", "rating": 4, "user_name": "Deepti", "user_url": "/user/show/114685561-deepti", "text": "I completely loved this book! Despite the tragic backdrop to the story, it still feels so beautiful and uplifting to read. At first I was extremely confused with exactly what was going on, but once I learned that the territory wars are just a game, the book became a lot more easier to read. The book is about a girl named Taylor Markham whose drug-addicted mom left her with Hannah, her caretaker for the meantime. It follows her journey as she uncovers more about her past and takes part, alongside her friends, in these \u201cterritory wars\u201d between the Cadets and the Townies. This book is very unique to me, and its style is different from anything else I\u2019ve read. The story deals with such dark themes, yet Taylor takes these made-up territory wars with her friends very seriously. To me, it added this imaginative and whimsical nature to the book which almost felt out of place since the story gets so dark. Also, although the book was very confusing in the beginning, I actually came to appreciate that because it makes us empathize more with Taylor who\u2019s also left in the dark with her own past.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "newest", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3378287005", "review_id": "3378287005", "date": "Jun 08, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "phelkyi", "user_url": "/user/show/70729225-phelkyi", "text": "Finished my 3rd reread on 1/4/21 Starting off the new year by rereading Jellicoe Road and it hurts so bad.

The characters scurry their way into your heart and refuse to leave once they've settled there. The inter-generational threads woven through the narrative make it a fervent, heartrending family saga, filled with passionate friendship and tense love. Melina Marchetta's stories are often, at their roots, always about the same thing: people connecting with other people. Forging relationships and connections that last through lifetimes. Characters who begin the story when they're lonely and end the story when they aren't lonely anymore.This book has an atmosphere that you want to sink into. It's like a dream you don't want to wake up from. I can tell I'm going to be re-reading it soon, to lose myself in the story and characters and the ambience once again. 4.5 stars", "num_likes": 17, "sort_order": "newest", "shelves": ["favourites-2020", "contemporary", "mystery", "amazing-friendships"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2757011477", "review_id": "2757011477", "date": "May 03, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Mariam Elnaggar", "user_url": "/user/show/54462221-mariam-elnaggar", "text": "I love this book with every piece of my heart \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd7a \n\n", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "newest", "shelves": ["favourite-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3309782495", "review_id": "3309782495", "date": "May 01, 2020", "rating": 5, "user_name": "Samantha (WLABB)", "user_url": "/user/show/25774455-samantha-wlabb", "text": "I have always heard so much about Melina Marchetta's books, and after loving Saving Francesca, I was ready for more. This is one of her books, that has been heaped with praise, so I thought it would be a great next book.I must say, the book was a journey, for both me and the characters. I went from \"this is weird\" to \"what the heck is happening\" to \"THIS IS AMAZING!\". There was this beautiful story of connection, forgiveness, love, and friendship wrapped up in a mystery. Taylor had been abandoned on Jellicoe Road at age eleven, and more or less, cared for by Hannah, whose disappearance set the whole story in motion. In her search, Taylor found Hannah's manuscript, and though it seemed random at the time, she was soon able to draw parallels between the fictional lives of the characters and her own.At the same time, Taylor was leading her team in the annual boundary battle between her school, the townies, and the cadets. Alliances formed, and grew into something quite wonderful. These unlikely friendships brought me so much happiness, and it meant a lot to me, that Taylor found her people.As Taylor found more and more clues in her search for Hannah, I watched all the pieces fall into place, and then, all the feels were unleashed on me. Once it started, I couldn't stop the avalanche of emotions that began filling me up. There were lots of tears as it all became clearer, but there was a lot of joy in there too.I had to be patient, and let Marchetta lay the foundation for this wonderful tale. And, let me tell you, I was rewarded ten-fold as all the seemingly separate threads began to weave themselves together. To quote The Dead, \"what a long strange trip it's been\", and it's one I don't regret taking.
