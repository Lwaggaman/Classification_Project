After all of the glowing reviews for this one, I was prepared to be blown away. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way for me. It ended up being an \"okay\" story for me.My first problem has less to do with the actual story, and more to do with the format that I chose. I listened to the Audible edition and that was a big mistake. The problem didn't stem from the quality of narration, so much as the complexity of the story. There were simply too many moving parts for me to try and keep track of while listening to an audiobook. It is incredibly hard to pull off a book like this in audiobook format and it didn't work for me.I spent hours trying to figure out who the characters were and what the hell was going on. The transitions between characters and time frames was not always obvious, making matters even worse. I must have been hours into the story before I figured out that there were actually two stories playing out -- one in the present and one in the past. Needless to say, I lost a lot of time being utterly confused and unaware of what was going on. By the time I began to piece some things together, I had already missed so many of the \"connections\" and details that it was kind of pointless. When the big reveals came toward the end, they were kind of meaningless to me. I never really connected with the characters or the storyline. I had simply missed too much to play catch-up at that point.The story centers on Taylor Markham, a girl that was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road by her mother at the age of 11. She lives at a boarding school (orphanage???). When the lady that has taken care of her disappears, she is certain that something is amiss. Taylor sets out to find Hannah, or discover what really happened to her. When she runs across a book/journal written by Hannah, she begins to unveil some long-standing secrets. Along with some friends from her school, she has several creepy encounters and a variety of adventures. There is some sort of rivalry described between the two groups of kids...but I was pretty confused so I can't say I ever really grasped what that was about for sure.Overall, this ended up being a middle of the road story for me. I do suspect that I'm not doing this story justice though. I was just too lost for most of the book to take much away from the experience this time around. I do plan to re-read this in the future, because I have some lingering questions. I'm sure they were answered along the way and I just didn't catch it. I definitely won't be listening to the audiobook on my second attempt. This story will require my full attention.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com ", "num_likes": 150, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["listened-to-audio-version", "childhood-loves", "dark-themes", "forbidden-romance", "shocking-twists", "wtf-did-i-just-read"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2040531999", "review_id": "2040531999", "date": "Jun 25, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "emma", "user_url": "/user/show/32879029-emma", "text": "THIS IS NOT A ROAST!!!!!!NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HATE, DISOWN, OR OTHERWISE PUNISH ME BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RANT REVIEW!!!!!!!I'm giving it three stars okay????

One of the busiest months I ever had where I\u2019d become a walking robot because of the workloads I had. I was eager to read this book because most of my bookish friends raved about it, and I\u2019m glad I was able to start reading with this book. I remember asking, \u201cWhat is waiting for me ahead of this story?\u201d, and they said, \u201cRollie, my friend, when you go there, you\u2019ll see,\u201d and that was the last phrase I want to hear from them.Yes, I was eager to read this book not just because I required myself to read this, for this is our Book Club\u2019s book of the month, but because this book was scheduled to be read in February this year. Since this book won the poll to be our book for this month\u2014May\u2014I really waited for the right time to come for me to read this book.Confusing? I agree. The first half of the book was supplemented with consistent clueless information that readers couldn\u2019t make out the sense. I believe to what they said that the whole story is as if a jigsaw puzzle. Looking at it at the very first place, you\u2019ll get confused. As the story goes on, the pattern to get the puzzle whole is gradually revealing. I liked how the italic letters affect how I visualized the situations presented. Further, I admire the author at how the manuscript written in a way that it differs a lot to the other narration. The moods of two narrations are way different that they both clung to their respective generations. I liked also how Marchetta becomes picky of words and finicky of sentence constructions in order for her to present well the emotion she intended. To say I cried is an overstatement. I was just saddened at how the past story ended up. I accidentally attached myself to the friendship since I could relate the situation. The difference was just I consider their friendship perfect and filled with love. The group wasn\u2019t just a circle of friends but it became their own home. The group has become their own family. Sad to realize is that they were created through accident, yet they were destroyed through accident. I couldn\u2019t help but hope for Taylor to have a father alive since there was no concrete confirmation of what happened until the epilogue justified. If there\u2019s a scene I loved the most, it\u2019s the last\u2014epilogue. In that scene, I saw a picture of love, happiness, dream and fulfillment. Right in that moment when he saw Fitz innocence occurred, tragic it appealed but pure happiness was underneath.If there\u2019s one person I empathized the most, it\u2019s Hermit. I could see the weight of his burden since the accident. I could feel his guilt that he wasn\u2019t able to control it up. I could understand his hunger for forgiveness from the dead who wouldn\u2019t give it to him already. I feel empathy for him for spending a very happy day with Taylor and end his self with a gun just as he thought his burden was gone.If there\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t like much about this book, it\u2019s how the Taylor\u2019s story became dull. The revelations of the past outshine the present\u2019s story. I even can\u2019t believe she\u2019s the daughter of two amazing people in Narnie\u2019s manuscript. I believe that the present-time narrative was just an instrument and the past\u2019s was the real underscore. Yet I\u2019m happy that in a way I made the journey with story along Jellicoe Road.", "num_likes": 24, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/266985500", "review_id": "266985500", "date": "Jan 24, 2012", "rating": 3, "user_name": "kwesi \u7ae0\u82f1\u72ee", "user_url": "/user/show/4218875-kwesi", "text": "\n*Photo taken from The Filipino Group and created by Aaron, you can read his review here.\nJellicoe Road, the prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.\nThe place is dark and I can't nearly see everything that surrounds me. With a lampshade sitting on my side and a long pillow sleeping in the other, this is the night that will fulfill my dream, my dream to visit the well-known Jellicoe Road. The prettiest among the roads without walking, just a simple stare and a very long read. Silence. I can hear the laughs of the children and the memories, ready to burst in a second, written in the cold stones for years. The history is ready and the skirmish, begin!Jellicoe Road, written by an Asutralian author Melina Marchetta, is my first book from her best and well-known works for years. It was a pity that I never touched her books in the past and somebody should pull me around and feed me her book just to read it, and it was great! I can't believe it, reading Melina Marchetta is an exciting new experience. Something everyone will enjoy or not, somehow the target of the book is straight to your heart.I would like to thank Aaron for sharing this book with everyone and to his great F2F discussion last Saturday (May 20, 2012). The laser tag was fun and I would like to give another round but my breath is chocking me in my neck but in the end, I did not make it. I would like to discuss the book with others but in the simplest way, I write a review for everyone to understand why I gave this book three stars and also thanks to Jzhun for sharing his insights but the night left me hang forever.\n[image error]The TFG (The Filipino Group) peeps were running away from zombies inside a dark neon-colored room with laser guns to kill those fuck up creatures. Kidding. The peeps were just having fun tagging each other and the winner is, ugh, the Red team (not my team). Guys, we'll do better next time! Aja!Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven years old and when she was fourteen, she tried to escape the boarding school to search for her mom in Sydney, but the attempt was failed and met the guy of her life. At seventeen, she was pointed as the head of the underground community; she will lead her team to an annual territory game with the Cadets and the Townies. But when she is in need of someone in her life, Hannah (her guardian) was lost and the clues left behind will lead her to the history of the skirmish game and will change her future forever.When I first read the first chapter of the book, which is a very long introduction besides the very short heartwarming prologue, I was so confused that I wanted to put the book down from my hand but my instinct keep me from reading it or maybe I was so frightened not to finish the book on time. The first chapter will first lead you to Taylor assigned as the leader of the underground community in in the boarding school to lead the territory war among the Townies, Cadets and them. Because Marchetta only spilled small amount of facts regarding the territory war or the skirmish and the school terminologies because I'm not used to Australian educational system, the readers will find it a bit confusing, no, very confusing, that in fact few of the TFGs in the past who attempted to read it put it down as early as Marchetta will spill the bucket of facts in the middle of the book. Well, only the courageous one can finish Jellicoe Road and will wash himself from Marchetta's magnum revelations.The manuscript, which is another story of a group of friends in the old town and written by Hannah, Taylor's guardian, was another cool element of the story and a friend of mine, Aaron, site it as the \"dual narrative\" (a good blog post from Guy Gone Geek about The Duality of a Narrative.) Dual narrative is another effective technique to show the story of two different characters, places or period and usually tell the story in two different perspectives. The Manuscript gone mad and it was the mystery in the two point of views that made me connect the dots from the first page to the last. Well, it was predictable and I find it a little bit disappointing; because I want the mystery will not reveal itself until the epilogue of the book or maybe I expected a lot from Marchetta. Maybe some, the dual narrative may find it a work of another genius, for me, it's just another technique that other authors mastered.Lately, I have this close connection between the main characters of the books I read. And I hate the most about Taylor is when she whine because her life sucks! Yeah, there are those when she keeps on whining and repeating her problems from her head and blame others of putting her into that state. From that, she pointed out other characters as that and other these to confuse readers. Unfortunately, in my case, I'm not and I stuck to my own idea of who was that and who were these. This kind of character might be an effective one, but this kind of character annoys me a lot or maybe her hormones should be blame here. The capital S part is quiet disappointing, it's too short to be good like they are just doing it because of heat, maybe. There is no love that night but purely physical. I love her, because she acted like a strong mother to others.But what I love most in the book is the setting of the story. Was it real or not? I'm just a curious lad who really wanted to visit Jellicoe Road. Whether fictional or not, the setting of the book made me jump with over excitement that I though I'm walking into the forest, where branches are lying to each other making a canopy. It's like heaven on Earth, a shangri-la itself! I missed my place, I lived in a small town before and those branches, well, they really exist and the view, well, it's another real issue. Other than that, I also manage to observe that each ending of each chapter had a heartwarming touch of sadness. It's a good motive to continue my reading, I feel solace.Reading Jellicoe Road, well, it was like how the Sydney Morning Herald said:\n\"Melina Marchetta has a knack for writing stories that swallow you up and refuse to let you go until you've read every last word.\"You don't have to pick most of the positive sides of the book, it's just that the book already push you into reading even not liking it as much as your friends does and not knowing the possible reasons why.\n[image error]I love those cookies! Who baked those? I think I ate the Hermit's place. It was amazing anyway, even though it smelled swampy with grassy texture (I think I read swamp next to the Hermit's name). By the way, Taylor (DC) or maybe Jessa, what are you doing there? I can't even enumerate those Houses except Darlings.I read the book slowly so that I can answer the discussion's questions and because of my hope to attend the discussion early, I was so disappointed that I'm late, no, I missed the whole discussion. Overall, I like the Jellicoe Road and I will always treasure it even I find other Marchetta's works better. This will always reminds me of you, the wicked in the outside but nice in the inside. It's like exchanging those songs but I use books to describe you and super thanks for sharing such nice song for me.

There are 2 story lines in this book that alternate, past and present. They come together to reveal the mystery behind Taylor's identity and family history. The way Melina wrote the story was very confusing for the first half of the book. She jumps right in without explanation and you get so much thrown at you that it's hard to process it all. I've read and enjoyed books written like this before, but this one took a bit too long to get some answers and by then I had forgotten a few details. Everything does come together at the end though.The plot itself is very emotional and dense with a touch of mystery added. Though I didn't really care for the \"war games\" going on at the school. It was poorly explained and I found it was pointless as it was in the story but nothing was really done with it. Like an after-thought. The characters were well constructed.

But for me it wasn\u2019t only confusing, it was also messy, pointless and absolutely ridiculous once you know what the story is really about.The author uses the first half of the book focusing on just one element of the story and because it\u2019s so intense, you are lead to think that it\u2019s the central storyline of the book and yet it actually turns out to mean basically nothing when it comes to the bigger picture; an inside joke between some of the characters , Yes, It has some sentimental value but that\u2019s it.\n\nIt's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know how to feel about that, Because the author wasted half of her material on basically nothing when she have so many things to depict and portray like the loss of a loved one, grief, survival guilt and abandonment issues. Yes, the story once it gets going is deeply sad and moving but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s written or executed well; The story after all deals with sensitive issues that I\u2019m not immune to. If someone in the street tries telling a sad story and you feel for it and it affects you, it doesn\u2019t mean he/she is a great storyteller, it just means you\u2019re having a proper human reaction to something that will upset anyone.Also the transition from the first half to the second is so jarring, It doesn\u2019t give you time to well adjust and to connect to the characters and what\u2019s happening to them.\n\nHold my hand because I might disappear\n\nSpeaking of the characters; expect the main one who\u2019s well written and fleshed out; the others are simply there, they\u2019re not complex, they don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s for them and they felt flat to me.\n\nMaybe memories should be left the way they are\n\nThe book alternates between 2 timelines that are connected somehow. I was invested way more to the past timeline, I thought it was engaging, deeply touching but rushed and neglected. I think if the book was split equally between the two timelines, I would\u2019ve been completely in love with it. Everything about the past storyline was convincing and believable and it made me feel deeply for the characters while the present timeline felt unconvincing, confusing and not well executed. \n\nGrief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for. \n\nI\u2019m really upset because I wanted to love this book and I expected it to be a new favorite of mine and it could\u2019ve been but here we are , Maybe I\u2019m missing some hidden meaning in that first half that would make all of it worth it, maybe I\u2019m not getting it the way I should. But all I know is I didn\u2019t love the book and honestly the difference between how much I wanted to and how much I don\u2019t is making me feel miserable.But take my review with a grain of salt, I was buddy-reading this book with 4 other amazing friends and they all loved it, I think they gave it all 5 stars so I think even though it didn\u2019t appeal to me that much, It could be a favorite for others", "num_likes": 12, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2019", "buddy_read", "literary-fiction"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/153694754", "review_id": "153694754", "date": "Mar 11, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Kristy", "user_url": "/user/show/2705039-kristy", "text": "Street corner TBR challenegeApril #3 per Nic.

Yes, I said it.I don't think this book deserved the 2009 Printz. Not when the The Hunger Games was published that year. But I don't think Going Bovine and A Step from Heaven deserved the Printz either. The Printz is supposed to be the teen equivalent of the Newberry Award. This isn't YA. It has teenagers in it, but it isn't YA. I can't see teenagers enjoying it like they might enjoy Looking for Alibrandi, which in my opinion is the superior book. But I've realized that the Printz Award is awarded to books that adults wish teens would read, not necessarily those that they would enjoy. I'm not saying that Twilight should have gotten the 2006 Printz. Rather, I wish this book hadn't been marketed as YA, because it isn't.It took me two months to finish it. The first 100 pages are very difficult to read through the first time around. I can't imagine most teens finishing the book, let alone getting past the first chapter. The story doesn't pick up until 1/3rd of the way through. Pacing is a major issue. Honestly, I wouldn't have finished this if I hadn't read Marchetta's debut. And the unabashed praise surrounding Marchetta was also persuaded me to stick through to the end. As a protagonist, Taylor is functional. She's neither brilliant nor depressing. She just exists, and I guess that's part of the problem. She doesn't have a well pronounced voice. Jossie, from Looking for Alibrandi, had a voice. Taylor has a whisper. She isn't memorable, which is why I wasn't running to finish Jellicoe.I didn't like Jonah Griggs. I heard some of you scream in anguish. Sorry, but it's true. Sure, he was throwing himself a constant pity party, and he was supposed to be ridiculously handsome, but I didn't like him. Much like I didn't like Jacob in Looking for Alibrandi, I didn't like Jonah Griggs. Their romance was kind of bleh. Their relationship rubbed me the wrong way.The inter-weaved plot lines didn't work for me. I would have rather Marchetta focused on either Taylor or Hannah. Both didn't work for me. Also, the family plot line and the territory plot line were a random fit. What did one have to do with the other? Favorite character: Either Ben, Chaz, or Sam. Sam's story, and consequently Taylor's backstory, was really grating. I would have rather the novel focused on them. That, I thought, was sad, not Jonah's tragic abuse story. I hate when characters are excused for their actions because of their tragic pasts. 2.5 stars. This wasn't for me.

As a travel buddy, this book kept me awake. It failed to bore me long enough to leave it inside my bag. In fact, as I was trekking the mountains of Mambukal, I can't help but look for my own Jellicoe road, the type where the canopies of the nearby trees form a tunnel. The type where I would set my eyes on the five friends bonded by fate. Sadly, my gaze did not meet anyone with the eyes that seemed to belong to Narnie but it did not lack smiles through which for a brief moment I connected with. As days crept on, so did my curiosity for these five friends who, I believe are the real heroes and heroines of this novel. This is their history, present and future. Everything that made Jellicoe Road rich in amusing events and games were created by these fab five. Their presence have etched too deep into the hearts of the townpeople including the police, the mayor and etcetera that their lives seemed to eveolve aroudn them. Taylor, the supposed heroine of this story stood out as an important link in the completion of their fate. It felt like I prowled into Taylor's diary who was then retracing her heritage to cope with her identity crisis and occasionally bumping into those entries where she wrote about her crush/lover. I guess, if Marchetta did not explore the story of these five friends, Taylor's diary would be common.This is readable and enjoyable.

That\u2019s the trouble when I read stories discussing the issues of teenagers. Good thing this book talked about values of friendship and family, or else I couldn\u2019t find anything good to like about this book. I can imagine negative comments on this review, and yeah, bring it on.What I don\u2019t like in the story:The reader will be introduced to the territory wars between the Townies and the Cadets, through the story telling of Taylor Markham. That is where most of the story will revolve. I don\u2019t appreciate that part of the story; it\u2019s like a stupid scheme to be implemented in a boarding school. I know it\u2019s hard for me to relate on that side of the story since I didn\u2019t get to live in a boarding school, but I\u2019ve heard enough of the territory wars, even the small scale one. It may be a good component to a new storyline, but to be reading numerous chapters just to discuss about territory wars, which doesn\u2019t have any strategic ideas against the other troop, only a story of falling in love with the enemy is tiring. It\u2019s like I want to pull the hairs of the girls and pinch the boys on their sides to tell them to be serious on their business, and studies.Taylor will eventually search for her guardian, Hannah, which somehow confused me. She doesn\u2019t seem to mind the existence of Hannah, so what\u2019s with the sudden eagerness to find her? I think Taylor\u2019s character is too dysfunctional that her emotional attachment to Hannah is as confusing as her character. It can be said that she\u2019s trying to keep herself detached from anyone, but I hope she showed a little heart since she\u2019s speaking in the story. It could be a positive side to the story telling, but I find it annoying. I know it\u2019s only me.A boy in the tree, the Hermit, the Brigadier, Hannah, Jonah Griggs, the serial killer, Santangelo, the Prayer Tree, the Club house, the territory wars. They are all put together to create twist and confusion to the story, which eventually will be put in order as the story unfolds. Sounds exciting, it sounds thrilling, a page-turner one can say, but I say annoying, and trying-hard. I think the author tried too hard to put confusing aspects of the story to put suspense and mystery. It\u2019s a good factor in the story telling, but I think it wasn\u2019t written at the right place and time. I don\u2019t know, I may be wrong, but that is what I feel. Throw stones on me now.Taylor\u2019s coldness and stiffness annoyed me more. Her character is too cold, inside and out, that it\u2019s kind of hard to understand her interest on other people\u2019s business. Her concern on Hannah looks fake, and her falling in love with the enemy is stupid. She is also so eager to find her real parents, but her emotion was too shallow to understand her purpose.See, it\u2019s hard for me to appreciate stories written about teenagers. I know I\u2019m talking like I wasn\u2019t a teenager once, but I am confident to say I wasn\u2019t as annoying and stupid as these characters.What I like about the story:If I don\u2019t like Taylor, then what three stars are for? It\u2019s for the story of friendship and value of family that the story tackled.Italicized portion of the book will introduce the reader to another story. One may find it confusing, but only if you would not pay much attention to the early part of the story. Honestly, I like the italicized part better than the story of Taylor and her dysfunctional leadership in the territory wars.The italicized part is not just any story of a manuscript but a story taking account of one of the character\u2019s story. I must say that part is well written and thank goodness to this part, the rest of Taylor\u2019s silly storytelling was put in order. This part talks about the friendship of 5 friends from the boarding school, who originally started the territory wars. So, yes, it explains the silly territory wars the group of Taylor is engage into. The five friends were united by the accident in Jellicoe Road, and a friendship tight enough to keep them together started. The 5 friends experienced different issues in their younger years, but they remained supportive of each other. They grew up, lived a life away from each other but their lives are still tangled altogether. Their friendship keeps them connected at one point to another. And that is what I appreciate in this story. I remember my friends, and the unwritten rule of loyalty we once made. I remember the faces of my good friends who\u2019ve been my confidantes since grade school, my close friends from the teenage years, and those I met in the University. This part of the book is close to my heart. It\u2019s a rare gem to find friends who will stay with you up to the end. The friends who will remain by your side to lift you up when you\u2019re down. And the italicized part didn\u2019t fail to convey that heartwarming message of friendship and importance of family.I feel the need to acknowledged Manchetta\u2019s effort to intertwine the story of 5 friends to Taylor\u2019s own story. There are twist and turns, suspense and intrigued, and practically the end eventually justified the means. Though I still can\u2019t help but hope that Taylor\u2019s character was given more depth, and I know there\u2019s a better way to tell us the connection of the 5 friends and Taylor\u2019s life. I really find the emotions I feel for Taylor\u2019s character were too shallow, for me to even appreciate her existence to the storyline.", "num_likes": 8, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["the-child-in-me"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/198098946", "review_id": "198098946", "date": "Aug 13, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "K", "user_url": "/user/show/13779-k", "text": "Hmm. Little accidental foray into the YA world for me, and my feelings are mixed.I see why it can feel satisfying to gradually piece together a story from a set of ambiguous puzzle pieces; for me, though, it's a style that often makes me feel alienated. I usually like to be grabbed immediately and to feel like I'm living inside the book, not to find myself scratching my head and saying, \"What's happening here?\" And because I'm like that I often end up detaching from books like these and failing to figure things out, as much out of emotional distance as out of the book's actual ambiguity. Occasionally, though, the style works for me and I feel really brilliant for having solved the puzzle and satisfied that I stuck with the book. This particular experience fell right in the middle of those two poles. What appears to be the main plotline of the book is pretty unclear at first, and is interspersed with insets from an even murkier subplot where you really have no idea who's talking or what's happening. Of course, the two stories are connected and the hows and whys of that gradually unfold -- a little too gradually for my taste. To the book's credit, though, I did stick with it and was rewarded -- mostly -- by increasing clarity after the halfway point or so. I might reread it and appreciate it more the second time around, if I cared enough to do so.I will say that the plot, once it finally unfolded, was pretty brilliant. Some of the characters and their dilemmas were interesting, although I never really felt like I knew any of them well. The romance was a bit too crafted for my tastes; the guy was that oh-so-perfect balance of tough and sensitive, macho yet emotionally available for the heroine. Yawn.

Not issues like who she's going to go to the dance with, nor like contemplating the next move in the chess game she's about to win, by the way. These are deep-seated issues, like looking for a mother in the drugged figure who changes her name every time they move, or facing a terrible lonesomeness amongst people she doesn't quite know to be a friend or a foe.This is a book that doesn't seem like a book.

This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side. Really, it's quite the emotional roller coaster - it will make you cry, laugh, cuss and dream, all in the same page.Essentially, this isn't a book that invites you to keep those rose-colored glasses on. This is a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. { Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like a very personal journal of a girl, trying in vain to keep herself sane. There is here some talk of the most sensitive subjects: teenage pregnancy, drugs, poverty, prostitution, murder, depression. These are, however, merely mentioned in course as seemingly everyday objects - which, in truth, they are. { This may also serve as a reminder that it never hurts to look twice at the dark alley or the sleeping figure on the train; they may very well be linked to us in a way we may never know. }However, as bleak as the world seems, Marchetta does offer us something to hold on to.

To see those little behaviors and feelings that used to be how I operated and felt suddenly made me understand that what I was going through, while I was in the same stage as Taylor (though, of course, not of her circumstances!), was not as unique as I thought. I wasn't alone in that sense, though I felt back then that I was.

I've had years to marinate over the (nearly) unanimous love for this book. It has a tendency to raise expectations, you know. So maybe if I'd read it years back, I wouldn't have found it good, emotionally effective, but a bit disappointing.The first 100 or so pages were kind of a slog. I very nearly checked out more than once. I simply wasn't interested in the turf wars between Boarders, Townies, and Cadets. It all seemed so silly, so entirely overblown, that something that lasts only a few weeks would have such an incredibly high importance for everyone involved. It's not like these are rival schools, just across town, not entirely. The Cadets are only in town for about two months a year and surely have other things to do with their time. Rivalry made sense, but elaborate decade and a half wars with treaties and maps? Just kind of silly, and not terribly interesting. I only kept reading because I found myself becoming invested in Taylor despite myself. I got entirely caught up in her voice, in her emotions, and in wanting to see things turn out better for her. That, I think, is where this book really shines. And not just when it comes to Taylor herself. The teenage characters in this book all feel so real, and Marchetta put in serious effort in developing them to be so. And so I kept reading, to the point where the plot became bearable, just because I kind of loved these characters in a story that I didn't care about at all.I sometimes complain about a lack of actually present adult role models, and that's rarely more true than it is here. But I generally forgive the book for that, because that very absence is sort of a plot point, instead of a convenient device. Taylor's personality has been molded by her mother abandoning her at a young age, and by not having a true substitute parental figure in her life at all. Hannah is the closest thing she has to an adult who cares for her on a personal level, and she's always kept her at arm's length and vanishes at the beginning of the book. (view spoiler)[Seriously, Hannah, what the hell? I get that Taylor's mother specifically asked her not to be a mother to her, but there's no reason she couldn't have been an aunt. And there's also no reason for her to put the vague wishes of Taylor's absent, drug addicted mother over the very real needs of her young niece. I'm so sad for Taylor that the one person entrusted to care for her still wasn't able to put her first. (hide spoiler)] So yes, while it's a trope that I'm a little sick of, it was used very well here.I do wonder if reading this sooner might have made me feel a little more forgiving towards those first 100 pages.

I have titled her as the Queen of Feels and Destruction. I know my rating for this book suggests otherwise, I did enjoy this book. It was my least favorite out of all the books I have read by her, though. Let me explain.First of all, I did not understand Taylor Markham. Reading her narrations felt like I needed her to explain more about how she felt towards her problems. There was a lack of a voice in her. With Marchetta's other female characters, I understood their frustration or their anger towards something, but with Taylor I felt like she was a brick wall. I didn't like her at times because she acted like such a stone cold bitch with her friends and Jonah. I just could not relate to her. And a lack of personality in her also did not help. I also did not enjoy the interweaving plots with Taylor's story and Hannah's. Not only was I utterly confused (because I am a very slow human being), I was just aggravated at the times where I needed to read Hannah's manuscript about the five kids on the Jellicoe Road. I skipped those parts, to be honest. I was just not interested, and that may have completely destroyed my understanding of the book, but oh well... I just did not have the patience to jump back and forth from past to the present.Lastly, the pacing was a bit off at times. Sometimes the book went slowly and then it soared. What I did enjoy about the book were the characters. Jonah, Chaz, and Raffy were such sweethearts. They were great friends to Taylor! I loved their backgrounds and I did not feel as though Marchetta left any of them out when it came to character development. I appreciated that. I also enjoyed the beautiful writing, though that is not a surprise when it comes to Marchetta. Her writing is perfection. Overall, I could not handle the feels at many parts of this book. Hell, I cried reading the prologue, and the story didn't even start at that time. I realized. Do you guys ever categorize authors when you pick up their books multiple times? Like, great, I already know this book will shatter my feels forever. Melina Marchetta IS that author. She rips open your heart and forces you to read, paying attention to every character and every heartbreak. I get a sick feeling sometimes when I read her stories and I hate that.

Marchetta has a way of writing that lulls you in even when you're not quite sure where it is she's taking you. There are sentences that are startling and brilliant in their clarity and impact, and cause me to shed a few of those cup full of tears.Jellicoe Road is definitely not the kind of book I'd normally read or enjoy. I think I'm just a bit too old and set in my ways of liking a more \"comfortable\" read. When I do venture into the rough waters of loss, pain and anger, I generally prefer my books to be of the non-fiction variety a-la the prose of one of my favorite emotional scab-picker-authors, Rick Bragg. But I do see the appeal of Marchetta to the younger generation of reader like my girl who likes it deep, dark and angsty.", "num_likes": 6, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["2011-reads", "ya"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3601844606", "review_id": "3601844606", "date": "Oct 22, 2020", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Ms. B", "user_url": "/user/show/4718375-ms-b", "text": "What a wild ride!

I feel like I\u2019m confessing a crime. I don\u2019t want to say it, I cringe thinking about it, but I can\u2019t just change how I feel. I\u2019m realizing that I am in the minority of people who didn\u2019t absolutely love this book that had them gasping with wracking sobs. Hence, I feel like people are eying me with some distaste or confusion. So, here it is, my confession: I couldn\u2019t love this book. I know what you\u2019re thinking. How could you not? This book is stunning, breathless, heartbreaking. It had me weeping, and I finished the book in utter awe at the story and how Marchetta orchestrated it, and the characters that just stole into my heart with their heartbreaking stories. Are you just emotionless and don\u2018t know a good story when it hits you in the face? No, I\u2019m not, this story just didn\u2019t captivate me the way other stories I love do. Stories like The Girl with Glass Feet and Heart's Blood. But while those stories that I treasure are not meant for everyone, Jellicoe Road isn\u2019t for everyone. Sadly, this is the case for me.Now, I didn\u2019t hate the book. No, I didn\u2019t. Honestly, I liked it. But that\u2019s it. I just liked it. It wasn\u2019t earth shattering, or stunning. It didn\u2019t make me breathless, or make me cry. I so wanted to love it. I\u2019ve read so many glowing reviews about it that I was so sure it would be a beautiful, poignant story that I would love utterly. And I tried to love it. I tried to feel with the characters, to understand them, to love the writing and appreciate where Marchetta was going with it all. But I could never quite latch onto that enchantment. I think it was the writing that stilted the story for me. I didn\u2019t really care for it. It is unique, and I love when authors can find their own, original voice that differentiates them from the rest of the writers out there, so I give her props for having a distinct voice. Her writing style does have a certain charm to it, I can see it, I just never quite felt it. It seemed a little weird and random at times. As a result, the characters never did reach into my heart very far. Yes, there were times when I felt for them, when I yearned with them and wanted them to find their story and past and figure out how knowing would make them a better, stronger person, but they didn\u2019t cry out to me with heartfelt emotion.And I had a difficult time actually getting into the story. It took almost 3/4ths of the book before I become really intrigued and felt more emotion from the characters and felt my heart melt just a little. The beginning was confusing, but then it started making a little more sense, and I became intrigued. I can see why so many people love Jellicoe Road. There are beautiful, heartbreaking moments in it, that perhaps if the writing was different, I would feel them more. It is an intriguing story, with honest, real characters, and an original plot that twisted and jumped, keeping you guessing. There were sweet, tender moments that made me smile. There were lovely moments that made my heart bloom a little with love and a subtle contentment. But those feelings didn\u2019t last long enough to cement in my heart solidly. Journeying with the Jellicoe Road was interesting, confusing at times, it had it\u2019s sweet moments, but it had it\u2019s dull moments. This story will captivate many, I just wasn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s sad, but true. I would still like to read Marchetta\u2019s other books, the urge just isn\u2019t pressing. I would say though to those who have yet to read this book, when you read it, read it for yourself, make the journey with the characters, press on through the slow beginning, and you may just love it.

I read the five stars glowing reviews about this book. I push through the first hundred pages even though I was confused and lost because I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to experience for myself what the hype was all about.Yet it just didn't do it for me. Marchetta got me at the prologue. She reeled me in but then she lost me at chapter one. She left me there by myself and I found trying so hard to sort out the two point of views and the whole game between the territory and what is actually going on in the book.It is not any means a bad read. The way Marchetta writes is so simple that I think readers don't realize how well her words flow together or how pretty they are.There are quotes like this in the book\"When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don\u2019t know who is breathing for [whom], but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don\u2019t know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already.\" and quotes like this \"It\u2019s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that\u2019s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It\u2019s not the pain they\u2019re getting over, it\u2019s the love.I mean it takes massive talent to just write like that, the way she can produce something so simple to something so lyrical.The thing is that, it was too little too late for me with this book because I found myself wanting to quit halfway but I pushed through wanting to understand all of the hype and love for this book. I want to know where the story was actually leading. But being lost for half the book left me annoyed, frustrated and not being able to connect with the characters or really care to be quite honest.The thing with me is that the writers have to be able to pull me in, either by the plot within the first hundred pages or with the characters. This book gave me neither. I was just kind of relief and happy by the end that I was able to pull through this book without quitting. I would've dock this book off another star if not for the ending. The way she was able to wrap up the story and weaved the two storylines together was handled really nicely. But to tell you that this book moved me would be a lie.

On The Jellicoe Road and I started off pretty badly. I had borrowed this book from the library 2 months before and never got motivated to finish it. When I realised my due date was coming up, I decided to pick this up. It was terribly confusing at first, and I honestly could not be any more bored by the story.I didn't understand the correlation between the two stories that were being told at the same time. I couldn't separate what was real and what was fake. (Helpful hint: Some parts of the story are Hannah's manuscript. If you're reading the ebook then it means that the parts completely italicized are the manuscript. The rest is Taylor's story).However, Melina Marchetta had a beautiful and surreal way of writing. You couldn't help but feel as if you were in Jellicoe Road and walking through the forrest and climbing the trees.

Taylor was annoying and selfish at times. She was standoffish most of the time and her \"devil may care\" attitude will get on your nerves once you start warming up to the side characters. You may think the story is slow, and yes, I won't lie. It is a pretty slow story. However once the manuscript and Taylor's life intersect, that's when I was passing the pages as fast as I could.I formed an emotional attachment to everyone in this book (yes, even Taylor once I got to know her). I sighed and swooned over Jonah Griggs and the Brigadier. I cried my eyes out while following Taylor on this journey.I think that this is one of those books that it is perfectly acceptable to re-read if you had a bad relationship with it at first. You\u2019ll be sure to fall in love with it.Overall, while it had a shaky start and a questionable main character, this book presents two stories and brings them together in a very poetic and feel-inducing way.

I don't think I've been that confused since I read The Maze Runner for the first time when I was too young to understand what the heck was going on. The author just throws you into this weird menagerie of terminology and switching back and forth between italicized and regular (as regular as this book can get) chapters. I didn't start really understanding this book until two hundred pages in, which is almost half way.Although I was left confused for almost 50% of this book, I am still giving this book four stars for a couple reasons:1) It's the best I've read by Marchetta. I have to give it a better rating than the other ratings I've given her books because of that sole fact. I've read both Saving Francesca and The Piper's Son, and neither of them blew me away despite their high Goodreads ratings. I found the prior to be boring, depressing, and I just felt very disconnected from the book as a whole. The latter was a little more interesting, but it still felt a little long for the lackluster plot, and the disconnect was still there. This one was different from those two because this one is a mystery instead of just a contemporary about realistic issues. Mysteries are some of my favorite books out there, so I definitely feel like that's part of the reason that this one was more enjoyable for me.2) The ending really comes together. It's really impressive how the two stories are brought together and everything is connected. It's obvious that Marchetta put a lot of thought and work into forming this story. It definitely takes some time to put two and two together, but I would strongly suggest not DNFing this book because the ending really saves the book and brought this book up from two stars to four stars.3) Taylor's character. Actually all of the characters were so genuine, and I felt for them all. I didn't feel much of anything for her characters I've read about before. I really connected with how Taylor felt the most though. Not in the sense that her mother left her when she was eleven or her going to a school for delinquents, but in how she viewed the world around her.\n\"So explain to me again what I did wrong.\"I don't stop. \"You know what? You didn't do anything wrong. I did. It's this dumb thing I do. I look into things ad see more than I'm supposed to.\nI really liked her character, but I also liked the relationships between them. Raffy and Taylor's friendship was adorable, and I loved how Raffy always had faith in Taylor's authority even when she didn't agree with her. I didn't love Jonah Griggs as much as all of the other people on Goodreads, but the part where Griggs reveals what he was planning to do at the train station really broke my heart and formed a soft spot inside of me for him. 4) Unique story. You all know I'm a sucker for anything that I haven't read before, especially in YA. There are so many overused tropes and recycled ideas that I feel lucky when I stumble upon a story that is fresh and new. That is Jellicoe Road. As weird as it is, it's still refreshing and I loved trying to figure it out.If I had any complaints, I wish there would be a map of some sort that would clarify the territories of each faction. If there were a little more explanation of the whole situation at the beginning instead of just capitalizing words and confusing the reader into probably setting this book down (which I might have done if I didn't have a thing against DNFing). Other than the confusion on top of confusion, I think this book is those who are tired of the same old in YA should definitely pick up. It will definitely blow your mind when everything begins to come together.", "num_likes": 3, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-2016", "mystery-thriller-suspense", "revisit"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1359848609", "review_id": "1359848609", "date": "Aug 10, 2015", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Hafshie", "user_url": "/user/show/14145399-hafshie", "text": "\n\u201cAnd life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you\u2019re watching someone die.\u201d\nThroughout the story I\u2019m thinking that this novel is what happens when you combine Veronica Roth, Gillian Flynn, John Green, Sarah Dessen, and Melina Marchetta\u2019s novels. The territory wars and the factions seems like the divergent series. The mystery in the story may seem like that of Gillian Flynn and John Green\u2019s. The family issues seems to come from Sarah Dessen\u2019s . If I weren\u2019t so keen as to observe the publication date I would have thought that Ms. Marchetta was inspired by the aforementioned writers in writing this story.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The story is a bit of a chaos at first. I was inexplicably confused. I have asked myself so many times, \u2018are they still on earth?\u2019, 'Is this another version of the Divergent series?' The story was totally confusing at first. Then, I was glad I found my bearings after three to four chapters. I tried so hard to understand Taylor\u2019s explanation of what\u2019s going on with her life. The past (the stories that Hannah wrote) and the dream that Taylor\u2019s always having are additional confusion to the story. I even skipped some of it just to get to the story further which actually not a good idea if you really want to solve the mystery yourself. And I suggest you do that because that\u2019s the thrill. I think that\u2019s the reason why the author wrote it that way. You should attempt to solve the mystery for your reading to be more exciting. But to be honest, what hooked me to the story was the romance building between Taylor and Jonah. They\u2019re supposed to be enemies! But somehow they\u2019ve got history, which is one of the interesting parts in the story.That\u2019s what heightened my interest on the story.Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t very thrilled with the mystery part. I hated that some people stick to their misery even if their loved ones are being dragged to it. It\u2019s like selfishness. If they just told Taylor everything about her life, things wouldn\u2019t have been so difficult for her. Why is it that some people choose to hide things from someone even though they know that person will always find ways to know what lies behind the mask and the deafening silence or the things left untold? They\u2019re just making things difficult for everyone. Sometimes, while I was reading this, I wish this book is just about fighting territories between the factions. But now I'm thinking that I'm silly for thinking that. 'Cause I know it would be boring.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The book has left me pondering how some parents make decision in life that put their child's life into a mess. Some people blame their parents for their misery but as some humans are ever so curious as to why they have that kind of life, they find ways to trace the paths back to their past. It seems silly because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re really looking for but their lives won\u2019t ever be complete unless they found the answers they so eager to find. What\u2019s a relief, is when they found out that their parents have made the right decision for them. There\u2019s no regret in here because,we can\u2019t change the past. Past is past and moving on seems to be the right decision. But as they say, until we make peace with our past, the future seems to be a blur.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Rating: 3 confusing stars  -because I used the word 'confuse' and its other form 3x...

'Jellicoe Road' is another book I look back on with not much fondness, and I am no longer comfortable with it being on my bookshelf. Maybe I think it's pretentious, overly contrived and melodramatic (ironic, since there isn't much of a plot to speak of, or remember, and why you should care.) Melodramatic yet detached from the characters' emotions and situations. Cynical yet silly, now there's a paradox. The book is not even magical realism, but it reads like it. Like, the main character is psychic, and has prophetic dreams? And dreams of what happened when she was little more than a baby, and before she was born - dreams of meeting people who died before she was born, but she knows them so well - what? Add in the fact that, for her seemingly perfect memory, even of traumatic events, she has repressed memories of things that are convenient for the book's weak mystery \"plot\" to work.I'll never forgive the line of dialogue about Anne Frank: \"The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying.\" THIS IS SAID ABOUT A HOLOCAUST VICTIM. A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HOLOCAUST VICTIM. Even though it's said by a teenage boy, he isn't called out on it. It's sexist, and in incredible bad taste. It's vile. Most of the characters are unlikable, and all of the adults, as I've said before, are crap, even for YA.So, unable to defend it now, and in spite of its popularity and high praise, I wipe my hands clean of 'Jellicoe Road' for good. Perhaps it's overrated, not that great, or it hasn't aged well. The same could be said for most if not all of Melina Marchetta's YA novels.Original review:Right. Here goes nothing:'Jellicoe Road' has soooo much hype surrounding it, and for good reason. Even though I'd read a lot of positive Goodreads reviews before picking it up and reading, I kept my expectations fairly low. It still surprised me.'Jellicoe Road' is a fantastic and fascinating novel, full of memorable and distinctive characters and scenes - an enriching mixture that just makes you choke up. Like with nearly all books by Melina Marchetta, it has quotable passages and lines of dialogue on almost every page, and they're poignant and beautiful. How Ms Marchetta comes up with all of these life philosophies, I don't know. And it amazes me. I think I love the setting the most, which is a boarding school in the woods, like a summer camp only secretly full of brutal teens fighting and kidnapping each other for territory purposes. And there's a \"Prayer Tree\". Treehouses are adorable!It is certainly not your typical YA romance story either. There's much more depth to it than that.However... It's not perfect. I'll try listing the things I didn't like about this novel:1. The adults are crap. Really, there's no other word to describe them. Yes, I understand why they're crap - tragic childhood and never learning to grow up emotionally - but the decisions they make don't make sense to me. I won't reveal what those decisions are due to spoilers, but it has something to do with a pet-peeve I have about adult guardians keeping important secrets from their kids for no good reason. Emotional scarring or not, if you love and trust your children then they have a right to know the truth. Knowing nothing will most likely hurt and confuse them more than knowing something. The secret-keeping is there to add mystery to the plot, but most of the mysteries are rather obvious anyway and I found them to be a little too contrived, even with the emotional backing.2. Some characters had to grow on me long into the story before I could like them, such as Jonas Griggs and Taylor, believe it or not. But I liked characters such as little Jessa, Raffy and the tragedy-stricken but playful kids in flashbacks. Taylor I found to be too aggressive and selfish from the first chapter, but once I grasped her takes-no-shit ways (and she truly doesn't take any shit), and her unconscious desperation to know who she is and why her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road, I found her hard not to love and respect as a protagonist. Her life sucks, and she adapts to it by the only means she knows how (especially with irresponsible and thoughtless adults around making it worse).3. Santangelo's comment about Anne Frank on page 216 of my copy: \"The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying.\" (I wonder if he'd say that if Anne Frank had been a boy. I doubt it.) But I'm sure this is somehow a compliment in context to the conversation he's having with Taylor and the Jellicoe gang, as he then says, \"it was like nothing could kill what was inside of her\". The character interactions in this book feel realistic and help shape the setting, by the way.4. The ending, while dramatic, is contrived. It is a pay-off of sorts to something only mentioned a few times throughout the book, and it didn't quite work for me. But it didn't turn out too badly. Because the next, not-so-theatrical pay-off - and climax - is a heart-wrenching conclusion to Taylor's story about self-discovery and what it means to have people around who love her.I could talk more about of the contrivances in the story, whether or not they are spoilery. However I do not want to put anybody off reading this novel, despite a few minor issues I had with it that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5.And I do feel bad about not giving 'Jellicoe Road' 5 stars, because it did have a profound effect on me emotionally and mentally, and Ms Marchetta is a genius. I guess the number of things that annoyed me were one too many.But I do really, really like it. It's a beautiful, wondrous story about maturity, family, friendship, the importance of memories and childhood, and the strength to change. It's a puzzle of a coming-of-age tale about one unique teen, Taylor Markham. The other characters and their lives are also unique, and add substance to the plot and the way it's structured. Imperfect people make up the heart of the story of 'Jellicoe Road', melodramatic or no.'Jellicoe Road' is one of those books that leaves you feeling so much that you don't know what to do after finishing it. It is tender-hearted despite its dark themes, and it is as funny as it is sad and shocking. Ms Marchetta has a gift of making you emotional from reading her writing, regardless of the premise or content. It may not be my number one favourite book of hers (which is still 'Finnikin of the Rock') - like it is for so many other readers - but there is definitely something special in this. I overall enjoyed the journey on the Jellicoe Road.Final Score: 4/5", "num_likes": 2, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult", "romance", "tear-jerker", "mysticism-of-life", "mystery", "gritty"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3297817820", "review_id": "3297817820", "date": "Jan 17, 2021", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Piensa En Libros", "user_url": "/user/show/93386226-piensa-en-libros", "text": "No s\u00e9 ni como empezar a escribir mi opini\u00f3n sobre este libro.

The premise of this story isn't established as effectively as it could have been. There's a good chunk of the book in which very little is explained, or is not explained well.For me, this book's biggest downfall is that, while the events of the story make dramatic sense in building the plot up to the climax and all of that, they weren't necessarily \"full-proof.\" What I mean by that is that this story has a lot of potential for plotholes. Many things are left unsaid, and many things the reader may believe he or she understands are disregarded often.The main character, Taylor, was (obviously) the most well-written character of the bunch, and I sympathized with her struggle to understand where she belonged and why her mother abandoned her. She was what pulled me through the story, because I wanted to go on this emotional journey with her and understand her life alongside her. However, many of the side characters fell flat for the sake of that journey, I felt. I didn't understand the basis for her relationship with Jonah Griggs, and I was left unmoved by their consequent romance (which felt a tad rushed, despite having some backstory). Rather, earning about Taylor's past, and the way it's revealed bit by bit, is what makes this book memorable, not necessarily the characters themselves or their friendships. This is almost a book that you need to read twice to fully appreciate. And while I can respect that, and while I'm in awe of how the second half wholly changes the story entirely, knowing that this book practically demands two readings makes me feel a bit cheated as a reader. Had the premise(s) been better established, I think that readers would be able to get the full potential of this book with just one read-through.That being said, I really adored the latter half of this book. Melina Marchetta wrote with emotion and clear purpose, and I think it paid off in the end. I did enjoy following Taylor's story, and the way all the puzzle pieces fit together and how everything unfolded is something that I won't soon forget.

I...I guess?The book has an arresting first sentence and intriguing prologue that describes a car accident...and then it moves forward twenty-two years to a teenage girl named Taylor who was not in the prologue, and she's in a weird school in Australia, and there are territory wars between Cadets and Townies, and I don't know what the fuck is going on.We get more flashes of the characters in the prologue. How are they connected to the present-day action? WHO KNOWS.Taylor is a perfectly likable character, but she definitely does not care whether the reader understands what's going on, especially because she doesn't know some of it. She makes references to various events in her past, but her own past is mysterious to her. She has weird dreams about a boy in a tree, she doesn't know her mother or father, she...there is just a lot of mystery here.The problem is that I was given almost no grounding to care about anyone or anything beyond wanting to know what was going on. The territory wars baffled me, making me think this was a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world (spoilers, it's not), and I couldn't connect to most of the characters.Halfway through the book\u2014and I mean almost literally at the 50% mark\u2014information is revealed that helped me recontextualize the narrative and understand what was going on. As Taylor discovers more about her past, I was certainly more engaged, but even then, Melina Marchetta's writing style may not be my thing, as dramatic revelations sometimes went uncommented on, and I still didn't really care so much about the characters. I had a lot of questions about the setup, about why characters acted a certain way and didn't tell people certain things. I liked elements of the ending, though.I should like this book more than I do. I admire the narrative structure, but it does ask a lot of the reader. It's an incredibly frustrating read for half the book, and while I enjoyed the various reveals, they don't quite make up for the first half.

It is a good and inspiring story. And quite engaging too especially at the second half of the book. I love the friendship from the two generations depicted in the story. In fact, I envy that kind of friendship. I longed for someone who will stick with you through thick and thin. A friendship that you know will last forever - no matter what happens. The first half of the book is confusing and frustrating. The story building doesn\u2019t make any sense; it was slow and Taylor was annoying. It was boring and I almost DNFed it. At this point, I advise you not to. Just hold on to it because everything will be explained as the story progresses. The romance is sweet and true. I like the chemistry of Taylor and Jonah; Raffy and Chaz. I can\u2019t help but smile when they\u2019re together. The rest of the cast are quite good too. Raffy and Ben are so funny especially when they were teasing Taylor and Jonah. I think this is the point when I started enjoying this book. The funny bits and romantic scene kept me going until the end. The mystery about Taylor\u2019s past is intriguing but predictable. I already know what will happen next and the huge issue from the past. The drama is just too cliche and I\u2019ve seen this a lot in Pinoy drama series.

But recently Hannah has gone missing without so much as a goodbye, and Taylor is starting to suspect there's information about her past that people aren't telling her.I hadn't read any Marchetta before this book, and I'm unsure if this is her typical writing style, but it was difficult for me to follow. Marchetta doesn't spell things out of you. The story changes pace, setting, and characters frequently and without warning.Without knowing much about this book beforehand, I jumped right in, and I wasn't quite sure what I found. The territory wars seemed borderline fantasy, and Marchetta leaves the objectives and what's at stake a little vague. Is this a real war? Are these kids really fighting for their lives?You're introduced to many, many characters almost immediately and some who go by multiple names. The story alternates following two similar groups of friends -- one in present day (Taylor) and one generations before. The connection between the two, and who exactly these people are, is part of the mystery.I will admit my personal experience with this book was a confused one. It's compelling and disjointed.

And before I started I did something different as well; I\u2019ve read a lot of reviews, most of them were pointing out to have patience because the beginning is dizzy, disjointed and with too many characters which are categorised into boarders, townies and cadets.But I didn't have that big of a problem with the beginning although I was slightly annoyed because I am very ''cautious'' with YA books \u2013 especially those that have high ratings, which this one definitely has.Because I so often switch from genre to genre I give myself a right to be a sheriff and a judge in my own bookhood. I like to swoon over something and instead of being infatuated I end up being disoriented in my disbelief. I became very harsh with books \u2013 because just reading something to read, that cannot be applied to my mouth watering yearn and long lasting love affair that I will have with books till.the.end.of.my.time.la.la.la.la. So it\u2019s not the plot that slowed my reading down, but the sentences of this book were to blame. I instantly started liking Marchetta's way of expressing herself and there was this ironical attitude that Taylor had which attracted me further. I admire people with integrity who have an opinion. Without your opinion what are you left with that it counts? She writes in a way where you can see the end. Meaning, she tells a lot of things in one subject-verb-object-fullstop. Especially when he said: ''Go to hell.'' And she replied, ''Been there. Trust me, it's overrated.'' I can tell you it\u2019s overrated as well, but I never thought of it in this simple way. That\u2019s the reason why I loved this book. It was full of these short written gems that you heard before but you didn\u2019t recognise them as life savers. But this book didn\u2019t impress me how I wanted it. It had very strong moments and toward the end, I cried but what I\u2019ve learned in my life is that tears are not the expression of sadness; complete retreat into yourself and blessed numbness are. Tears will help you a great deal, they wash you over and nurture you, but no, they will not tell you how one person feels. Taylor didn't cry that much, but it was heartbreaking to read how stoical she had to be, if not, she would shatter. So while I liked Taylor and her development, not just with Jonah Griggs but dealing with overwhelmingly sad beginning of her childhood \u2013 see, this is where this book lost me completely - history and present were just too separated. Her life, but just her current life was great to read about because it was senselessly sad but I was getting annoyed because everything was tied up in the end, and I wished that the whole book was like the last 50 pages. I didn\u2019t like how clumsy antagonism between townies, cadets and boarders was described, and I sure didn\u2019t like the entire mumble jumble that happened on the Jellicoe road twenty years ago. Not the result of it, or how people dealt with that excruciating story but how Memento and Irreversible (movies) it was written. I am not talking about how confused I felt, but how it wasn\u2019t emotionally engaging as the present story was, which is a tough cookie because it could have been just it was entangled too much. On a higher scale, this book really deals with a lot of bad things \u2013 traumas of loss and abusiveness. And that makes me somehow indecisive because there are so many things that made me lull, that I found startling and touching, and then there were these whirls of shallowness, laziness and lightness, which I can't forgive this book.What I want to say is that Marchetta\u2019s books are difficult to review. Yeah, I\u2019ve written so much, but these are just words. Basic message is \u2013 read this book, in the end it will not disappoint you. Whoever you are, I guarantee you that you will find something that will be just yours because reading about happy people, where\u2019s fun in that.

I can\u2019t make up my mind about it. Despite it being pitched it as a mystery and many users tagging it as a romance, it felt like neither to me. Imo this was a coming of age story about friendship and bonds that are forged at a young age and last forever.One thing\u2019s for sure: Melina Marchetta\u2019s writing is lyrical and beautiful and captivating. \u201cI live on the Jellicoe Road. Where trees make canopies over-head and where you can sit at the top of them and see forever.\u201d Now, as for the story \u2026 there are actually 2 stories being told: the \u2018present\u2019 story and the \u2018past\u2019 story, which elicited opposite reactions from me. (The connection between them was obvious to me as a reader from almost the beginning, but for the heroine from the present it takes a journey that lasts the whole book to figure out how her life is connected to those from the past.)- I wasn't much invested in the \u2018present\u2019 story, mostly because I had trouble connecting with its heroine, Taylor. Her story was sad and I felt bad for her but I didn't really feel her pain as I would have for someone I knew and cared about. I never figured out what made her tick: what was going through her head when she acted the way she acted? And what was up with her weird dreams? The love interest, Jonah, was kind of \u201cin the shadows\u201d and for most of the book their relationship was almost non-existing. I frankly didn't feel the Taylor/Jonah love. I liked the secondary characters Raff, Chaz, Ben and Jessa a lot more than I did the MCs, but once again, they seemed barely fleshed out. I guess what I want to say is that I felt like an outsider looking into their lives but not really being a part of it. - I also didn't buy the part of the plot about the territorial wars between Townies, Cadets and Jellicoe kids. There were a lot of threats and little action. They weren't doing anything other than saying \u201cwe are at war, don\u2019t enter our turf\u201d and it seemed like they didn't accomplish much. (But I must admit that the literal \u201cshit fight\u201d made me laugh.)+ The \u2018past\u2019 story on the other hand... WOW. Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude carved a path right into my heart and took permanent residence there. They made my heart ache with tremendous joy and unspeakable sadness.I cried my heart out and then cried some more. I was left feeling raw. I wanted to pull them all into a group hug and never let them go. Every tragedy they experienced I experienced as if it were my own. Their friendship, their mutual love, their bond, was all incredibly beautiful and heat-breaking. Nostalgic. Bittersweet. Melancholic. Everlasting. Memorable. And that ending! In a nutshell: two stories were told and interwoven in this book. One I was rather indifferent to; the other I was totally invested in and loved. I wish the people from the \u2018past\u2019 story had had more page time, or even had the book all to themselves and then I would surely had rated Jellicoe Road with 5 stars.Australian slang I picked up:*Gaol=jail*Pash= heavy duty kissing between teenagers/snog.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["y-a", "2014-reads", "contemporary", "own-paper-copy", "aussie-authors", "cried-my-heart-out", "epilogue-perfection", "punch-to-the-feels", "mixed-feelings"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1895084537", "review_id": "1895084537", "date": "May 06, 2017", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Danielle (Life of a Literary Nerd)", "user_url": "/user/show/32803116-danielle-life-of-a-literary-nerd", "text": "This was the perfect example of a \u2018slow\u2019 story that isn\u2019t boring.

As the chosen leaders of the cadets, the Jellicoe school houses, and the townies respectively, it was nice to see their interactions change and evolve over the course of the story. The learn more about each other and their history and they evolve naturally. I really loved the bonding at the Prayer tree, it felt so genuine that I became completely invested in these three characters.\nThings I Didn\u2019t Like\n:I didn\u2019t really care about Raffaela at all. She felt pretty useless as a character to me. I know she has some kind of history with Santangelo that was supposed to cause drama or at least bring her into the core group, but we don\u2019t get any information to actually make me care. The side characters in general all receive virtually no information, but that\u2019s really ok because the story is more about the core group and their history and the history of Jellicoe road. But Raffaela is integrated as part of the core group, but I don\u2019t think we get enough of her to establish her on her own.The serial killer side plot fell completely flat to me. There wasn\u2019t enough information to establish is and it didn\u2019t have much closure either. It never went anywhere, it was just brought up now and again with no history or development. It was really just unnecessary and didn\u2019t add anything at all to the story.This was an enjoyable and engaging read, that builds and creates this hazy world of nostalgia and mystery. I really liked how the answers revealed themselves naturally and organically. The characters and the world are ethereal, while still being incredible grounded in emotion and humility.", "num_likes": 4, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["contemporary", "standalones"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1031436339", "review_id": "1031436339", "date": "Aug 19, 2014", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Andr\u00f3meda ", "user_url": "/user/show/15728062-andr-meda", "text": "\n\"\u2014Estoy aqu\u00ed por ti, t\u00fa eres mi prioridad.

I haven't actually read a Melina Marchetta since Looking for Alibrandi in Highschool. I loved Looking for Alibrandi. It got me through many difficult, angsty 16 year old times. Had I read Jellicoe Road in High School, I feel I would have loved it just as much.Because the thing is - Taylor is a really great main character. She's a rough around the edges, but damaged, needy girl who is able to pull out her strength when she needs it. All she realls wants is to love and be loved. The story is centred around Taylor's search for her mentor, Hannah, who has disappeared in the middle of the night to \"care for a friend\". Taylor has reason to believe that isn't true and is concerned for Hannah's safety.In the middle of the search for Hannah is the \"war\" - the school is divided up into various factions, and they have battled for years, distributing various areas of the school to the diffrent factions based on the outcomes of strategy and negotiation. People from other factions aren't really supposed to be friends, but there is definitely some emotion going on between Taylor and Jonah Griggs (who may I add, is a bit yummy.)As well as all of these concepts, the chapters are interspersed with the manuscript that Hannah is writing about 5 friends on the Jellicoe Road. And these 5 friends are starting to feel awfully familiar to Taylor.Right so - Marchetta certainly knows how to write a believeable love story. I loved Josie & Jacob in looking for Alibrandi, and I certainly loved Taylor Markham and Jonah Griggs. There is something so raw and real about them. It isn't all sunshine and lollipops - they are both seriously flawed characters who manage to bring out the best in each other.I read the book fairly quickly, because it was certainly very readable. There were a few times when I scratched my head and flicked back a few pages because I felt I had missed something, but it all came together in the end. As far as the story goes, it was pretty good. Not amazing, but I would certainly prefer to see teenagers reading this over something like Twilight.

This is because there were spots in the book where she was cruel to kids and through her actions, you could tell that she is a depressed and anxiety - prone girl. For example, Taylor was rudely sarcastic to Hannah, her mentor and guardian, \"I don't have wings, Hannah\" (Marchetta 21). It is not her fault that she is that way because her mom ditched her when she was only 11, and she only has one recollection of her father due to him dying when she was really young.

I also found the \"story\" that is set in italic and interwoven with narrative a bit disorienting until it is made clear that is Hannah's story that Taylor is reading. While some of the mysteries took a while to completely untangle, I found that I was able to discern the true identities of most of the characters a long while before the revelations within the book. Even so, the way Taylor internalizes it manages to give it extra weight and intensity.By the end, I found that the story had exceeded my initial expectations.

Griggs was the highlight of the book. I love a strong, steady hero, and he was he was solemn to boot. There was no reading between the lines with this guy; you knew what he wanted you to know. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t a fan of Taylor. It was hard for me to tell what her motivations were, and there was a point where she crossed the line for me. She was never able to come back from that. The parallel story was much more interesting than the one being told in its entirety, and I thought that was detrimental to the overall book.

It slowly unravels the mystery of a group of 5 friends who come together after a terrible accident on Jellicoe Road.It tells a tragic story of love and loss. I loved how strong Taylor was while she was trying to dig into her mother and fathers past. Even Griggs, who is the leader of the Cadet with his drill sergeant attitude, has a compassionate side that he shares with Taylor. That compassion is what helps Taylor as she goes in search to find her mother. Slowly you see how their love grows even at times when you think their relationship is over!At times I felt very confused on which characters story I was reading about. I feel that if I were to read it a second time I would understand in better detail the past of the characters more.Overall I thought that it was a good story.

A few things I liked: - Exceptionally well written. The writing style was intriguing. There were many connections and symbols. Fabulously well written.- The story delved into sobering societal issues. Not only drugs, homelessness, abandonment, and death, but also the cycle of abuse and addiction, how people handle trauma and grief and guilt, etc. - I like how the characters relied on each other and supported each other. They absolutely LOVED each other and trusted each other, like family.- I felt so deeply. I cried. I hurt. I ached. - I liked how the story unravels - revealing this connection and then that connection. With little twists and turns along the way. It was captivating.A few things that were hard for me: - If I had to use one word to describe this book it would be TURMOIL. There was so much emotional agony, chaos, damage, and trauma. It was tragic. There was still hope in the end, but if they were weighed against each other, the anguish/tragedy would outweigh the hope/joy in the book. That was hard for me. Yes, it had a happy ending but, ugh, it was so sad...- I'm not a huge fan of prickly, harsh heroines like Taylor. (Regardless of what made them that way, although that knowledge definitely helps me have patience for them.)- A few aspects of the book, although they were necessary for the plot, were unrealistic. Would Hannah really abide by (view spoiler)[Tate's request that she (Hannah) never treat Taylor like a mother would?  (hide spoiler)] That was just stupid that Hannah always kept Taylor at an arm's distance, never filling her need to be loved and nurtured, just to comply with a (view spoiler)[ drug addict's selfish request.  (hide spoiler)] True love dictates that she would raise Taylor differently. It just doesn't jive with what we know about Hannah. Also, why would Hannah keep Taylor's heritage a secret? Not tell Taylor that (view spoiler)[ she was her aunt  (hide spoiler)], that she loved Taylor and would always be there for her? Taylor was so lost and confused, and dealt with major abandonment issues. How could Hannah, who is supposed to love her so deeply, keep her in the dark and watch her flounder that way? Taylor was a tormented girl because she had NO CLUE what her story was. Sad, so sad! It was so wrong of Hannah. I don't care (view spoiler)[ what Taylor's messed up mom wanted. Tate relinquished the right to be the only mother figure for Taylor when she made the life choices she made.  (hide spoiler)] Why make Taylor suffer so? Just allow the girl to know that someone loves her for heaven's sake!- It was so sad that (view spoiler)[ Tate could not stay strong and live for her daughter.  (hide spoiler)] She dealt with her grief in such a tragic, destructive way. - I was disappointed that (view spoiler)[ Tate and Jude  (hide spoiler)] had sex when they were overcome with grief, sadness, and loneliness and were seeking relief. That is not what sex is about. It's not a way to forget. It's a way to draw closer and express love to a committed partner. That's not how it felt, though. And it was even worse when (view spoiler)[ Taylor and Jonah  (hide spoiler)] had sex. They were emotionally and physically exhausted, processing post-traumatic stress, and seeking acceptance and relief in each other. Before that, they were just starting to experiment with being with each other on friendly terms. They were just teenagers and only starting on the journey of knowing who they were and growing into themselves. They weren't mature enough for a sexual relationship. They had had a rocky, raw, harsh relationship that was just starting to have a tiny hint of sweetness, but it was still frail and suddenly having sex out of a response to emotional strain was not cool. There was just something so wrong about it. Their relationship needed to be based on mutual attraction, affection, trust, and support, and yet sometimes I felt like they were drawn together because of mutual anguish and dependency. (As an aside, I can't help but compare this to the similar situation in A Different Blue by Amy Harmon, which was handled SO MUCH better because the characters showed restraint when they knew they were under emotional strain. It was a great book, by the way.) I did not like the scene when she yells at him saying in essence, she hopes she never sees him again, and he gets in her face, livid, and says \"I'm about this close to telling you to get the @#$% out of my life\" (chapter 17, page 252). It was scary and it made me realize that they aren't really in love as much as they have a dependency on each other (this sentence doesn't even address the fact that they were teenagers, and were clearly not mature enough to know what true love looks like). Again, later on, he made a very telling remark about why he was drawn to her; I don't recall it exactly- he might have said it in frustration- but it was disturbing because it wasn't what love should be. It was the instance when she answered sarcastically, \"How romantic,\" and I think that night they had sex. Yuck. The \"romance\" in this book wasn't romantic as much as it was raw. - There were a bunch of f-words. Maybe like 10 or so? And two instances of teen sex as I mentioned above.

There's no denying she has a superb command of language, endless creativity, and the ability to rip your heart out and stomp it to pieces. When I read glowing reviews for OTJR by some of my favorite bloggers, I knew I had to read it. One click on Audible and I was suddenly whisked away to the Australian outback.  So what exactly is this book about?? ~shrugs~ No review really gave much of a synopsis. A lot of posts read \"You just have to experience the plot for yourself!\" Strike one. Apparently the story is about young Taylor Markham, abandoned by her mother in a gas station when she was 11, and how she has found herself plunked down at the Jellicoe boarding school. There's also something about territory wars between her school and a couple other groups of kids, and then at one point her caretaker goes missing and Taylor tries to find her. But knowing Marchetta, there's a lot more going on to the story. There's also poignant stories of friendship, love, loss...ya know...typical YA standards. So why don't I love this story like I did Finnikin? Same themes, same drama and tragedy. For one, the book starts out insanely confusing, and then you get pieces of the puzzle in a stylish attempt to create mystery and intrigue in the story. Strike two. I was too confused to enjoy the subtleties. For another, I just didn't love the characters the same way. Other than Taylor and Griggs, the characters seemed so flat and two dimensional. It was hard for me to really allow Marchetta to rip on my heartstrings when really I just didn't care. But that could be more of a reflection on my heartlessness than her writing. And finally, I just didn't like the protagonist. Strike three. She came off as selfish and whiny, and darn it if she wasn't crying every other chapter. She was uncaring to her friends, completely self-absorbed, and not always the brightest crayon in the box. And maybe some people like that kind of protagonist. She definitely came across as human, emotional, and genuinely teenager-ish. Full marks to Marchetta for nailing that characterization. I guess I just wanted someone to root for more. But dang. Marchetta is flawless with words. Her narratives read like poetry. Her stories are real and honest. I would definitely recommend reading this one before moving on to her trilogy. I think she has since become a much more polished writer. So while this wasn't my favorite read of the year, I'm glad I gave Jellicoe a chance (if nothing else I truly enjoyed the narrator's Australian accent).

It seems true when she says it: she's 17 and has been at the Jellicoe School for years, and now she's \"the one-in-charge\" in the Territory Wars that happen for six weeks, in which students from her school face off against local kids (the Townies) and boys from a Sydney military school (the Cadets). The Jellicoe School is pretty much home for Taylor, though she also has lived in a nearby house that belongs to a woman in her early 30s named Hannah, who's been taking care of Taylor since her drug-addicted mom abandoned her in a 7-11 bathroom when Taylor was eleven. But Taylor's story isn't the only one we get: there's also a story from decades before that starts with a car crash on Jellicoe Road: we quickly learn that this other story is a book that Hannah's writing, but Taylor wonders if it's more than that, too. At the start of the book, I found the dual narratives somewhat off-putting, and had a hard time getting into the book generally: it felt like there was a lot going on and it didn't all flow together, and I wasn't really into some of the moments of magical realism. But by the end, I was sitting on my couch in tears, so I'd say Jellicoe Road won me over, magical realism and all. What makes the book work for me, mostly, is Taylor, and how she grows over the course of it. She's so closed-off when the book starts (understandably, given her childhood): she has a hard time trusting people and tells herself she isn't particularly interested in changing that. But of course that isn't totally true, and on some level she knows it. I like how we get to see Taylor becoming friends with other kids from her school, and becoming close to the leaders of the Townies and the Cadets as well (especially the leader of the Cadets, a kid named Jonah she knows from a few years back). And I like how we get to see her learning more about Hannah and her mom and the other kids who were part of their close-knit circle of friends, back when they were kids and teenagers, and how she starts to understand some things about why her mother has done the things she's done.

Some were reasonably wrapped up by the end, but it fully took me half the book before I felt invested in the outcome and I still felt annoyed by some things:1. I expected more fun hijinks and pranks in the territory war, but instead I found myself genuinely fearing for the safety of these children.2.

Again, a lot did get filled in as the story unfolded, but so much of the book just felt like unconnected pieces floating around.3. I don't think any of the adults have a valid reason to justify hiding so much information from Taylor in the way that they did, and I think she should have been more angry with them. Obviously, she has some spotted memories due some really traumatic childhood experiences, and much of the story was her discovering the connection between the past and present...but there were some needlessly massive gaps in her history. And given that that knowledge affected a lot more than just her, it's very difficult for me to reconcile.Ultimately, I just don't think this the right book for me at this moment time.

I've completely immersed myself the characters' incredibly realistic lives, facing horrors that they have been forced to behold. The psychological depth of the characters is insanely complex, which is probably the highlight of this book. Living in the heart of Sydney rather than the rural setting of Jellicoe Road, I don't think I ever understood how different the culture is there, and how people living in those areas see Sydney in such a different light. It was especially jarring to see familiar suburbs and australian jargon mentioned, especially since I had NO idea that this book was in any way australian. I have no idea how non-australian readers would get every single reference, like the school level system eg. \"year eleven\" or the popular TV show Home and Away. On a kind of unrelated note, Kings Cross is MUCH safer today, which is why I was so shocked at the description the book gave.I still have to say, the plot was very confusing even to the end, and the construction of the plot had little logical sense, even if it moved character arcs forward and clues into light. For example, the warring tribe system between the Cadets, Townies and the Houses absurdly seemed to be taken too seriously one moment and then the rules were very quickly ignored the next. There was a lack of motive and reason why characters chose to do certain things, like breaking into the Brigadier's tent and having a party at the Club House. These could almost be plot holes, but I'm willing to put them away as devices to make the story more efficient.Overall I'm rather conflicted on how to rate this.

I loved how everything came together and I loved Taylor and Jonah together. The relationships between all the characters are really amazing actually.

Let me gather my thoughts first... not to mention extra time)Okay, I actually made a review of this, but this stupid GR box deleted it, so I kind of lost interest again. Tsk.Edit 12/8/13 Disclaimer: I'm doing this in between reading breaks so review might be a little sloppy but will try my best.To start with, let me just say that I'm a big Marchetta fan eversince Saving Francesca. That book I totally dig because it's one of those few YA books that reeks with realism while still avoiding sex (it was only referred, which is still good to me). And then Marchetta sealed the fangirl in me in The Piper's Son. Loved it beyond words.It is not the case with Jellicoe Road. Actually, while writing this, I am still struggling on how to rate this one. But seeing how there are books that I admittedly say few of the best that didn't even receive a 5-star from me, then my rating just suggests personal preference.On with the bad: Taylor Markham. Ugh. I can't believe I'm even considering this, but I think I hate her just as much as I hate Katniss Everdeen. Taylor got into my nerve several more times than I can count. The fact that I'm reading the book through her perspective makes it that much worse. I have never ever encountered a lead character with so much negativity in her body (okay, maybe I did, but right now Taylor outshines them all in the worst way possible) that it was a struggle to finish her POV. And everytime I finish a chapter, I feel like treating myself to a Thai massage parlor. She's the kind of girl I take pains to avoid in real life, as she is very, very toxic. She has this false self-entitlement of the worst kind, believing that she is worthy of all the happiness in the world and stomping her foot on everyone's feet when it isn't delivered to her on a silver platter. She constantly blames the people around her for her misery, is ungrateful to the friends who stick to her Just Because (I mean, I can't see why, as she is just a prickly nose-in-the-air), and has no regard for anybody else's comfort other than her own. You know those kind of people who treat people around them like crap? That's exactly what Taylor is. C'mon Taylor, get over yourself! The fact that people around Taylor stuck to her only meant that the world in Jellicoe Road is that small that they couldn't escape bumping into her so why bother, might as well try to develop a (false/forced?) friendship with her. And even though I love Jonah Griggs, I fail to see how someone like him would take up so much interest in her. I mean, Jonah, you a masochist?! There are better girls out there! Case in point: Raffy the best girl friend ever. I think it is totally unreasonable for someone to be attracted to an obvious broken douchebag. Why would anyone want to fall in love with Taylor? Unless, of course, Jonah also this false self-righteousness thingy going on about him which makes him think that he is a kind of Superman or something - but this is a totally different story so will not dwell on this. Thankfully of course, because Marchetta is a street magician who is able to pull a rabbit out of a sack cloth, she was able to straighten Taylor's repulsive character. By the last 30 pages or so, I was able to see the total change in her character, but by then, I didn't care anymore about her. I just want to see how the story would tie up. Taylor's annoying personality singlehandedly took the star out of what could potentially be a five.The less .5 star (see, I always start out a Marchetta with a full five) is for that stupid territory wars. I mean, my country lost hundreds and thousands of lives, sacrificed families and loved-ones, just to secure our independence from greedy colonizers for years, and then I find this little orange book taking it up as 'just a game.' The fact that the characters even take up the territory wars too seriously - negotiating to leaders like it was a matter of life and death for them - offends me even more. How privileged these little kids must have been that they can afford to start a war all on their own accord. Tsk. Why don't you just toss Taylor in the middle of a bomb drill while you're at it, so I can maybe find a bit of solace in this abominable insensitivity? Okaaay, enough of the bad. Moving on.I am still glad to inform Marchetta readers that Jellicoe Road has her trademark knife-in-the-gut. Even now, whenever I think of what happened to the friends, I feel this pain in my chest that traps my tears and keeps them from coming out so I won't ever find my peace ever again in my life. Even Taylor's existence wasn't enough to mask the wonder of how Marchetta was able to tie the stories together in the end. Honestly, after 130+ pages of Taylor's negativity and nothing happening aside from that stupid (I will not tire of saying this) territory wars, I kind of wanted to fly to the bookstore and demand a refund. Boy, was I glad to have stuck with it. That's Marchetta's magic, I think. That she's able to draw in you a kind of faith which will make you jump off a cliff and still believe that you will land on the realm of rainbows and marshmallows. And while I may have personal issues on the whole 'dependency' thingy, I still find the narrative punch-in-your-pained-soul. I won't post spoilers, but if you're into deep life-wrecking-life-changing friendships, Jellicoe Road is the book to read.Will recommend it? Definitely.

It\u2019s my first experience with Marchetta, and I was hopeful to find another YA Australian author to add to my list of favorites. As a Printz winner and an often recommendation from several bloggers, I thought it stood a good chance of becoming a must read for me as well. Although I found this book hard to put down and I *liked* the story, I didn\u2019t find it a homerun, I\u2019m sorry to report.Taylor Markham has had a difficult life. As a child, she grew up in the home of a drug-addicted single mother who abandoned her at a gas station on Jellicoe Road. She was found by a woman named Hannah, with whom she has an often turbulent relationship, and ended up at the Jellicoe School. She finds it hard to relate to her fellow students and is taken by surprise when she is chosen to lead her classmates in a territory war with the Townies and Cadets that began so many years ago. Just as she is getting started in this new role, Hannah--the only family she\u2019s ever really known--mysteriously disappears, leaving her anxious and questioning her whole existence. With her support system vanished, Taylor finds friendship in unlikely places, all the while piecing together an old story about a terrible accident which also resulted in unlikely friendships, ones that Taylor begins to suspect may have affected her life in ways that she can\u2019t imagine.Marchetta is certainly a compelling writer, and I found myself very unable to put Jellicoe Road down. Let\u2019s just say in the two days it took me to read this book, my toddler was watching a lot of Sesame Street and eating a lot of treats. If that alone could make a book for me, than Marchetta would have aced the test.I enjoyed the complexity of the stories, and the ways in which they converged. I think what Marchetta did best was to illustrate the need everyone has of family, of belonging, of knowing that someone somewhere loves you. That connection to the past, to your own origins, is so tantamount because it gives you a place to be rooted, and then you are free to grow, to change, to become what you want to. When terrible things happen, there must be an explanation, no matter how tragic or how hurtful, as to why. There is a certain peace and calm that comes with knowledge and understanding, especially of a person\u2019s past. Without that, Taylor was just a wisp in the wind, unable to connect to anyone, to really care about life, to look past her own strange and concealed history.Marchetta\u2019s characters do come off the page; they are very much alive and distinct. However, that they are realistic is not a compliment I can pay. I really tired of Taylor by the end. She is the type of character I rather dislike, in that she acts as if she can take care of herself but is completely unable, in every instance, to do so. Every bit of new truth set off either a health attack, a deep depression, or erratic and misdirected anger. Are these all normal emotions for someone who is faced with her kind of life? Perhaps, but it still bordered on a hysteria that gets old fast.I found Jonah to be equally as unbelieveable, but in the opposite way. He was the ever-stalwart caretaker, which I found to be a stretch for any normal person, certainly in the case of a teenage boy. Were there mitigating circumstances? Yes. But I think even taking those into consideration, it was just a little much. No relationship can stand when one person is always giving, the other always receiving. And Taylor needed all of what Jonah could give, and more. That all being said, I still felt both characters had depth. Although there was more than one instance of eye-rolling as I was reading their interactions, I\u2019ve got to hand it to Marchetta. Notwithstanding, Taylor and Jonah and all the other inhabitants of Jellicoe were all memorable characters.Overall, an interesting and enjoyable story, but not one I feel devoted to. I don\u2019t know that I would recommend this one. I think if it were to be made into a miniseries, \u201csoap opera\u201d would be the term to describe it. I simply didn\u2019t feel the degree of reality and seriousness that I wish could have been there.www.makniks.blogspot.com", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1772481704", "review_id": "1772481704", "date": "Sep 30, 2016", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Krista", "user_url": "/user/show/52562506-krista", "text": " I need to reread this book because the author is talented AND so I know what is going on and not skip over details that turn out to be exteremely important later on. Here are my random thoughts in no particular order with minimal editing since I am on an iPad.-There was a lot going on, and some of it just seemed to be added for extra drama (the child porn and tunnel/fire storyline at the end of the book). -It seemed extreme that the cadets would stomp on a school kid's fingers, so for a while I was thinking that this was a dystopian book where there was an actual war going on. -The previous generation confused me until the very end and I could barely keep their identities and connections to the current generation straight. This sounds like a dumb problem, but I think that the names in this book added to my frustration. A character might be referred to as their last name for the majority of the book, and then be referred to by their first name every once in a while. This is fine in dialogue, but it just seemed weird that with Taylor would mentally observe Jonah as Griggs even after they become an item and she had been calling him Jonah. -speaking of Jonah, it is implied that he killed his dad then later confirmed. But what were the consequences? Was it self defense? Was he a cadet as a punishment? Was there ever an investigation?-The origins of the territory wars didn't seem to click with the modern day version. These five individuals created it because they are such great friends (but from what I noticed they barely spent any time with it), and then it somehow morphs into an intense 6 week long battle where much of the point is to not spend time with your friends on the other teams (even though they obviously do). More transitional history would have been helpful. I mean I guess I can see them having the time to do this, since apparently they had enough time to dig a secret tunnel too.-Taylor sees a photo of the previous gen characters, and from this she can identify everyone EXCEPT Jude? The guy she has seen the most recently? Also there is a lot of repression, which I admit I am probably not familiar with(who knows, I might have repressed a lot of my life and not know it). It seems weird that she could have told one of her housemates that she was left alone with a sex offender and then repress it so that the other girl is her secret keeper, even from herself. She also repressed her happy memories with Hannah and Jude which just seemed convenient. Also why is Jude breaking a window to Hannah's house to get the manuscript?-I know I am not the first person to not grasp that Fitz killed Webb until it is brought up at the very end about being able to forgive Fitz. I know I am not the only one to be confused because Google auto filled my search for me after I typed in \"who killed Webb\" to add in the book title. I admit I skimmed over the first clue because I have very little interest in target shooting, and even f I had paid more attention I would not have pieced that together with Fitz throwing himself into the river to realize that Fitz was reenact in the death. -I thought that she did a good job linking how the struggles of the first gen characters impacted the next generation. I thought that Taylor's processing of the relationship with her mother was pretty authentic and I enjoyed reading her insights on the different types of relationships that one can have. -Why would Hannah not refer to the fact that she was Taylor's aunt though? It just seemed weird that she had seemed to identify as an aunt before the abandonment, and then she pretty much was like a distant counselor once Taylor was a student. I know she wasn't supposed to be a \"mom\" per Tate's orders, but she seemed unnecessarily distant considering how much she was able to bond with Fitz's kid.-Maybe I have been overdosing on too much YA lately, but is was probably a bit too much \"poor communication\" drama mystery for me. I think that the author has an incredible way with words that made me like this book much more than if it had been done by someone else.

Which wouldn't be so bad... if I didn't finish it three days ago.I've come to view media from two - and only two - perspectives. Entertainment. Enlightenment. When I read Wealth of Nations, I don't expect to be entertained, I expect to be enlightened. That is fair, I think. When I watch Avengers, I expect to be entertained but not enlightened. That, too, is fair. Perhaps what is less fair is that when I read a novel, I expect to be both entertained and enlightened. Fair or not, that is how I judge the value of fiction. I expect to learn something new and I expect to be entertained as I do. My criteria for new knowledge are not stringent: I will take concrete knowledge about a culture, or a place, or a scientific theory, or a time in history, but I will also accept more nebulous knowledge, like a new idea, a new perspective, or even a new way of wording things.Once, for example, I went to a poetry reading of a Russian poet whose name I cannot recall who read poems about stuff I cannot recall. There were some fancy schmancy metaphors, I believe. There usually are. But I can't recall any of them. Except for one: the poet compared love to a chemical bond. He said, \"I cannot unlove you. You changed my chemical composition.\" What a fabulous way of looking at it! That's all I remember. But it was worth it.Jellicoe Road did not give me even that. I learned the plot of course, the characters, the basic vibe and feel and emotion of it. It was far from a boring read. Yet nothing managed to make its way from the pages and into ME. I grew in neither mind nor spirit.Now it is no fault of Jellicoe Road that I am well read, that I am knowledgeable, that I am no longer a teenager. But then neither can I be expected to review it from a perspective other than my own. I think that, for a non-trivial set of people, there is MUCH to learn here, for the writing is clean and good and far from bereft of memorable lines.Yet those two missing stars is not entirely subjective either. The characters behave oh so predictably until about 100 pages in. Taylor, our relatable-but-not-likable protaganist, angsts up a storm. The adults are woefully absent and predictably oblivious. And tough guy Jonah Griggs plays tough macho guy to a T. He's tough, yo. It's not until this scene in a jail, when Jonah actually shows some compassion, that the story starts, that the characters are actually allowed to become humans, instead of cardboard cut-outs. Now, I'm not the only one who's saying this. Read even those 5 star reviews in here and you'll see them mention how it has a slow start. Most attribute it to the \"confusing\" pseudo-split narrative (which I didn't find confusing at all - in fact the 'mystery' seemed blatantly obvious to me, but luckily I wasn't reading it as a mystery and so therefore did not mind), but I would argue it's a matter of bad characterization.In particular: Hannah, who has been Taylor's caretaker ever since Taylor was abandoned by her mother some six or seven years earlier. Much of Taylor's angst derives from Hannah's disappearance early on in the novel. Unfortunately, her disappearance occurs before Hannah's character is even established! So there's this immediate disconnect between the reader and Taylor, and her angst therefore takes awhile to settle in and feel organic.Which it does. The characters do gain depth and heft and humanity. The split narrative eventually melds together, even has a delightful parallelism to it. The story gains poignancy and emotion and life.Yet, perhaps because of these early flaws, what I said about a lack of enlightenment still holds true. I gained very little. This is a story, whose emotional beats I have already tread many a time. This is not a unique story, not a unique setting, not a unique voice.As such, for me, Jellicoe Road is three stars. Objectively, I would say it's four stars. And for some lucky individuals, it has everything a novel needs to be a full five stars.

When she was 11 Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother at a 7-11 gas station. A stranger named Hannah picks her up and takes her to the boarding school where Taylor spends the next six years feeling abandoned. There is one incidence when she is 14 when she tries to run away to find her mother, but the Cadet who is with her gets scared and calls his school. The Brigadier stops them before Taylor can see her mother. Everything changes when Taylor is in her last year of school and Hannah disappears without a note. Taylor feels abandoned all over again. In addition, the start of the territory wars between the Cadets, including the Cadet who ran away with her, townies, and the school. Taylor struggles with her depression and overwhelming sense of loneliness as she deals with her feelings towards that Cadet and discovers her family history. Throughout Taylor's narrative are stories by Hannah, which turn out to be her teenage history that is markedly linked to Taylor's. There are a lot of depressed people and secrets in the story, both of which bug me. The depressed people I get because all of them have suffered tragic events, but it isn't necessarily lighthearted to read about. One thing I wish Marchetta had done is include more descriptions of the characters. I have no idea what any person looks like, except for Taylor's mother and Santangelo. It was very confusing at first to get the characters straight, especially since the story starts with Hannah's story and then the next chapter abruptly jumps to Taylor's POV. I felt like I need to draw a character map to keep everyone straight. There could have been more character development and description to sort everyone out.(Spoilers in the next paragraph)My biggest problem with the story and what keeps me from absolutely loving this novel is the adults in the story. Where are they? And why do they feel the need to keep secrets? Hannah is Taylor's mother's childhood friend and her father's sister. She should have told Taylor about their family connection. There was no point in keeping it a secret. When Hannah took Taylor in she promised Taylor's mom that she would not act like Taylor's mom, but that didn't mean she couldn't be the aunt or tell Taylor stories about her mom. Instead, Hannah continues to make Taylor feel unloved and like she doesn't have a family. Also, Taylor's mom was a worthless drug addict whose wishes maybe weren't worth keeping. Taylor deserved a mom and Hannah could have filled that role because Taylor deserved to be loved even if it hurt Taylor's mom's feelings. I think Hannah probably still had mental problems (severe depression, etc.) leftover from her childhood, and that may be why she didn't always make the right decisions. The Brigadier also annoys me because he kept secrets about his past, and again, there was no point in leaving all the mysteries around him so that people thought he was a serial killer. Besides the fact that there were some unnecessary secrets kept by Hannah and the Brigadier, the story is good. It has a magical feel to it, like there's something about the setting and story that isn't quite real. I enjoyed Marchetta's writing style (except for some confusion at the beginning). I think some people will really like the story and others will kind of like it, but I don't think anyone will hate it. On the Jellicoe Road reminds me of a lot of the other recent YA Australian novels, and if you have enjoyed some of those (e.g. Jasper Jones, Graffiti Moon) then you should enjoy this one.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-2013"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/186754370", "review_id": "186754370", "date": "Jul 20, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Katie", "user_url": "/user/show/4646665-katie", "text": "I wanted so badly to fall deeply in love with this book. Before purchasing, I always do a fair deal of Goodreads research on my selections and the ratings for this book were off the chart. Nearly all the reviewers I follow had read it at one point or another, and all of them had given it a final five star rating. But I just didn't fall like the rest of you, unfortunately.As forewarned in several reviews, Jellicoe Road was very difficult to break into. Marchetta wastes zero time on explanation or world-building, preferring instead to simply toss you in and let you figure it all out on your own. It was an interesting experience (and not one I can say I've had before in the Young Adult genre) but the more I think about it, the more I think that there's a reason authors tend to avoid revealing so little. With such minor exposition, I read through the first one hundred and fifty pages (at least) without a clue as to what was going on and without emotional attachment to any of the characters, which I find sad in retrospect because they truly were an amazing set of individuals.The second issue I had was that, once I finally read far enough to appreciate the story and feel included, I unraveled the mystery far too quickly. By the time I reached the climax at the end, the swell of emotion didn't overwhelm me; I'd already figured it all out and that unfortunately made the packaging of the big reveal feel gratuitously melodramatic.Most of all, I severely struggled with believability from about halfway into the novel until the end. (view spoiler)[Why on earth would Hannah not tell Taylor who her parents were? Why didn't The Brigadier explain it to her when Hannah disappeared and Taylor was so clearly looking for answers? I found the \"true identity\" secrecy ridiculous and necessary only because it was convenient to the plot. And I was left with so many questions: What are the odds that Fitz just happened to aim exactly where Webb was sitting in that tree? And if he had a clear enough vantage point to hit a can, how on earth did he miss seeing a teenage body falling into the river immediately after? Why would five people who enjoyed spending time together start a \"war\" about boundaries\u2014Wouldn't they want to share their space equally because they liked each other? How did Taylor not know her own mother's first name? I could go on, but I think I've made my point. (hide spoiler)]But, looking past all of my negatives listed above, I did find Marchetta's writing style to be absolutely gorgeous, as promised. The pages were filled with lyrical, flowing prose that held all the right emotions. No complaint there at all. The Australian settings were gorgeous and unlike anything else I'd read in a book before. And by the end, I was undeniably attached to several of the characters (predictably, Jonah Griggs was my absolute favorite, closely followed by Ben (who was adorable)).I have read reviews that say this book truly turns golden when read for a second time and I can completely believe that being true.

M\u00e1s a\u00fan, cuando Hannah desaparece y encuentra un borrador sobre la historia de esos 5 chavales en la casa de Hannah. Comienza a sospechar que los rumores podr\u00edan ser verdad y a partir de ah\u00ed, los 3 grupos en que se divide el campamento y los cuales luchan entre s\u00ed aunar\u00e1n fuerzas para descubrir lo que de verdad ocurri\u00f3 en aquel camino.En este libro se juntan muchos sentimientos aunque muy bien descritos a lo largo del libro: miedo por un asesino en serie que anda suelto; melancol\u00eda por la desaparici\u00f3n inesperada de Hannah; dudas ante el comportamiento de John Griggs, jefe de uno de los grupos del campamento, quien a veces parece sentir algo por ella y otras la ignora; temor ante el brigadier, quien es su principal sospechoso de ser el asesino en serie y quien parece saber m\u00e1s de lo que aparenta.Muchas claves se ir\u00e1n resolviendo a lo largo del libro e incluso la protagonista compartir\u00e1 un viaje inesperado en busca de respuestas que solo se ver\u00e1n resueltas de boca de la persona menos esperada.En primer lugar, la historia me ha gustado porque vemos dos historias diferentes mezcladas entre s\u00ed con muchos puntos en com\u00fan y es la protagonista la encargada de ir uni\u00e9ndolos. Con la ayuda de los chicos del grupo Cadete ir\u00e1 avanzando en sus pesquisas pero solo los verdaderos protagonistas podr\u00e1n ayudarle a dar color a la imagen y desvelar toda la trama.He disfrutado de la historia individual de Taylor con su grupo de chicas, su sentimiento de independencia y a la vez de ese amor hacia Hannah que descubre una vez se ha ido \u00e9sta. Tambi\u00e9n la historia de amistad-amor entre Taylor-Jonah y Raffy-Chaz. Y, sobre todo, c\u00f3mo los grupos del campamento intentan invadirse unos a otros y tratan de hacer pactos, como si fueran \"peque\u00f1os guerreros\", y c\u00f3mo se descubre c\u00f3mo se origin\u00f3 todo aquello.Por otro lado, el libro, para mi gusto, tambi\u00e9n tiene cosas negativas. Una es que, al igual que cada persona es un mundo tampoco hay dos libros iguales y aunque la historia es estupenda, el final parece imitar en su narrativa al de The Lovely Bones y es algo que para m\u00ed le quita puntos pues no tienen nada que ver y el libro de Alice Sebold es bastante m\u00e1s tr\u00e1gico y emotivo. Otro punto negativo, de la historia es la cantidad de personajes que hay entre sus p\u00e1ginas y c\u00f3mo eso puede hacer que el lector pierda el hilo f\u00e1cilmente. En conclusi\u00f3n, un libro ameno y con el que es f\u00e1cil engancharse y pasar una tarde entretenida, pero sin grandes pretensiones.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["read-2012"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/113441427", "review_id": "113441427", "date": "Jul 25, 2010", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Sandra", "user_url": "/user/show/3943159-sandra", "text": "I liked this book, however I felt like I was not sucked into this book in same manner as The Luxe, The Hunger Games, or Tyrell. I think I find it easier to engaged into a book when I am familiar with the setting, the rules, or the situations. Jellicoe Road does not take place in the US, it takes place in Australia. Although the novel takes place in a school, with traditions, I just feel like an outsider looking in. I like books that have a lot of unanswered questions, however, I felt like I didn't quite know where the book was doing. I didn't fully understand the plot. And I know for a fact that I will have to re-read the book to fully understand all parts of the book. So becaues I couldn't really find my comfort zone within the pages of the book, I couldn't give it a higher rating than 3 stars. I found the novel to be wonderfully written. I can understand why the novel won the Printz Award. The characters are full of depth and layers. I adore the character of Taylor for her rough exterior, her protective covering, yet having the softest heart and love for her House. I felt like Taylor, who was abandoned by her mom, knew how to be a mom to the younger girls in her house. She might have been tough, she might have yelled, she might have wanted her space but she really loved each and every girl. This novel needed a context by which Taylor could find out her history. I though the turf wars were a perfect way to set up this scavenger hunt. However, I felt like many of the situations that the students placed themselves into were unrealistic. Or maybe just unrealistic for the United States. I don't know how many boarding schools do not have a closer eye on their charges as they ran though the woods, having secret meetings on a nighly basis. The ending was emotional. I was happy that Taylor finally finds her family, the family that has been protecting her all her life. And it was very sad to see her mother die. I was not prepared for her mother actually coming back. As a reader, I was more prepared to hear that her mother had already passed. However, I was happy that Taylor got some sort of closure at the end. Although this novel is beautifully written, I would have to think it would be a hard sell for young adults. The language is rather high. The plot is set in a country they don't fully understand. However, Taylor's character is universal and can translate to the liking of the right student. What I liked most about this novel is that it talked about the feelings of those kids who are orpahned by their parents. Taylor was oraphned by her mother by choice. Where as a lot of the charges at the school were wards of the state for more tragic reasons. I think there may be some students who may relate to this feeling of being neglected or orphaned. I also think another question that can be explored using this novel is the idea of whether a drug addicted mother should give up custody of their child for the child's well being? So there is a lot of value and questions to be raised in this novel.

I don't really know what to think. Apparently everyone else is raving about it. I feel like maybe there's something I'm not quite getting about it.I mostly enjoyed it, and it was well written. But I also had problems with it. Like the whole 'war' set up seemed bizarre and inexplicable for much of the book. Maybe there were formatting issues with the ebook, but the switches between the present day narrative and what was eventually revealed to be Hannah's story were really abrupt and unsignalled. Not even a blank line between them. So I'd be reading about Taylor's day, and then I'd be half way through the next paragraph before I realised the narrative had switched to the other story line. The confusion never lasted long, but it was jarring and annoying.Speaking of confusion - I never got it straight in my head who all the kids in Hannah's story were. Every single one of them had a stupid non-gender-specific name. I knew who the characters were, but couldn't match the names to them, so never knew who was doing what. Even by the end of the book I couldn't tell you which one was Jude and which one was Webb :-/I didn't really like/buy/understand the supernaturally bits.And I never really understood the school set up. The kids seemed to have a ridiculous amount of freedom and responsibility. I get that part of the point must be that adults don't really feature cuz they're so irrelevant to the important bits of the kids lives, but it basically seemed like a load of teenagers lived in a house with no adult, and an arbitrarily chosen 17 year old (I only know she's 17 cuz all the other reviews say so. Maybe it said so on the back of the book - but I shouldn't have to rely on that for information. I don't recall it ever saying so in the actual story) is responsible for dozens of kids between the ages of 11 and 16. That seems... an unlikely set up.Then, having all been fun and hijinks (I guess*), it suddenly switches tone in the final quarter or so with some really unsavory revelations about Taylor's past.And finally, that zinger about 'the serial killer' was just a bit too much. It over-egged the pudding.Hmm, all I've done is complain about stuff, but honestly, I quite enjoyed the book despite all these grumbles! (I wouldn't have finished it otherwise). I'm sure everyone else has said what's good about it, so I'll leave my review here. * Personally I found it horrific that the musician had his fingers damaged (I assumed at first they were broken, but he seemed alright a bit later), but none of the characters seemed to think it was anything remotely important! I had a problem with Taylor falling for the guy who inflicted that damage.******** EDIT *********oh, actually having read some of the other reviews: No. No swooning. Not even a bit.

I was so sure I would. I remember epicreads posting quotes and pictures on Instagram and I immediately bought the book. So what happened? The book began in a very confusing way. There was no introduction to the character. It went from a italicized prologue to a 22 years later heading and then straight into the narration of Taylor Markham. Her voice was not different from the italicized sections, so at first I thought my Kindle bugged out and I wasn\u2019t reading the beginning because I was so confused. Who is narrating? Is this not the same person? Where are we? What is happening? What war? WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?! Why am I supposed to care? What is important? WTF?! I felt like that for about 30% of the book, which is quite a large section to be confused and irritated. I knew from other reviews that the book would pick up soon and make sense, but I promised myself I would not rate it 5 stars even if I loved it because I wouldn\u2019t forget how irritated the beginning was. Yes, now that I\u2019m done it makes sense. Yes, it was a good story. Yes, I even cried. But the execution of Jellicoe Road was horrible and it\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t forgive the author for the beginning. It should have done what beginnings of stories are supposed to do and explain, build, and draw me in. Not confuse the hell out of everyone. It\u2019s not brilliant that it all \u201ccomes to together in the end\u201d and makes sense. It\u2019s crap. I loved the actual plot. I eventually enjoyed Taylor\u2019s narration, even if I never quite connected with her. I still don\u2019t feel like I knew her at all, but at least the pieces of her life were put together. I loved the end result of Jellicoe Road. It could have been an unforgettable and amazing story. I cannot say whether anyone was believable because I felt so disconnected from everyone. I was so confused for so long. I was angry at Taylor for being dull and not giving me more information. I liked figuring out who was who and finding out so many memories and layers were all interconnected, but I wish the execution of the story was different and smoother.  I wish I could give Jellicoe Road more credit for being amazing, but I just couldn\u2019t get over the way it was told. I am frustrated that it wasn\u2019t better and more organized because I would have absolutely loved it. I am used to strange writing styles, being thrown into a story, and being told two different stories. I\u2019m used to YA. I\u2019m used to this kind of fiction. Unfortunately, this just didn\u2019t work for me. I am giving it 3 stars because it was a good story, so I don't want to underrate it.Review Originally published at Love, Literature, Art, and Reason book Review Blog", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/209241882", "review_id": "209241882", "date": "Sep 16, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Cassy", "user_url": "/user/show/1867541-cassy", "text": "This book... I liked this book but this was a hard book to like. Marchetta starts it out in a very confusing way that really turns the reader off to the book and it takes a little while to get into it.The book is WILDLY depressing. I mean, even the happier parts of it really aren't all that happy. Happy part: Jessa doesn't die. Happy part: Taylor finds out about her family and who they are. Happy Part: Taylor finds love. And, I guess that the teritory wars are kind of over by the time the book is over. They've all become friends.But the inbetween is so tragic. It's all steeped in loss; the Loss of Hannah's parents and then her brothers and, even at the end of the day, Tayor's mother. It's this group of kids who can never seem to catch a break. And then, just when Taylor figures it all out, figures her family all out, figures out that her House on Jellicoe Road has really been her family and home all along... it burns down. And she almost loses part of the family that she has.Also, Taylor starts out as this strong character and she gets... weepy a lot. I don't know. I get that the idea is that Marchetta wants her to learn to depend on the people around her, and I like that she learned to depend on the people in her house, like Raffy (I LOVED Raffy) but Griggs... I don't know. Her romance with Griggs just always kind of bothered me. They were so co-dependant and not in a healthy kind of way.I liked the character development of the Five. We got all this backstory about them even though a lot of them were dead. I loved hearing their story and hearing how they shaped Jellicoe road. They made a lot of the history of that place happen. I liked finally knowing what did happen to everyone and that you were kind of let to know along the way without being told. I DIDN'T like that you never really learned what happened to Webb. Yes, you learned that his brother Fitz shot him, but you never really figured that out until Taylor told you. And how did everyone else figure that out? I figured he'd been missing all these years but they all knew. I mean, for a story so centrally located around one boy, and what happened to him, I think we should have gotten a little more closure about his story.But I like that Hannah found family and I like that Taylor did too. I like that Jellicoe Road is this place of sadness and safety at the same time. I really liked Marchetta's writing. I'd be interested to read other things that she wrote.

This novel is utterly confusing until you get deep into the plot. Once you really realize that there are two stories being told, Taylor's story of her the time when she meets Jonah and forms a deep relationship, and the second is the story of Webb, Tate, Narnie, Fitz and Jude whose lives are interwoven following a tragic accident on Jellicoe Road. What makes the story difficult to follow is the fact that it isn't written in a chronilogical format. The reader, if in a classroom setting, might benefit from keeping notes on the characters or a timeline of events in each character's life. I didn't realize until late in the story that Taylor would meet her mother again, which is the perfect ending to the most confusing story I've read. Making a family tree visual prior to reading in the classroom, would offer meaning for the reader of the families and the conflict that exists. Marchetta deals with so many themes, it will be a long study for the class who takes on this book. The students or the reader will be forced to think about family relationships and roles. The reader will see many examples of friendships, both good and bad, which will lead to issues of loyalty. I also wanted to know more about the parents of these children. What parenting roles are to be modeled or emulated and what parental roles would we like to broach and forget? Children are often forced, too soon, to deal with the harshness life can offer with death's grief and with the possibility of abandonment by parents for whatever reasons. This would be an incredible book to use in order to study relationships. I would have to recommend that the teacher read it several times so as not to miss the many messages twisted into the plot and to be able to guide the reader through the issues creatively. Not an easy read is Jellicoe Road, but a most challenging and interesting one. Still, it is not one I would just pick up for pleasure, I would have to have encouragement or pressure if I were a student today. These are relevant topics in the game of life that all adolescents should embrace. This book may be very difficult for the suffering kid. It wouldn't be possible for the struggling reader.5Q 3P S", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["printz-award-books"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/209872127", "review_id": "209872127", "date": "Sep 17, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Jason", "user_url": "/user/show/4545082-jason", "text": "I've just become that guy.

I look down the Goodreads page and cannot find a single review that was not five stars. I feel evil. Why didn't I like the book? Well, let's just be clear on one thing: Melina Marchetta didn't do anything wrong. The book had narrative structure, character motivation, lyricism, and that ever important note of finality. But I just didn't believe it. I didn't feel emotionally involved in the story. I didn't find a connection with any of the characters, but to be fair Marchetta didn't give me any trails to hold onto. I felt like I was catapulted into the middle of the book; there was no build-up, no clarification, and no way to see insight into the protagonist's mind. I personally think this book would have benefited strongly from a first person narrative. I found Taylor's character to be interesting, but I just didn't feel connected to her. I felt like I was looking at the car crash, not like I was a part of it. But the ending was alright. Marchetta's strongest trait is her use of lyricism, and it's prominent towards the end. So, yeah. I did not like your favorite book and I feel like a terrible bastard for it (I wanted to like it). Just picture, if you will, that you never liked Harry Potter despite the popularity.

It is unique and does have a certain charm to it. But it seemed a little weird and random at times. As a result, the characters never did reach into my heart.

Taylor's story is the border pieces, Narnie's is the guess-where-to-even-start middle, and the manufacturer declined to put a picture on the box, so you just have to start putting together like colors and hope you can begin to see what they might comprise.

The mystery wasn't keeping me engaged enough, and because I was working on the pieces, they weren't inspiring an emotional connection. How can you care about something if you can't even make out what it is?Then roughly halfway through, Marchetta is like, \"Maybe this will help,\" and gives some better direction on what's supposed to go where, and I figured out what the puzzle was supposed to look like, except at that point I really didn't care. Let me say for the millionth time I had a shitty childhood pushed along by a crazy mother, and Taylor did not give me the feels about it (view spoiler)[and I'm annoyed by how nobly her mother is presented in the in end, because...bullshit.

Perhaps there were just to many, from the past and from the present.I was a little overstrained at first, i mixed up the characters and now, after having finished, i still don't comprehend exactly what the point of the hermit was.

That, i have to admit, is the beautiful side of this book.It's not the kind of writing that draws you in and doesn't let you put the book down, at least it wasn't for me, but it's raw and emotional in a way.It inspired me and it gives this book something special that i can't seem to fathom into words, but that's why i believe three stars would not be enough.I have hoped to enjoy this book more than i actually did, but still, it was a beautiful read in a way.3.5 stars :)Edit: I ended up changing it to three stars, because compared to other books this one just wasn't as good.

It came up under suggested reads quite a few times and on more than a few must read lists. In addition, it's received many glowing reviews by people I follow right here on Goodreads. So imagine my disappointment when I was underwhelmed while reading On the Jellicoe Road. Wait, let me back up. Before I felt underwhelmed, I felt confused. Yes, I'd say I was mainly confused. See, in addition to reading the book itself, I also read ABOUT the book, so I know confusion was a common complaint. But no worries. This will remedy itself around 100 pages in. Yes, you read that right. 100. PAGES. IN. (Mind you, this book is only 290 pages).Color me dumb, but I read way past the 100 page mark and still felt that I wasn't smart enough for this book. Yes, things came together a bit at the end, but for at least half of the story, I found myself scratching my head in confusion. For example, I personally didn't see the need for the war between the Townies and Cadets where the characters and their complexities seemed to be story enough. I also didn't understand the tone of this war. In the beginning it sounded like serious, apocalyptic, impending doom. But before long the groups started hanging out together. Were they enemies? Was it all in fun? I still really have no idea.I think the war was just a way to place the main characters of Taylor and Jonah at odds. They have a history with each other, but it didn't end well. Now they are leading opposing teams in the seasonal fight. Oooh, how apropos. And Taylor's mentor Hannah's disappearance? A way for Taylor to rediscover her roots I suppose.So if I didn't really enjoy On the Jellicoe Road, then why the 3 star rating you might ask? Well that's because I have to give credit where credit is due.

For me, the first part of the book was chopped up too much, jumping between past and present, fact and fiction, leaving so many unexplained statements that it was a little frustrating. Once I understood enough of the story, it finally flowed.The story is doled out in bits and pieces to maintain suspense for the reader, but it doesn't really make sense. The main character knows a lot about the central events, but the information that she knows is provided piecemeal to the reader. Once I had enough of the information, I had to wonder why the main character had been so clueless. The main character has also forgotten a lot of information that she remembers at convenient points throughout the story. For example, she told a story about her childhood to a friend, but she has forgotten the story. It was often implausible that she would have forgotten important events or failed to make connections. It came across as a plot device.However, I really liked the interactions between the teenage leaders of different factions and their war. I liked the uniqueness of their world. The main device used to reveal the story was an interesting choice, even if I would have liked it to be a little more clear what was going on right from the beginning. I'm not sure if the things that I liked about this book (that were 4 stars) were enough to outweigh the things that felt inauthentic, like the adult characters' inconsistent personalities and actions or the main character's inability to remember things or make connections just five or seven years later.

What is going on here? What kind of a school is this? Who is in charge here? Why don't the kids seem to have any authority figures? For the longest time, no answers were given to any of these questions. What was offered instead was a dual perspective between the main character, Taylor, and the third person narrative of a group of kids called Narnie, Fitz, Jude, Tate and Web. We had no idea who these kids were or where they fit in.I made notes along the way as I was reading when things started to become clear to me, and even when I stopped thinking about putting this down and started to enjoy it. This would not have been a book I would have read all the way through had it not been for all the reviewers before me who had the same problem and promised that it got better after it go past halfway. For all that, once I started to enjoy the book, I really started to enjoy the book. Taylor's reading of the previous group of kids who had gone through a very similar situation to herself, Griggs, Santangelo and Raffy grew on me. Once the book became less The Hunger Games before The Hunger Games was written and more a kind of mystery pushing towards the end where we actually get the answers we've been craving, as well as gifting me with the gratification of characters who actually interact and actually contribute something to each others' lives, I found myself enjoying it a lot more.Melina Marchetta is obviously a very talented writer.

I've read books that have gone back and forth between past and present and have been able to follow them, but the way this book was written was difficult to figure out in the beginning. The author knew all the characters and how they connected, but there's a lot of confusion until the reader (or maybe just me) is finally able to start piecing together where they each belong in the story. The other thing that made it a 2 was the \"territory wars\" between the teenagers in the book (all adults were oblivious). Was it really a war? Are there going to be casualties or are they just going to keep arguing with each other? Why does it matter who controls the club house or the prayer tree? At one point it seemed like little more than school rivalries, but ended with somewhat interesting insight on how the \"war\" began in the first place. I might not have been able to connect with that part of the story because it's been quite awhile since high school. The book is definitely geared towards teenagers (although, I won't be recommending it to any).The italicized glimpses into the past were always rated about a 4. The tragedy that brought together five friends and the mystery of what happened to each of them was what gave this book it's character and made it worth it to keep reading.As the story lines merged around page 250 or so, my rating went from about 2 stars to 4 stars, dropped briefly to a 1, and then rebounded to a 3. The heart of the story dealt with devastating tragedy and deep friendship that lasted even after death and the profound impact it had on the next generation. The ending truly came full-circle.

What unraveled it for me was my firsthand knowledge of asthma, post traumatic stress disorder, and the re-emergence of suppressed memories. When the heroine in the story, Hannah Markham, who suffered from all of those aforementioned qualities, would slip into an asthma attack, it was poorly described. She biked and ran seemingly great distances without any effects to her lungs. People talked her down from an asthma attack. I don't buy it. I feel like more time should have been spent developing how an asthma attack feels and should be taken care of if you're going to use it in a book, or not use it at all. For someone that has asthma it feels insulting, it just doesn't seem like it's a big deal, when it actually could kill you if not dealt with properly. The disregard in such a popular book is like \"Oh, it's just asthma, you'll be fine.\" As far as the PTSD goes, the effects are glossed over, the recovery is quick. Again, not buying it. Some of the triggers for the suppressed memories feel more accurate however. The recovery rate is different with everyone that suffers through something traumatic. But Hannah Markham has an extraordinarily high amount of traumatic events throughout her life that have been suppressed. Does this make her tougher or more vulnerable to the most traumatic one? But again, it seems that in telling the story, the author had a chance to shed light on the effects of PTSD and did a shoddy job of it. All of this being said, the characters are well developed, the story itself is interesting and well enough told. There are some twists in it that are unexpected. I simply knew too much from a medical perspective about things that I care about on a personal level that have affected a loved one of roughly the same age as Hannah.

I was also having a hard time determining the time periods since there is two narratives taking place but no clear dates associated with either. Once I got all of that sorted out, I really did enjoy the storyline and I felt like Marchetta's writing is really beautiful.

She is taken to a boarding school and begins a close relationship with Hannah, a mysterious young woman who lives on the property. Taylor is also haunted by her past, a suicide that she witnessed when she was younger and a runaway attempt where she met a boy named Jonah, but who later betrayed her. Flash forward to present day Taylor who is engaged in a territory war with two other groups of kids (one led by Jonah), her feelings towards Jonah and the mystery surrounding Hannah's disappearance and finding her mother.The story also includes a flashback of the aftermath of a horrible car accident twenty years prior.

It's convenient for Taylor, whose caretaker, Hannah, lives right outside school property. At the beginning of her senior year, she finds herself elected not only leader of her dorm, but leader of all the Jellicoe dorms in the Territory Wars in which her school, the Townies and the Cadets (who camp in the local bushland every year) participate. The rules have been passed down year after year in a purple notebook, and Taylor is under pressure to make sure things go smoothly for Jellicoe. However, just as things are getting underway, Hannah leaves without notice, and Taylor's life is in turmoil. She discovers that the manuscript of Hannah's that she's been reading over the years might be more than just a story, and she discovers that the Cadet she claims to have no history with might be more than just a one-time acquaintance. As the leaders of the various groups get closer through the War, they find that there is more to their game than they ever thought, and Taylor discovers that her family history is more complicated and bittersweet than she'd ever imagined.Marchetta's book is beautiful, but stricken with slow pacing that may not catch the attention of many readers. While the snippets of Hannah's manuscript and the peeks at romance certainly make things interesting, the plot doesn't pick up until at least half way through the book, and the Territory Wars are confusing at best until the very end.

At the beginning I found it very confusing. A story told in italics, a bitchy, hateful teenager, and a weird Skulls-esque secret society who are fighting a turf war with no purpose. It took a while for the plot to sort itself out and to get me to care about all the characters, though I did by the end. I also thought there was too much foreshadowing, so by the time Taylor makes her revelations, it's not shocking, it's something that I've figured out chapters before. At the beginning it seemed like that was the point: that Taylor really know the truth but doesn't want to say it aloud, and won't admit she knows until it's completely obvious. I'm not sure if that's what the author intended though.I didn't like the climax. It seemed over the top like the author wanted a big gesture to get her point across, but it made me skeptical (like of course that would happen) especially when the real cause came out. Disappointing, but once all that was over I loved the actual ending. So by the end it all came together and made sense.

She throws you in the deep end to start with, and the book feels very mysterious as you are presented with two stories that seem unrelated, and you spend the first 100 or so pages trying to figure out who everyone is and what is going on. I actually really enjoyed how the two stories ended up interweaving, and how the mystery is slowly revealed.On the other hand, I found it really really really frustrating at how the adults in the story refused to tell the main character anything. So much would have been solved with just a little bit of frankness. Sure, I get that you don't tell children every horrible thing that happens, but there were some basic facts of the story that there was no reason to keep secret, even from a ten year old, let alone from a seventeen year old. It felt like secrets for the sake of the mystery, and the adults came off looking incredibly stupid and negligent because of it.Because of this, I have to knock it down to three stars, even though while reading it, I would probably have given it four. Be warned though, this is not the book to pick if you are looking to feel good. It is sad, and horrific, and only at the very end is it hopeful.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/161096101", "review_id": "161096101", "date": "Apr 14, 2011", "rating": 3, "user_name": "Jacki", "user_url": "/user/show/966941-jacki", "text": "Summary: Taylor tries to piece together the mystery of why her mother abandoned her at a 7-11 years ago, what happened to Hannah, the woman who lives adjacent to her boarding school and is the closest thing to a parent she has, who a mysterious hermit really was, if there's a serial killer threatening her friends, and what, if anything, this all has to do with Hannah's manuscript about five kids who used to live on the Jellicoe Road where Taylor's school is, where her mother left her. On top of that, she has to deal with leading her boarding school houses in a territory war against the neighboring Townies and the military school Cadets, even though she has a crush on both leaders of the rival factions.Verdict: Confusing, drags in parts, but fun nonetheless.Positive: The mystery was well-crafted and took me a while to figure out.

The romance was also decent once it got off the ground.Negative: It took me over 150 pages to figure out what was going on. Territory wars? Cadets?

In the five or so years since, I realized I forgot so much about this story that I had to revisit it and, well, here we are.

I also forgot about the teen angst. I'm pretty sure I was a teenager myself when I read this book so maybe I understood Taylor better, but this time around, I was kind of over it. Don't get me wrong, I love me an angry, unlikable and bitter protagonist, but Taylor walks the thin line between unlikable and I'm-better-than-everyone-else. There are instances where the writing patronizes \"other girls\" - those who flirt and only care about boys and obviously can't be witty or smart. NO. We're not doing this anymore. Not in 2020, satan. There's also another aspect of this story that I never paid much attention to but I can't help focusing on it now: It's the casual physical violence? (view spoiler)[ Taylor slaps Jonah, Jonah beats up Ben, Jonah grabs Taylor by her neck and shoves her against the wall? (hide spoiler)] Why was that necessary?

Because Jellicoe Road is many things, many of which I didn't enjoy, yes, but most importantly, it was  tranquil, and for me, that was the novel's winning streak. Slow-paced and off to a sort of vapid start, I had trouble immersing myself into the story at first. There are present day chapters, and then we suddenly switch to another timeline where completely different characters are doing completely unrelated things, and to be honest, I think that could have been handled a little better, especially the introduction of all the characters to the reader. But what I did not expect was how beautifully Marchetta was able to weave both the past and the present together without me really noticing until it was right in front of my eyes. While I can't really say that I was attached to any of the characters in particular, I did care about them to some degree, enough for what happened to them to matter to me. And while the climax is heartbreaking and sorrowful, I still felt this weird sort of detachment, which I think I'll chalk up to Marchetta's writing style. Taylor was a great narrator, and so were Narnie and Jude. I do think this had more potential, or maybe just not the right kind of read for me at the moment. Either way, I would definitely recommend it to someone who's looking for something tranquil, calm, and nostalgic.

Harper Teen ~Language R, Sexual Content~R Violence~PG-13Jellicoe Road in Austrailia is the main character in this novel about finding who you are and the importance of family relationships. Taylor Markham, age seventeen, is the leader of a house of girls at a boarding school in Austrailia. Each Summer, the boarding school kids participate in territory wars with the Cadets (Summer camp attendees from the military academy in Sydney) and the Townies (kids from the local town.) The novel begins with a flash-back that grabs the reader\u2019s attention immediately, however, when chapter 1 begins it is slightly disorienting and it takes a few pages for the reader to orient themselves in the world of Taylor. There is a mystery embedded in the narrative that may initially cause confusion among readers, but those who stick with the storyline will be highly rewarded. I personally had a hard time wanting to stay with the story but I loved how it all came together. This title won the Michael L. Printz award for 2009.

Abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road when she was eleven, Taylor Markham, now seventeen, is finally being confronted with her past. But as the reluctant leader of her boarding school dorm, there isn't a lot of time for introspection. And while Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family, has disappeared, Jonah Griggs is back in town, moody stares and all. In this absorbing story by Melina Marchetta, nothing is as it seems and every clue leads to more questions as Taylor tries to work out the connection between her mother dumping her, Hannah finding her then and her sudden departure now, a mysterious stranger who once whispered something in her ear, a boy in her dreams, five kids who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen years ago, and the maddening and magnetic Jonah Griggs, who knows her better than she thinks he does. If Taylor can put together the pieces of her past, she might just be able to change her future. Some students might enjoy the book as it deals with initiations and cliques.

The shift in the two points of view could at first be really difficult to follow especially when you're still trying to get to know the characters. However, once you get accustomed to it, boy, will you appreciate the power of Melina Marchetta's writing ability. I'm glad I didn't put down this story (when I was getting frustrated by the first half, hehe) because the second half was such an experience. I have to admit, though, that I found the supporting characters more interesting than Taylor. I just didn't really care for her and the only reason why I finished the book was that I was really interested in Hannah's story. Also, I hoped that there would be more to the territory wars plot. It kind of disappeared in the second half of the book which is a bit disappointing after so much build-up in the first half. Jonah Griggs' story is also a fascinating one and I found myself wishing that his past would be explored more. His speech regarding his guilt over his father's death was my favorite in this story. I considered giving this two and a half stars because while I didn't hate it, I wouldn't say that I liked it that much that I'd use it to introduce Marchetta's works to my friends (I'd suggest the Lumatere Chronicles, by the way).

This is a really cool idea, and it brings some playful fun to the novel.

Thus follows a series of revelations of unbelievable connections between Taylor & the group, which she takes forever to realise, but that's pretty obvious to the reader much sooner.
