It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it\u2019s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School \u2013 Taylor\u2019s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about \u2013 mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn\u2019t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor\u2019s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she\u2019s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn\u2019t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic?

By the time the book started making sense, I have lost any interest in the story and in the characters!\ud83c\udf1f I also didn\u2019t enjoy the setting of the book, the whole territory war thing was not for me and the jumping between past and present and the narrative style was not for me :(!\ud83c\udf1f I believe it had an OK writing or I would have DNF it and not continue it.\ud83c\udf1f Summary: It was more of an \u201cIt\u2019s me not you\u201d problem, I expected to love the book although the synopsis wasn\u2019t interesting for me.

feel right now:\n\nMe. Just me....alone with a majority of people of who LOVED, ADORED, OBSESSED over this particular novel. And oh, dear God please don't hate me (especially you, my dear, sweet Anna) but.....I couldn't love this book. I tried. I tried so, so, SOOOOOO hard, but, in the end, I never once did I feel myself drawn back to this story. When I put the book down, it was just that-I put it down. It didn't exist beyond when it was in my hands. And I know that's not how it's supposed to feel. \"What do you want from me?\" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.Gawd, you guys I wanted to love this so hard. As I was tossing and turning on this horrible last Sunday night (the depression of not loving this book was a visceral feeling), I came to a crushing realization: I'd rather be fighting my Sunday night demons (I can NEVER sleep on Sunday nights, but that's neither here nor there...) attempting to sleep even when I knew I couldn't than reading more of this book. And that kept me from sleeping, as well. I repeatedly asked myself, 'What's wrong with me?' 'Why am I the only person who didn't like this?'. And, admittedly, I still hate that I couldn't find much to identify with.Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.I think Marchetta's ideas are so profound, but I just hate how she delivers them. She's lost me in both books I've attempted to read and I think I just need to realize that this author is not for me. It doesn't mean she's not an excellent writer-she is. But, and this is going to sound so harsh, if the only tears I cried were from boredom? There's a problem. Just because a book is beautiful and has poetic writing doesn't mean it can't be boring and....for me....it was boring until like 60%. Even in the end when it was supposed to all tie together, I finally just didn't care. I don't think I would have anyway, honestly. I'm such a bad reader-I really only cared about Jonah and Taylor, and I feel like they hardly had any real, tangible time together.\"What's with what you're wearing?\" Griggs asks while we stand outside waiting for the others.\"It's pretty hideous, isn't it?\" I say.\"Don't force me to look at it,\" he says. \"It's see-through.\"That kills the conversation for a couple of seconds.And, I swear this is the last negative section, that's my biggest problem. Why does there have to be so many people on each page? It's confusing, it made it drag, and I didn't get NEAR enough Jonah...at all. And the territory wars-I'm sorry, but how could this be a main plot point??? It was fun at first, and then I was like...please, please, PLEASE stop-they didn't make sense. Or, I just was too far gone to care...again.Though very little worked for me, there were some shining moments. Jonah. Oh my goodness did I love him. He and Taylor together. All of their moments separate from the school were amazing and fun to follow, but it just took so damn long to get there. I loved the way he looked at her and how he was always so protective of her. How he would do anything to make sure she stayed safe. And, most importantly, how they changed each other's lives forever.\"You care about nothing, you piece of shit!\"I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.\"Never,\" he tells me in a tone full of ice, \"underestimate who or what I care for.\"Okay, so, I've said my piece and it's clear I'm in the minority-it's clear that everyone thinks all the things I hated are what make an excellent story, so don't take my word for it. Just know, this book is beautiful in it's own right....it's just not the book for me.Anyway...now everyone can fight over my carcass...sorry.\n\nFor more of my reviews, please visit:\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n************************************Because Anna told me to.

Sometimes I save books that I feel like I will love for when I really need them. I thought this book was going to be one of those books that I would love because it is so loved on Goodreads and it sounds so interesting. Instead of loving it, I really disliked it overall and that is because the first 50% is atrocious. I almost marked it as a DNF at 55% because of how bored I was but I powered on and I was able to finish it. I think I've narrowed down the main problems with the first half. First of all, Marchetta makes the whole land war thing really vague and I was so confused as to what it actually was. I mean how hard is it to say its like a game? I was like \"is this a dystopian novel, what the hell is going on?\" at the start. Marchetta also makes the whole thing really confusing with the two different stories and the time jumps and the dreams vs reality aspect. Instead of being mysterious and cool, I thought it was muddled and boring. Also, I guessed how the whole thing connected correctly and so the whole thing was just a waiting game for me and not like this crazy good revelation. Secondly, Taylor was the other main problem in part one. She was like completely self-absorbed and it felt like she didn't really care about the other characters and she was like really separated from everything that happened around her. This created a disconnect between me and her and me and the other characters (because it was all told from her point of view). And its not even like characters like Taylor are the problem, it was just a problem in this particular book. Basically I thought the first 50% was like a really bad mystery novel because the author clearly tried to be mysterious, she kept dangling things in front of the readers without divulging anything meaningful, I guessed what was going to happen because it was so obvious and Taylor wasn't being completely forthcoming with the readers or herself. The second half was literally like reading a completely different book - Taylor completely changed, the whole tone of the book changed, it was clear and concise, I could connect to the characters and I even felt emotional at bits. If the whole book had had those qualities, this could have been a great book but then I guess there would be a lot less pages. I liked bits of the writing. I thought it was quite easy to read and I could see myself liking one of her other books if the story was different. The romance was annoying. So. Much. Angst! I did not ship it. I mean, what solidified me not shipping it was when Jonah pinned her against a wall, lifting her off the ground in a fit of rage. Relationship goals? I think not. Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I'm in the minority though so if you're reading this review and you haven't read the book, you could read it and love it like the rest of my Goodreads friends. I probably would be open to reading more by Melina Marchetta in the future.------------------------------------\"\"I'm the same age my father was when he died,\" she told me. \"I'm older than he will ever be.

It's... interesting, if you find it interesting to read about teenagers! Having drama! About fucked-up parents! And secrets! About their past! And there's this one boy! In a tree!Yeah, the boy in a tree is a dream about the main character's father and it's all very symbolic and whatever.So, basically it's a contemporary YA novel about a girl named Taylor who was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven and has grown up at a boarding school. She's now a senior (or a \"Year Twelve\" or whatever they call them in Australia) and has just been put in charge of her house by a shadowy cabal of fellow students, which starts the book off with a lot of adolescent politics and power games leading to the annual \"war\" between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets in which Taylor is supposed to be leader and supreme commander of her Jellicoe kiddies. Mostly she spends the time whining, having asthma attacks, emoting about her tormented past and a mother who evidently suffered from all sorts of drug and mental health issues, and trying to uncover what happened to her father and some other people her parents knew. There's one teacher at the Jellicoe school named Hannah whom Taylor kind of sort of looks up to as a role model, and Hannah suddenly disappears, which ramps up Taylor's abandonment issues to eleventy, and since she's already a teenager and therefore living in a universe from which the gravity of her own self-importance allows no light to escape, she pretty much treats all her friends and the younger children at her school like shit, even though for some inexplicable reason they all look up to her.I didn't like Taylor much. Yeah, she's had some rough breaks. But at the point where she's screaming at eleven-year-olds who have had their own rough breaks, not that this would ever occur to her, I lose most of my sympathy for her.The whole \"territory war\" premise, in which the students, the Townies, and the Cadets wage a mock war complete with rules and treaties and things, all passing under the radar of all the responsible adults, was just a pretext to keep throwing Taylor together with Jonah, the leader of the Cadets, the brooding, dangerous, but secretively sensitive boy with his own tormented past who just needs the healing power of poontang as much as Taylor needs the healing power of peen. At the point where he and Taylor have the inevitable sex, the writing is just short of turgid with lots of \"inside\" and \"oneness\" metaphors and as graphic as a \"literary\" Young Adult novel will allow, so it's mostly about Feelings! And breath! And also kind of painful (for Taylor). Like giving teen readers a little taste of the forbidden apple and trying to make it sound kind of cool and exciting but also a little bit scary and vague, which I suppose is exactly how most teenagers view sex before they've tried it.I can see why teenagers, particular younger ones, would go breathless for this book, but I'm too jaded and also, I have to say, this is a very girly book. By which I mean, Taylor's breathless first-person POV running at a constant high pitch of intense emotionalism is obviously meant to resonate with Taylor's peer group, and all of her actions and concerns and preoccupations, she goes about dealing with in a very teen girl way, which is fine but so outside my mindset that I couldn't relate. This is not a book for me.The writing was pretty good for a YA novel, and the story eventually becomes one of adults hiding secrets (surprise!) which are finally dragged into the light and Taylor and Griggs getting some closure on their hurtful pasts, and everyone essentially having a group hug at the end, though not without a bittersweet denouement. It is possible that, boy or not, I would have really liked this book when I was a teen myself.

Among my two GR friends that shared my lukewarm opinion of this, both opined words to the effect of \"it's not the book, it's me\" when explaining why they could not connect with the narrative. I can't be that charitable. Melina Marchetta has the duty as author to bring her Taylor Markham protag to life, give the reader someone to cheer for, loathe, feel  something for, not surround her in a sea of murk and expect the reader to generate feelings for her plight. It's not even clear what her plight is, exactly. We learn she was, at age 11, abandoned by her drug-addled mother at a 7-11 store on the Jellicoe Road, we know she attends a boarding school with \"warring factions\" between classes and residence houses (never explained well, and never really factors in the story, anyway), we know she has a boy that likes her named Jonah Griggs, and she may or may not like him back. There's a few Kenny Rogers jokes (yeah, the '70's-80's country crooner...how au courant). There's more flashbacks than you can shake a stick at, and  none of them makes an iota of sense.

On the one hand, if they are done right, the story hooks you, and makes you need to know how the disparate scenes are connected, and how they got to be what you're seeing. Those kinds of stories are fantastic. On the other hand, there are stories like [On the] Jellicoe Road, which just plop you down in the middle of everything - present, past, dreams, etc - with everything melding together and creating this surreal stew, which leaves the reader utterly confused until such a time as the author decides to, I dunno, introduce a character mid-way through the book. This is the type of book that requires a patient reader... and a patient reader I am not. I tried starting this book on my Nook several times, and I just could not get into it. The opening line is fantastic, and the prologue always hooked me with a promise of this book being the kind that would speak to me in emotional terms... but then the book proper would lose me... every single time. It's just too jumbled, and the abrupt shifts of main character (which I didn't even realize until attempt #4 at starting this), perspectives and scenes just threw me off and I'd move to something less confusing... promising myself that another time I'd try again with Jellicoe. Then this book ended up being my real life bookclub book, and I determined to push through and actually finish it, because I'm determined to finish all of the bookclub books. But still I found it hard to actually READ this book. Maybe it was the formatting of my Nook copy, which is very... free-verseish? Not sure if this is how the actual book is or if there's a problem with my copy, but it was extremely distracting. So I said screw it and downloaded the audio from Audible. So now I've finished, and well... I don't know. For much of the book I was quite a bit less than impressed, but after the 60% mark the story actually DID start coming together and I was (finally) intrigued to see where it went. But having to trudge through 2/3 of a book in confusion is a LOT to ask of readers, especially (I think) teen and YA readers, which is the target audience. And, personally, I just don't think it was worth it. I think it could have been more coherent and written in a way that doesn't require the reader to have the patience of Job just to get to the part where the STORY starts. And this was especially true of the audio, because with that damn music leading and ending each chapter, it felt like each chapter was a series of individual snapshots rather than a story. Once the past and present storylines finally joined up I was almost fed up waiting for it.That being said, I did enjoy the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and Fitz. I enjoyed the message, that family is found in the most surprising situations and that we never know what the future will hold, so it's best to live and love in the moment. I also felt like this was a story of absolutes, the kind of absolutes that make moving on near to impossible because of the amount of oneself given into another person's care, and how dangerous that can be for the one who gives of themselves that way... you might never be able to be whole again. Not that that lesson was learned by the younger generation though, because even learning of Tate's struggles after loving someone so completely that she's literally incapable of functioning without him, Taylor jumps right onto that bandwagon and goes for the same kind of ride. Fuckin' insta-love.And that's all I'll say about that. I did actually like Jonah though. He was pretty funny, and as a love interest in a YA story, I can say with complete honesty that he's probably one of the most likeable and relatable I've read about in a long, long time. Just a smidge too-good-to-be-true, but at least he wasn't emotionally abusive or controlling or fucking psychotic like is apparently the IN THING in YA these days. So, overall, I was underwhelmed by this story. I wanted it to be great, and I wanted it to really wow me. But it just didn't. There were some great moments, some poignant scenes, and even a little tear may have been jerked toward the end... but then I kept waiting for it to end... and perfect endings were coming and going, and I'm sitting there thinking \"What is she waiting for? END THE STORY.\" I think the book should have ended at the end of Chapter 25. Maybe the epilogue would still be OK, because it doesn't need chapters 26 or 27 to exist. But it just kept going, and that again was an irritation, because it felt a little manipulative. Gotta squeeze out that last little bit of emotion by stretching the Tate & Taylor bit, wrapping up the Hannah & Jude, and the Taylor and Jonah romances, and tying everything with a lovely pink ribbon. There, finally finished. But ugh... I LIKE endings that leave the reader feeling satisfied with a resolution but not locked in with no room for post-read imagination or wonder. So... yeah. I wanted to like this a LOT more than I actually did. But at least I finished it, finally, thanks to Audible and 2x speed.

Now about the book and how I felt while and after reading. I was looking forward to read this book for ages. I had read so many 5-star reviews to this book that it never occured to me that I could be not charmed by it. The weird thing is, I tried to love it. I honestly did my best to find a way into the story and warm up for the characters and learn to love and suffer with them. Unfortunately, I didn't find my way into the story. The first 100 pages or so were meant to be confusing, well, to me they weren't. I sensed such a connection after, like 50 pages, and when everything came clear I just inwardly nodded and shrugged, because it was a bit obvious to me, really. Why else would an author connect two stories like that? And why else make them so \"tragic\"? The two main story-lines seemed a bit weak to me, by the way. I was highly annoyed with the war games. They seemed pathetic and useless to me, because well, they really had no use except for bringing Taylor and Griggs together. I actually wondered how people come up with such stupid games and ideas, while reading, I wondered whether there are people in the real world who act the way the characters acted. If such people exist I am persuaded that I should avoid these people, for otherwise the urge to strangle somebody may turn out to be stronger than my self-control. Taylor was pathetic. To me she was just pathetic and that's absolutely it. One second she was all analytic and serious and icy and the next she turned into an 'emotional' mess who hid somewhere in the corner. She was chewing on her 'problems' the whole bloody time instead of doing something, or accepting the past and getting over it and just living. It felt like Taylor was walking circles over and over again and I just wanted to slap her, hard, and walk away. What use is there from moping over your \"terrible-terrible\" life in your room? There is the world, there are responsibilities, things that have to be done.Her relationship with Griggs wasn't any better. It was \nbeyond weird\n and completely unrealistic to me. No real romance, and definitely no chemistry at all. Hannah could have acted in a more grown-up manner too, but well, I didn't judge her. As for the other characters...

I had heard that it was such an emotional, moving and beautiful contemporary, which are my favorite kind, (like The Sea of Tranquility and Hopeless) Alas, this was not the case for me. I could see where people would get that, and I could tell that the author was trying to make it be like that, but I was just never invested.Plot- The plot for this is very simple, yet very complicated all at once. The base plot is simple- Taylor's mother abandoned her a long time ago, and now she wants to discover her past. There's a lot more than that though, and at time it was very confusing. There were two parts to this story, the past and the present. At first, you're meant to not know how they connect, and then later it's revealed in a \"shocking\" twist, but I knew from the start how it all went together. This was a disappointment for me, because I wasn't shocked at any point in this book. I didn't like how nothing was really explained until over 100 pages in, I understand trying to keep \"an air of mystery\" but I think this one crossed the line a little too much. There was an interesting aspect of \"territory wars,\" which I liked, but that's pretty much the only time I was really interested in the story. I found it quite boring most the time, and I was never really caring what was going to happen next, thus making me not want to pick it back up whenever I put it down. I wasn't invested into the emotional side of the story either. I felt like it could have been done very well, but I wasn't attached. I liked what she tried to do however, and I appreciated how well it all connected, I just wish it was executed differently.Writing- This was definitely the book's strongest point. Marchetta has amazing writing. It's all very lyrical, and a lot of the time there are paragraphs where it feels like you're floating in a dream. At times, this can make the story hard to understand, but overall I really enjoyed this author's writing. I thought the dialogue had some humor to it a midst this darker plotline. I want to read more of her work, just to experience the writing again. It does my favorite thing: it's lyrical, but still feels real. It's not so poetic that it takes you away from reality, there's still some feel of the narrator's personality, and it's still believable.Characters- I also had major issues with the characters. I was not attached to any of them. I didn't really care for any of them at all, not even the main love interest, which usually I'll harbor some feelings for by the end of the book. I can acknowledge that the author didn't make them all the same, but none of them stood out to me, nor did I really like any of them, especially the characters from \"the past.\" It took me nearly until the end of the book to finally get it straight for who was related/in a relationship with who. I didn't care enough to pay attention to them, and they weren't memorable at all. I don't have much to say about them because I don't really remember them and it's only been one day. I do like that our main character got some type of character growth, and I really hold a lot of stock in that, so that did appease me. Even though separately I don't remember much about the characters, as a whole, I like how they were written. I liked their dialogue's with each other, and I liked how they interacted. Another major issue I had was there was really no descriptions on their physical appearance I can honestly say that besides Jonah, and Santangelo, I have no idea at all what any of the character's look like. That really bothered me, and it made me have a hard time getting into the story because I couldn't really picture any of the characters.Overall- Sadly, I don't think this was the book for me. I thought it was average in terms of an \"emotional contemporary.\" I appreciate what the author was trying to do, and I liked some of the unique things about it, but it just wasn't really my cup of tea. I didn't not like reading it, but just when I wasn't reading it, I didn't have any drive to get back into it. I don't think I will be recommending it to my friends, but I won't be swaying people away from reading it either. I'm still very interested to read her other works though because the writing was great, and I have faith that she can do much better.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1130336620", "review_id": "1130336620", "date": "Dec 12, 2014", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Clementine", "user_url": "/user/show/31037758-clementine", "text": "Well, at least once a month I pick up a book everyone loves that didn't work out for me.

That's probably because I'm Taylor in most ways. I'm a survivor and I didn't relate to this book. At all. I have lived through a car crash, saw my uncle's smashed body on the pavement and... I didn't think. Everyone's reactions in this book fell out of place to me. When someone dies in front of you, you don't think about what your little brother is going to see. You just don't think. You're not that bloody calm and rational about the whole thing. I hated how pretty the prose was to describe everything that was awful in a cute little way that wasn't visceral, that was so freakingly insightful. The right word, at the right time, while when someone dies in front of you it's messy and sticky and you're yelling. And yelling. And they take you away and you're still yelling. You never stop yelling, in fact. I hated how character's reactions were excused, a part of their personal tragedy. From murders to Taylor's attitude, everything was excused and no one addressed it. No one put their big people's pants and said: it's still wrong. In real life, there is no excuse. Oopsie-doopsie, the answer is in your past. The answer is in your parents' past. The answer is in my past, but it's not in your present. Coming of age sanction: denied! This is your story but it's not about you. This is what this book seemed to me. It was written from a survivor's point of view but it was really just about other survivors. It had too many layers of plot of another plot for me to relate. This was supposed to be Taylor's story, but it's not. It's about a serial killer, Hannah's past and her mother and her father and the Hermit's suicide and... not her. Never her. Oh, it's about her romance with a cadet too. But her? Psst. She will grow up once everyone's shit is figured out. She will forget her angst once she gets her tongue down her romantic interest's throat. Yeah, well no thanks. This book was 'meh' at best. A well written 'meh' that takes 200 pages to refrain from being so boldly and uselessly confusing. This had a The Lottery feel to it and it also failed where it did: oblivious adults, kids with more to their past, kids going to war for no freaking reason, kids fighting for no freaking reason, kids with history falling in love so they can forget their past together... I hate books with oblivious adults. I hate books that treat suicidal thoughts like something that doesn't creep in your mind to stay. I hate books that portray a suicidal individual who only needed to be told to not do it. It's not that easy, it's not that simple.I hate books with a plot that is really just: people are keeping secrets from you.I hate books that worry more about the prose than clarity or the main character's development.

Despite having always kept aloof from the other students, her senior status earns her the position of dorm head, leaving her in charge of waging the annual war the school students fight against the local Townies and the Cadets who make camp once a year on school grounds. It's difficult for Taylor to focus on winning back territory for the school when she's worried about the disappearance of the woman who's the closest thing she's ever had to a mother and when the head of the Cadets just happens to be the boy she ran away with four years ago. The escalating tensions among the groups lead to violence, and eventual revelations about a tragedy that happened on the Jellicoe Road oh-so-many years ago.One might be forgiven for initially mistaking Jellicoe Road for dystopian fiction. The curt prose paired with the emphasis on the battle among the warring factions (as well as the power dynamics which bring our outside heroine to leadership) feel more like the opening of The Hunger Games than anything else. I've actually taken part in dorm wars before, and while I'd never say we didn't take things seriously (We had dorm cheers.And jingles. And a bloody dress code.) at no point was the drama ratcheted up to Apocalypse the way it is here. Once you get past the first hundred pages or so, the feeling of trepidation that someone's going to throw a near sighted kid off a cliff eases a bit and it becomes clear we're in for more of a sins-of-the-past-generation-get-made-right-in-the-present kind of thing, with a few random bits of supernatural dreamquest thrown in for shits and giggles. It's here that the novel really starts to find itself, and becomes not just interesting but honestly affecting emotionally. I'd have gotten a bit sniffly, only the author opening with a 76th Annual Hunger Games vibe kind of warned me to not get too emotionally attached to anybody.Despite being a bit of a hot mess in an MFA project kind of way, Jellicoe Road clearly demonstrates Marchetta's promise as a writer.

I tried, but I couldn't bring myself to do so.I've probably lost count as to how many times I've seen someone telling me to read a Marchetta book. They all say that she's the best author and everyone needs to read one of her books and how their lives would be better. I can't say that this book changed my life. In all honestly, I'm starting to feel like Marchetta and her books are a bit overhyped. I always try to gives those books a shot and once I read them I can confirm my overhyped suspicions, which are almost always right, and I was right again here. I liked this book, it was simply fine for me, but I didn't love it and nothing really jumped out as being amazing or spectacular. I was expecting stellar and beautiful writing but I didn't really get that. Sure, there were some sprinkles of beautiful and deep writing here and there but it didn't feel consistent to me. My biggest problem was how long it took for this story to make sense. Like literally nothing made sense until the halfway mark. It all came together after that, but it shouldn't take that long for a contemporary book like this to make sense. I understood that this was about a mystery and of Taylor figuring out the story, all of that I didn't mind, but everything that had to do with Taylor's life and her world was a big question mark to me. I didn't understand the purpose of the territory wars or what they were even about and I couldn't see why they were of such importance. It felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story and was forced to go along with it even though I had just started it. The dual narratives definitely didn't help but once I saw that it was Hannah's story intertwined with Taylor's I didn't mind. And actually, I enjoyed that story more than Taylor's and I ended up enjoying how they intertwined and reflected one another. I think I connected more to Hannah's story than I did with Taylor's and I wish that this book was about that instead. There was far too much confusion in this book for me to actually enjoy it and it was almost as if it was too late once it all started making sense. I couldn't connect with the characters, the romance felt relatively bland and a bit choppy, and I just couldn't see the worth in all of it. It was fine, especially near the end, but not fantastic. I'll give Marchetta one more shot to impress me but if she doesn't I'll have no problem writing her off as overhyped.You can read a more detailed review of this book on my blog!!https://bookstrustandpixiedust.wordpr...", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": ["young-adult", "mystery", "contemporary"]}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1482271758", "review_id": "1482271758", "date": "Dec 27, 2015", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Aj Sterkel", "user_url": "/user/show/5790437-aj-sterkel", "text": "This book has phenomenal reviews on Goodreads, so I guess I\u2019m in the minority for not loving it.Seventeen-year-old Taylor is the leader of the secret \u201cterritory wars\u201d that happen every year between the students at her boarding school, the teenagers in the nearby town, and the Cadets who camp near the school\u2019s campus. When Taylor\u2019s guardian, Hannah, goes missing, Taylor starts reading the manuscript that Hannah left behind. As she puts together the clues in the manuscript, she discovers her own history and the history of the territory wars.There are a few elements of this book that I really like. First, it\u2019s set in rural Australia, which isn\u2019t a setting I\u2019ve seen very often before. I also like the slow way that the pieces of Taylor\u2019s life fall into place. The book starts out confusing because there are so many mysteries, but they are all solved by the end. I enjoyed trying to put the pieces together as Taylor uncovered more and more information. This novel is also very well-written, and I\u2019d love to read more of Melina Marchetta\u2019s work.Maybe I\u2019m too old for this book. I think teenage-me would have appreciated it more than twenties-me. I struggled with this novel because Taylor\u2019s angst got on my nerves. The beginning of this book is so mysterious that it\u2019s confusing, and I didn\u2019t understand why Taylor was so overdramatic about everything. Even after finishing the book, I didn\u2019t think she needed to be so angsty. I was constantly annoyed at her.Most of the book focuses on the territory wars, which I may be too old to find interesting. The territory wars are a game that the teenagers play. They invade each other\u2019s territory, take hostages, and negotiate for land around the school campus. Sometimes the players take the game too seriously, and somebody gets hurt. I found the territory wars childishly pointless. I think I would have liked the book a lot more if the wars had taken up less space. I considered giving up on the book several times because I just couldn\u2019t get invested in the wargames story.Finally, I wondered why Taylor\u2019s past is a mystery at all. Why couldn\u2019t the adults in her life just act like adults and talk to her about her parents? Why does her family history have to be a deep, dark secret? I don\u2019t get it.

There are two story lines - Taylor's present day struggle to figure out her family situation and find herself, and the story of what happened on Jellicoe Road 20-odd years ago. It's a complex novel and there's a lot to like about it. There's a nice romance and some really great characters. The first half of the book was confusing and frustrating and I would have put it down if I weren't urged to finish it by my fellow Cybils panelists. Eventually everything gets explained, but for me it took too long for everything to come together and the book was too long overall. Lots of people have loved this book, but for me the resolution wasn't worth the frustration in the first half.

I was going to try to split them out but I'm not sure how helpful that would be, so I'll just run through them all here.-The book doesn't give you a lot of clues to orient yourself, so it's hard to follow at first. I don't necessarily mind this in a book \u2014 sometimes it's fun to try to piece things together \u2014 but it's a solid third of the way through the book before you have any kind of clue WTF is going on. That was far too long for me and kept me from feeling connected to the main character because I couldn't understand her motives for a lot of what she did, much of which was being terrible to other people.-Once the pieces did start falling into place, I found it to be disappointingly predictable. I figured out who the Brigadier was chapters before Taylor did. If it was supposed to be a mystery, it didn't play out like one \u2014 it was more like everything was a confusing jumble, so I didn't even know what I was looking at, and then suddenly it all came into focus and I was just waiting for Taylor to catch up.-The writing felt much more like telling than showing. It was very choppy, a lot of \"This happened and then this happened and then this person said this.\" This meant that the romance felt underdeveloped and I had no real reason to root for them to get together or stay together, and the fact that they were either jumping each other or screaming at each other felt disconnected to any actual passion.-Also, Jonah is kind of a terrible person at the opening of the book, and he never really redeems himself. It's more like a combination of Taylor remembering him at his most vulnerable + he behaves like a halfway-decent person for a while. The characters are constantly throwing one-liners at each other, so we don't see who they are as individuals. At one point we're told something like, \"Jonah said some witty things to the girls,\" which just felt like lazy writing to me \u2014 tell us what the witty things were, and maybe we'll get some sense of his personality?-The underdeveloped writing also extended to plotting. One example: Taylor's bike gets stolen. Then there's a chapter where she's riding her bike into enemy territory. Then later her bike turns up again. We get no explanation \u2014 Was this a flashback? Did she borrow someone else's bike? No idea. Another example: The kids all get in the car together and they're driving and driving and Taylor is settling into the back seat and watching the colors go by the window, until she sees something and makes them all stop. When they get back in the car, the driver says, \"Where should we go?\" and they have a whole discussion about it and then start driving again. There's no reason that conversation couldn't have happened before they started driving initially, and it's unclear where exactly they were planning to drive to in the first place before they screeched to a halt and then had a conversation about it. This contributed to the feeling of being lost while reading, and it didn't feel intentional, just sloppy.-I am not a fan of magical realism, so all the pieces with the boy in the tree in Taylor's dream and how she named herself before she was born were a little eye-roll-y to me.I actually really liked the idea behind the book and I think I would have genuinely liked the book a lot had it been executed better. There's a sweet message about found family and laying aside differences and how we can come to terms with the past and move forward. And the interweaving of Hannah's book, as Taylor's reading it out of order, was a clever device. It was just unfortunate that we're told at the very beginning that Taylor's story opens \"twenty-two years later\" than the start of Hannah's story, because otherwise we, like Taylor, might think it was fictional until the coincidences with real life start happening.So, on the whole, I didn't hate the book, and I can understand why people like it (I was even tearing up a little bit at the end), but in general it was hard to get through and not enjoyable for me personally.", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/851576670", "review_id": "851576670", "date": "Feb 10, 2014", "rating": 2, "user_name": "Aria Alpha", "user_url": "/user/show/26172446-aria-alpha", "text": "WHY I READ IT: This book was recommended to us by our English teacher and was a required novel to read for study in class. Joining me for this review is Abbie, a friend from my class. We decided to give this book a two out of five, simply for our appreciation of the story, the characters and the writing style, when in fact, we did not particularly enjoy or like the book.SUMMARY (without including Hannah's story): Taylor Markam is not your average boarding school student. Having been abandoned by her troubled mother at a 7/11 when she was only a few years years old, she was found by a lady called Hannah, who brought her to her house and raised her as her own. Now seventeen, Taylor is selected to become the head of the Boarders at a rural Australian school in a series of territorial disputes between the school children / the Boarders, the Townies (children who live in the town), and the Cadets (who come every year for a couple of months). Taylor is not supported by her fellow students as she outcasts herself by removing her mind from her body and often taking a back-seat role in her life. Furthermore, she seems afraid of intimacy, as she declares in the first couple of pages, although it becomes apparent that she is not just anti-social, but pushes herself away from others (either to protect herself or to protect them from her, we know not). Taylor has a blemished history at the Jellicoe School, having run away with a Cadet when she was seven, only to be brought back by the Brigadier, a mysterious and somewhat under-used character whose persona is really rather confusing. (view spoiler)[When Hannah, Taylor's mentor, goes away suddenly, Taylor's already confusing life begins to spiral even further downwards. It turns out that the now head of the Cadets was the Cadet that she ran away with, Jonah Griggs, and that her seemingly only female friend has been in a relationship of some sort with the head of the Townies, Santangelo. The story progresses and the Territory Wars seem to decrease in complexity and interest as Hannah's quest for self-identity becomes the focus of the story. Hannah finally returns to Sydney while her romantic relationship with Griggs progresses and as she looks for her mother. Eventually, she finds out that the characters in Hannah's story were actually real - Narnie is Hannah, another character is her mother and others in the story also have ties to Taylor. (hide spoiler)]WHAT I LIKED: I'm a positive person, so I am going to start with what I enjoyed about the book. Ms. Marchetta, you write a good Jonah Griggs. Griggs is not your typical manly man or your artsy fellow, but he was a character who I found unique and relatable. He was a beacon of hope, having overcome suicidal thoughts with the concepts of love. How romantic. And of course, separately, the two stories of the different times are well written, unique, and engaging. I personally loved the first two pages. It seemed throughout the book, even from the very start, there were moments of hope, despair and life's wisdom in this novel that made it worth the read. Parts of the imagery and details are fabulous and a pleasure to read. The style of the time jumps are interesting. I am not saying that I appreciated and/or enjoyed them, as I am quite an impatient reader, but they were interesting. I also liked the diversity of the characters in this book. It is not often that you find people of such diverse opinions, backgrounds, ideas and pasts who can relate to one another. They are all perfectly developed and complemented one another. Let's leave the positives for now and talk about what we did not completely like about this book. Please do not be offended by anything that we have said or will say below. Book critiquing is a matter of opinion, so you are perfectly entitled to yours. I hope that you believe the same about us.WHAT I DISLIKED: While we recognised that the story was broken into both Hannah's book/past and Taylor's present-day life, it seemed to be extremely disjointed without purpose. On the Jellicoe Road certainly played on the shock value. Taylor had many issues, too many, it seemed at points, to make her a feasible 17 year old. She'd suffered under a pedophile. She'd been abandoned by her drug addict mother. Her confidante and mentor, Hannah, had simply and randomly disappeared, and had always been distant towards her compared with the obvious love she had shown other boarding school students. She had run away from home. She had witnessed a person committing suicide. She had no ability to feel emotion until halfway through the story, at which time it seemed unlikely that she would ever do so, but she radically changed and 'came out of her bubble' and started to live her own life. Her boyfriend had tried to commit suicide. Her father was not present throughout her childhood. She had lived in the worst parts of Sydney as a young girl. She had never had any real friends as she was afraid to love. While at times all these past issues made Taylor a deep, wizened and loveable voice and narrator, at other times, we had to put down the book and talk about how realistically a teenager would have had all those experiences.Another evident issue was the fact that the story was unrealistic. Coming into the novel, reading the back cover, looking at the front cover (I know that we shouldn't judge a book by the cover, however it is still good to look at it), doing a little background research of the plot line and reading a couple of reviews, we certainly did not expect the story to be what it was. A slightly confusing plot line, jumping noticeably and irrationally, between the past and the present, it was not clear to the reader what the purpose of the italicised text was for quite a ways into the novel. Getting started was the hardest part of the book. We had been forewarned that we should read at least up until page 100 before we made our judgements, but to be honest, we both found it hard to get past the first chapter. I enjoyed the first two pages and Taylor's narration of the dream she had been having, but beyond that, I saw no life in the story. I put the book down, but came back to it the next day. It took me several cups of coffee and tea to finish. It was not, at least in my view, a story that was hard to put down - rather, it was hard to pick up. Well! A lot of text for the negatives there. While I did not like many things about the book, it is a definitely re-read for me. I think, then, I would probably enjoy it more. Also, I spent quite a lot of time talking about what I did not like - not because I didn't like it, but rather, because it is quite hard to explain.QUOTES:\"My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. I counted.\" Wow. That hooked me from the beginning. That's the kind of writing I love. I really liked how it tied back to the ending with Taylor's mother taking seventeen years to die.\"...there is no place in my life for sentimentality.\" This phrase sums up Taylor in a couple of words. I find this concept so beautifully endearing, yet so estranged from me that I just had to include it.Matthew 10.26 - 'So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.' This is one of my favourite Bible verses, so it really made the story personal to me.It's too long to include but the beginning of Chapter 15 was stunning. It was this kind of passage that made me want to keep reading, when it started to drag slightly.THE ENDING: The best part of the book. That is all. With the smattering of inspiration throughout the novel, the ending really brought the full on impact of these ideas.RECOMMENDATIONS: As hard as it is to confess that this book was not one that we enjoyed, I suppose that I will have to recommend it because it was not a book I hated. It was thought-provoking. Anyway, this is a book for those who like a challenge to read. Those who read deeply and carefully. Those who like their heroines on the front line, not just calm, collected girls with that one amazing friend.

I'm conflicted and a bit angry. I've heard such incredible things about this book, and it has a high rating, but I spent most of my time reading it waiting for it to be over. The problem is that we're thrown into this world with a hundred characters that never get fully developed, which makes it hard to care about any of them. I could barely keep track of any of these characters, especially when they all start mingling. The majority of the book is taken up with the \"wars\" that go on between the kids, and my issues with those are that 1) they're never fully explained and we're supposed to just understand them and go with it, and 2) the apparent reason that teachers have never catch on to these games that have been going on for decades is simply because the turnover rate is so high. My point is that too much time is wasted on the wars, which quickly become irrelevant when suddenly everyone stops beating each other up or holding each other hostage and starts making out and throwing a giant party for all three groups. We spend more than half of the book with these characters hating each other, and in the blink of an eye, all negative feelings are erased. The book completely changes its tone, and everyone is happy and lovely and gets along. Even the main character, Taylor, suddenly becomes more likeable and bearable, and everyone starts to care about her. She magically falls in love with a boy she held a grudge against for years.The final 100 pages of the book are truly the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me forgive it, considering I spent 300 pages questioning what the plot of the story was or if we'd ever get one (spoiler alert: we really don't). The book is scattered with snippets of a book that a character named Hannah wrote, and they turn out to be flashbacks of her teenage years. The problem is that they start way too early in the book, so they're lost within the first pages, and by the time the reader realizes what they are or why they're important, they already missed half the story. One hiccup I caught was that when one of the cadets tells Taylor \"His name is Xavier,\" Taylor doesn't flinch, but when he says his full name, she reacts. But if Taylor read all of Hannah's story in one sitting, she would know his full name, because there are times he's called by both his first and middle names. I know they're inconsistencies and I'm probably nitpicking, but if you're going to write a book about four characters and their parallels to five characters from 20 years ago, consistency is key. I don't know. I was expecting so much more from this, and I wonder if everyone else who loved it was initially as thrown off as I was. The difference is that everyone else probably forgave the rocky beginning and got their hearts ripped out by the ending, while I grew more impatient with the logistics as the story went on.

The book goes on and on for ages with nothing in particular happening. It has two storylines running side by side.

And another one running about 22 years earlier which through the course of the book we realise is about Hannah and Taylor\u2019s parents and their friends. I had a problem with this book on the issue of the territory wars. I found it hard to imagine these \u201cwars\u201d and even harder to imagine any teenagers to refer to an ages old notebook containing the regulations on which these wars were said to be waged without wanting to make any amendments themselves. In the end the wars were practically inconsequential to the storyline anyway so the author could have left them out. Ridiculous also is how Hannah never tells Taylor that she is her aunt and her father\u2019s sister, and also that she always kept Taylor at arm\u2019s length. The pathetic explanation that Tate told her not to mother her because she already had a mother really ruins it. I mean what would you do, respect the wishes of a junkie who can\u2019t even respect her own child or show some love to a poor abandoned eleven-year-old?

For one, it's one of those books that just throws you into the action without explaining ANYTHING and leaving you scrambling to figure out what the hell is going on. The first 100 pages were extremely painful to get through because it was so confusing. To add to the confusion, a million and a half characters are thrown at you in those first 100 pages and you're expected to keep track of who's a Cadet and who's a Townie and who the five people are in the italicized sections that don't seem to have anything to do with the other plot you're trying to keep track of. Another thing that bugged me was that the author gave very few physical descriptions of characters. That should be introduced early on because it helps readers picture who they're reading about. For some of the characters, descriptions were revealed throughout the book, but for almost all of them, we never got to know what they looked like. I liked how the two plots came together (even though I would say it was pretty predictable--I was not shocked at all), and I really liked the ending.

They tell me how good it is and other things that equate to a red blinking sign screaming HYPE! HYPE! HYPE! Books that are overhyped and I typically don't get along and so I resisted and then I tried it and I put it down after a chapter. I tried this several times and each time I kept putting it down and telling people that it probably wasn't for me even though I adored Finnikin of the Rock, Froi of the Exiles and Quintana of Charyn. Everyone then told me that I had to read past 150 in order to 'get' Jellicoe Road and to fall in love with it. 150 pages?!?! That is almost half way through the book and long past my cut off mark. It shouldn't take 150 pages for a story to get good. Then I made a deal with Andi of AndiABCs, I would read\u00a0Jellicoe Road if she read Finnikin of the Rock. As my love for\u00a0Finnikin\u00a0knows no bounds this was determination enough to plow through the angst filled book that was\u00a0Jellicoe Road.Oh my stars was this book filled with angst and unnecessary conflicts and drama! The adults were all\u00a0selfish and petty putting their wants and needs over the wellfare of those around them. The teens were all so unlikable, especially Taylor, who was the narrator of most of the book. This made it hard to get into the story because I just didn't care about anyone. I also don't get what the big deal is over Jonah Griggs who is nothing more than a bully for much of the book. Then there is the mystery, the story within a story that is supposed to big this big mysterious, edge of your seat thing. The reveal of which is supposed to be so mind blowing that it makes the whole slow moving boring ass book worthwhile. And yet...I figured things out at the beginning of the book\u00a0so the big reveal kind of fizzeled and I was left thinking...\"That's it?\" If these characters just communicated with each other and didn't keep such big secrets for pointless, selfish reasons then most of the 'conflict' in this book could have been resolved before the story had even started.I did managed to get to the end of\u00a0Jellicoe Road but it was a struggle. I forced myself to turn the pages and it was hard not to fall asleep as it was so darn boring. Kids running around the Australian outback angsting over war games and territory and how they are all broken and oh woe is me. I found myself rolling eyes and sighing the heavy sighs of frustration a lot while reading this one as there seemed to be no point or purpose to the book. This is one that I intially rated as a three star read but the more that I think about it the more I feel that rating was wrong and geared more towards all those I know love the book than my actual reaction. So I've lowered my rating and have given away my book and am just done with\u00a0Jellicoe Road. I've heard that Marchetta's other contemporaries have that similar 150 page rule so I think that I might just avoid those as well and just stick with her fantasy novels because its just such a different feel to her writing in those and I just like them so much better.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n.\u00a0.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review was originally posted on Ticket to Anywhere\n", "num_likes": 0, "sort_order": "default", "shelves": []}, {"book_id_title": "1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road", "book_id": "1162022", "book_title": "On the Jellicoe Road", "review_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4327108513", "review_id": "4327108513", "date": "Nov 11, 2021", "rating": 2, "user_name": "LB", "user_url": "/user/show/27871126-lb", "text": "I feel very left out for not enjoying this book\u2026 The first 200 pages are about these territory wars between kids that make little to no sense.

The dialogues, especially the ones with banter, felt unnatural and far-fetched, as I could imagine the author squeezing jokes and teen taunting scenes out of herself.I didn't like the main character. One chapter she's snappish and cold, in another she's all sentimental and caring. As for the other characters, they were too many and none of them has any particular personality, and, as a result, I found it quite difficult to care about anyone. The scene with the House on fire is presented as something horrible and impressive, but if fact, did anyone give a shit about those students whom we don't know? Or Jessa and who, Chloe? Who are they? I mean, I know who they are, but I don't know much about them to be interested in their fate.Moreover, I didn't like that trick of throwing the reader into the mess of the book without any explanation - reading first chapters felt useless as, not caring for the happening and the featuring characters, I didn't and didn't want to understand the situation that was going on. And when it's finally all clear, we're given a few dull scenes and the book is over.The ending is super cheesy and reminds one of a melodramatic film. Also, as the story developed, I had a strong feeling of the author having got tired of writing her novel, because I can't explain that decline in the writing quality closer to the end.

It makes me sad that I didn't like it. I wanted to. This is a good book. I just didn't like it. It is a sad, lovely book but there were some aspects that I just became hung up on and it led to me not liking the book in the end. There was a point in the book where the tragedy turned into melodrama and I just started rolling my eyes. It was the fire. The fire was the point where I turned from loving this book to not liking this book. It was unnecessary and it took me completely out of the story. I never felt like anyone was in any real danger from the fire and it was just one more tragedy on top of all the other tragedies. It really made me think of a Lifetime movie. Believe me, I love a Lifetime movie, but I love it for the cheesy drama, not because it is particularly poignant and moving. Towards the end of the book, I started feeling like there was some kind of checklist of tragedies that were being crammed in there and there was already plenty in this book. By the time I got to the fire, I couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes. The fire also led me to focus on how completely awful all of the grownups are in this book. Raffy is listing off all the kids and what families they are going to stay with and details on all of them while the house mother just stands there. Then I started thinking about how much I disliked all of the adults. They take no responsibility for the kids at all. Teachers usually like kids and want to work with kids. That\u2019s why you go into teaching. I understand that these teachers usually moved on when their time was up at the Jellicoe School, but I can\u2019t believe that none of them seemed to care at all about these kids. None of them. Taylor\u2019s aunt? Forget it. She\u2019s terrible. I understand that she has her own tragedies and is emotionally stunted, but she can\u2019t come up with some way to connect with her own niece? Ugg. Just ugg. She\u2019s the worst.I could really rant for quite some time about all of the adults in this book and their total neglect of the kids that needed them so much. I just found them to be horrible people. I didn\u2019t really buy the romance between Taylor and Jonah. I can understand why they feel drawn to each other. They are both very troubled kids who need professional help (as do most of the kids in this book although only Jonah gets any) and I find it completely believable that they would cling to each other. I just couldn\u2019t be swept along by it because I was too distracted about how troubled these kids were and how much help they really needed and how their love was really just them clinging to each other to escape the reality of their lives. I feel like I was supposed to be seeing them as true soul mates and I just couldn\u2019t. I was really excited about the Territory Wars. Sadly, I thought they were better in theory than in execution. For me, that didn\u2019t really go anywhere. All of that being said, this is a good book. It has some lovely characters and lovely moments. I loved Taylor. Her voice was so raw and painful at times that I couldn\u2019t breathe. She felt so real. I just felt like there were too many bad things shoved in there and I couldn\u2019t help but be distracted by the fact that no one seemed to really care about these kids.

I don\u2019t feel that JR found that balance, at least not for me.That\u2019s not to say that no joy happens in this book, there is definitely joy there, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s battling desperately against this choking depression and sadness and grief pretty much the whole time. I do think that the themes it tackles (abandonment, death, depression, a whole bunch of other stuff, etc.) are presented extremely well and I really applaud how Marchetta handled all of it, it was tactful without pulling any punches. Unfortunately, that\u2019s just not my jam as far as books go! I would rather read something with like an 85/25 light to dark ratio than 45/55, but that\u2019s just my preference. If you prefer your books with a healthy dose of emotional trauma, please pick this up because you will love it. Here Is The Nitty Gritty Bone-Picky Stuff:An avalanche of terrible things happens to the characters in this book. So many things that by the last thing I was like \u201cdamn, really????? this on top of everything????\u201d, like it was A Lot. It sort of felt like the point of the book was to make as many bad things as possible happen to these characters, which I find extremely irritating as a plot device.Another thing worth mentioning that I struggled with was the structure: it started out fairly confusing at the beginning, partly because 1) I didn\u2019t know that it was set in Australia until like 100 pages in, and the language was throwing me off (whoops), and 2) there are flashbacks of people from the beginning of the book throughout and you don\u2019t find out what their connection is to the main characters of the story, or even begin to suspect it, until at least \u00bc through the book. It felt like a long time of trying to remember what the names and purposes of these characters are and what\u2019s going on in their lives while being unable to connect any dots. Ironically, once the first dot is connected for you, you can immediately guess who everyone is - but it takes the characters another like 2/3 of the book to get to that point. Ugh. It was supposed to be compelling, but it just left me frustrated. Once everything is in place plot-wise, it does flow nicely to the end, but it was definitely a struggle to get there.What About The Good Stuff?As negative as this review has been, I want to stress that this book is not a bad book. It is a good book where bad things happen. Despite the initial struggle to get things on track and making sense, once things do get underway you really get sucked in with the characters and it all ties together in a really poetic way that feels satisfying. The characters are all really lovable and good in a way that feels realistic, which is important to me. I felt the relationships between the main characters could have used some work in the beginning, but once they get there, they\u2019re really lovely relationships. All good things!

And I mean that pretty literally, as I found this to be an exceedingly and unnecessarily confusing book. While there may be some merit to the reader being invited into the mystery and confusion with Taylor, I found the jumbled retelling of Hannah's story to be a huge impediment to actually following it, which I realized nearly 100 pages in was going to be a big problem as it's such a significant aspect of the story. I just couldn't keep the characters from that segment straight, they all sort of blended together for me in the same nonlinear swirl their story was told in. So much of the narrative was written as a mystery, but I honestly think it would have worked much better as a more straightforward story without the gimmicks (we could have just known the backstory between Hannah and Griggs up front, Hannah's story could have been told in chronological order, etc.). It's not even that I don't enjoy more creative, innovative writing...for whatever reason it just really didn't work well for me. Beyond that, I had trouble really investing in the other characters (to the point where, again, I literally wondered if I'd read the wrong book after seeing the fanfare for Griggs on here) and they felt pretty thinly drawn to me. I feel like there were some glaring examples of telling rather than showing throughout the book and that's how much of the serious progression happened. We're told that the various leaders begin spending time together and talking about life and so on, but all we see is the initial interactions which made it hard to buy the depth of their bonds later on. We're told Taylor develops a deep love for the girls she oversees after hearing her complaints towards them the bulk of the book without really seeing it. I know I'm in the radical minority here, but there was a serious shortage of depth and richness to the characterization, relationship-building, and plot development for me, and mostly for the sake of constant conversation around territory wars that had radically little bearing on the meat of the story. With all of that said, I did enjoy the final 150 pages of the book quite a bit, which was when the storytelling felt most straightforward and the bulk of the revelations took place, seemingly one after another.

But all it did was confuse me.I loved Finnikin of the Rock, so I wanted to check out more of Marchetta\u2019s books, and I\u2019d heard lovely things about this one. Unfortunately, everything about it was a mess for me: the plot, the setting\u2026I was just so turned around.So apparently the people at this boarding school of sorts are involved in territorial wars that were started years ago, but nobody really knows why the wars continue, and what their point is? The logic behind these territorial wars was poorly-explained, and I got lost in all the seemingly nonsensical rules involved in the war. My confusion made it difficult for me to picture the setting vividly because I was devoting too much time to trying to figure out what the heck was going on.In addition to the territorial wars, Taylor, our MC, is also struggling with the disappearance of Hannah, who found Taylor on the Jellicoe Road years ago and has been a supportive constant in her life ever since her mother abandoned her. As Hannah\u2019s absence is prolonged, Taylor begins probing into Hannah\u2019s past\u2026and learns more about her own.It turns out Hannah\u2019s past is actually much more closely connected to Taylor\u2019s than Taylor ever could have imagined, and we get snippets of this past throughout the book. However, the way these snippets are interwoven with the main plot (whatever the heck the main plot was, anyway) makes this aspect of the book just one more layer of confusion, and the final twist was so vaguely explained that I actually had to look up a summary of the twist because I\u2019d read it three times and was still confused. Thus, there was never any payoff for me.I can see glimmers of good intention in this book, however. There are some touching, well-written moments where we see the impact of Taylor being abandoned (by more people than just her mom), and where we see her trying to grow into her own identity.
