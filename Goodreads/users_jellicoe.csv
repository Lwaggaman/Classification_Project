But it was worth it.Melina Marchetta never fails to remind me why she is one of my favourite authors and, in my opinion, this is the best of her books I've read so far. It's very difficult to put into words how I feel about On the Jellicoe Road. All I can say is that my heart has been ripped out and shredded, my throat has sealed up with emotion, and when I finally get some sleep, I get the feeling I'll probably dream about Jonah Griggs.The story is of Taylor Markham, a girl who was abandoned by her mother as a young child and now resides in a boarding school for kids who are troubled, neglected or criminally inclined. Her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. Taylor tries to balance this responsibility with her own worries about Hannah's sudden disappearance and her belief that it is connected to her mother. On top of that, there's her relationship with Jonah Griggs, one of the Cadets and a boy from her past, who knows her a little too much for comfort.This is so much more than a typical YA book. I want to tell everyone to read this, scream praise from the rooftops, and glare with disapproval at the teens in my local library until they drop Halo and pick up these fantastic works of fiction. Saving Francesca, The Piper's Son, On the Jellicoe Road... every book I read seems better than the last. She creates moods that permeate the entire book so even the most simplistic scenes or conversations become deeply emotional, and Melina Marchetta plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar. I can't think of a single book that has had me choked up more than this one.And Jonah Griggs, you stole my heart. Though I do think Melina Marchetta could quite easily persuade me to fall in love with a goldfish. Basically this book is everything... beautiful, powerful, tragic without being melodramatic, and I know this wonderfully sad story will stay with me for a very long time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube",412,default,"['young-adult', '2011', 'contemporary']"

They don't give those to just any book, and when you factor in excellence . . . well, a lot of titles just don't make the cut. But it is clear to me why Melina Marchetta's third tribute to YA literature received a Printz award back in 2009. It is because it is excellent, to the very meaning of the word.If all YA contemporary writers wrote like Marchetta, I doubt I'd play in any other genre playground very often. She writes these beautifully inspirational, relatable, and emotionally-charged novels that seem to affect me in an undescribable way. Some of the passages in Jellicoe Road seem to beat with their own heart:""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.""""'What do you want from me?' he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More.""I've always believed that an exceptionally good writer can take you places emotionally that others can't, and, for me, Melina Marchetta is one of those writers. I'm going to end this review here for two reasons: 1) I believe this is the type of book that should be experienced first hand, without much knowledge of the story going in. So, go read it and remember, the beginning is confusing, but plow through it and I promise you won't regret it; 2) I'm tearing up thinking about this story and its characters, so all you'll be getting from me is the aforesaid and this: I love this book and I'm anticipating the day when I can read it again. I highly recommend Jellicoe Road to everyone.Oh, and one more thing: I ♥ Jonah Griggs.",326,default,"['favorites', 'lib-read', 'aussies-rock-my-world', 'g-ya-realistic', 'summer-reads', 'want-to-reread', 'quality-ya-fic']"

But not every will love this book. I will also preface this review by saying that you shouldn't decide whether you belong in group A or group B before you get to page 125 or so. The first 125 pages are a confusing, emotional slog that seems to be about territorial ""wars"" between rival teen sects in Australia. But it's really brilliantly done -- because that is exactly what the main character, Taylor Markham, thinks of things. It's busy and there are plot threads everywhere and all I knew was that I loved SAVING FRANCESCA and Melina Marchetta was doing all of this for a reason. And she was. It ties up beautifully in the end, and there's a scene which even made me shed a tear -- me, who has not cried since THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (three tears) and while writing my second novel SHIVER (one tear from each eye) -- and I'm left feeling just about cheerful about everything in the book though it was not a Hollywood happy ending by any stretch. I think quite possibly my absolute favorite thing that Marchetta does is the character reversal. She introduces a character which we view in a terrible light because the main character views them in a terrible light, and then she completely changes our mind about them in a subtle and realistic way throughout the book until finally we and the main character are in love. She did this in SAVING FRANCESCA and she pulled it off again in JELLICOE ROAD even though I was watching for it. By the time we get the first kiss in the novel, I was sort of clapping embarrassingly like a seal. This is one of those books that I know will be wonderful on the reread, because I'll get to look past the busy beginning to see the groundwork Marchetta was laying. Happy sigh. I'm very happy this one won the Printz this year.***wondering why all my reviews are five stars? Because I'm only reviewing my favorite books -- not every book I read.

Gorgeous*Books like this make me realize just how insignificant words become when attempting to convey raw emotion. On the Jellicoe Road is more than just a book; it is a hauntingly beautiful journey towards an unexpected destination where tragedy and despair become the bridges to the greatest of friendships. 

And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.

This story is told in alternating perspectives set in both past and present which, at first, seem entirely unrelated. But as the mysteries of this plot unravel, they begin to show hints of their glorious connection. If you find yourself confused or frustrated at first, don't give up - you are strategically been fed only pieces to a larger puzzle that will all fit together nicely in the end. The character development in this story is extraordinary; no one is denied the sweetness of redemption and transformation. Seventeen year old Taylor Markham has been living on the Jellicoe Road after being abandoned by her mother at a local 7-11. The school she attends partakes in traditional games of territory wars where Taylor eventually becomes a leader. Taylor is tormented by the grief and uncertainty of her abandonment and keeps herself emotionally distant from others. She has few memories of her childhood, but when her history starts presenting itself she begins a relentless quest for answers. The writing in this story is captivating as it flows methodically from one vivid scene to the next. Taylor's character, as broken as she appears, is actually quite funny in a dry and witty, sarcastic sense - which is my favorite type of humor. I appreciated being able to smile and laugh in the midst of such angst-ridden scenarios. Taylor's love interest, Jonah, is equally damaged and initially comes across as arrogant and crude. But, as their gentle relationship develops, it not only becomes one of the most loving but also one of the most inspiring. 

Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.

 Every single element and occurrence in this book is connected to some larger piece of the story. Everything. Most connections are prominent enough to take your breath away, but then there are those as subtle as whispers, and if you're not careful enough you just may miss them. I was still connecting the dots even after the book was done. The way this author seamlessly executes this perfect union of all that exists though past and present is truly astonishing. Touching messages of hope, love, and determination tugged at me endlessly while reading this book. This story brought me to tears - from being just so deeply moved and so humbly inspired.

Normally these are the books that either horrify me (Unwind, The Handmaid's Tale) or delight me with superb writing (The Queen of Attolia, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks) or awe me with imaginative world building (The Left Hand of Darkness) or make me cry (Before I Die). Jellicoe Road definitely falls into this last ""made-me-weep"" category.Jellicoe Road is the location of a boarding school for kids that are often neglected or with criminal tendencies. Taylor Markham is residing in the school because her mother had abandoned her at the age of 11 at a nearby 7-Eleven. Now Taylor is 17 and unexpectedly selected to be the school's leader in the game of territory wars with the Townies (locals from a tiny neighboring town) and Cadets (who spend several weeks a year in the Australian wilderness). Taylor is not sure she can handle the responsibility. She is uneasy more than ever - her mentor and friend Hannah disappears and Taylor is sure it has something to do with her mother; Jonah Griggs, a Cadet who she has a shared past with, is back and seems to know her all too well; she is plagued by dreams of a young boy who attempts to tell her something. What follows is Taylor's journey through the past and present to uncover the reasons why and how she was abandoned by her mother. As always, it is hard for me to explain what I like about a 5-star book, but I'll try. Melina Marchetta draws characters that are deep, complex, and real. The relationships among them are touching - more than anything I think, this book is about the power of friendship and, boy, there are some magnificent examples of friendship in this book! The book is also about grief, guilt, forgiveness and, of course, love.If I am forced to point out any flaws in this book, I'd say the writing some might find confusing in the beginning. It takes a few pages to figure out what is a dream and what is a page from a story Taylor is reading; what is from present and what is from the past. But soon enough all pieces of the puzzle fall together and you are faced with a deep, meaningful and heartbreaking story. Another thing that might bother readers is that some characters go through a lot of tragic events, sometimes too many. However, the story never becomes overly melodramatic or emotionally manipulative IMO. Jellicoe Road is a remarkable work of YA fiction and rightfully deserves the Printz award it was given in 2009. I have no doubt I will read Marchetta's books in future.",164,default,"['ya', '2010', 'favorites', 'aus-nz', 'printz']"

After all of the glowing reviews for this one, I was prepared to be blown away. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out that way for me. It ended up being an ""okay"" story for me.My first problem has less to do with the actual story, and more to do with the format that I chose. I listened to the Audible edition and that was a big mistake. The problem didn't stem from the quality of narration, so much as the complexity of the story. There were simply too many moving parts for me to try and keep track of while listening to an audiobook. It is incredibly hard to pull off a book like this in audiobook format and it didn't work for me.I spent hours trying to figure out who the characters were and what the hell was going on. The transitions between characters and time frames was not always obvious, making matters even worse. I must have been hours into the story before I figured out that there were actually two stories playing out -- one in the present and one in the past. Needless to say, I lost a lot of time being utterly confused and unaware of what was going on. By the time I began to piece some things together, I had already missed so many of the ""connections"" and details that it was kind of pointless. When the big reveals came toward the end, they were kind of meaningless to me. I never really connected with the characters or the storyline. I had simply missed too much to play catch-up at that point.The story centers on Taylor Markham, a girl that was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road by her mother at the age of 11. She lives at a boarding school (orphanage???). When the lady that has taken care of her disappears, she is certain that something is amiss. Taylor sets out to find Hannah, or discover what really happened to her. When she runs across a book/journal written by Hannah, she begins to unveil some long-standing secrets. Along with some friends from her school, she has several creepy encounters and a variety of adventures. There is some sort of rivalry described between the two groups of kids...but I was pretty confused so I can't say I ever really grasped what that was about for sure.Overall, this ended up being a middle of the road story for me. I do suspect that I'm not doing this story justice though. I was just too lost for most of the book to take much away from the experience this time around. I do plan to re-read this in the future, because I have some lingering questions. I'm sure they were answered along the way and I just didn't catch it. I definitely won't be listening to the audiobook on my second attempt. This story will require my full attention.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com ",150,default,"['childhood-loves', 'listened-to-audio-version', 'dark-themes', 'forbidden-romance', 'wtf-did-i-just-read', 'shocking-twists']"

This quote belongs to Stephen King, but it describes the soul of Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road perfectly.Jellicoe Road is the story of friendships that form your world, friendships so wonderful that it's easy to fall to pieces when they break. It is the story of abandonment and loss and learning to deal with it. It is the story of love, intense to the extreme with the generous helping of teen angst. In short, it is an excellent example of a good quality YA book, emotional, intense, and lyrical.""I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.""Here's a short spoiler-free synopsis: Taylor Markham was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is now 17, living in Jellicoe School, a boarding school full of state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House (50 girls) and is expected to lead a sixteen-year-old 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids, the 'Townies' and the Cadets who camp out in the area for a couple of months each year. All while having strange dreams and feeling abandoned by her caretaker Hannah. All while reading Hannah's unfinished novel about five teenagers in the 1980s who form very intense friendship bonds after the horrific car accident on Jellicoe Road when they were 11-12 years old.Now, I have to say that not once did I look at this book as a mystery even though it's marketed as such. The central mystery of the story - well, I easily figured it out only a few chapters in, and the rest of the details easily came into light as the story developed. Not much took me by surprise; it was quite predictable, actually. But since the mystery was not why I enjoyed the story, the reading experience was perfectly fine. To use the book's own language, the whole mystery setup was not a trip but a journey. It was never about the resolution but about the emotional journey it took to get there.""I remember asking, ""What is the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,"" and that was the last thing he ever said.""What I loved was the friendships that the 'old five' and the 'new five' have developed throughout the course of their respective stories. My favorite by far was between Taylor and Raffaela, with the developing friendship with annoying but adorable Jessa as a close second. Even though there was a romantic story threatening to take the foreground, it never overshadowed the rest of the story and the friendships, and I'm thankful for that.""This is the best night of my life,"" Raffy says, crying.""Raffy, half our House has burnt down,"" I say wearily. ""We don't have a kitchen.""""Why do you always have to be so pessimistic?"" she asks. ""We can double up in our rooms and have a barbecue every night like the Cadets.""Silently I vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of my life."" I was quite emotionally affected (I'd say 'manipulated' if not for the negative connotation of that word) by the nostalgic atmosphere Marchetta creates here. The nostalgia for the beauty of childhood and adolescence, for the friendships of the kind that you can only have before you reach adulthood, for the safety of childhood (no matter how messed up it can be), for the safe haven of Jellicoe School for the lost and messed up children. I also loved Marchetta's excellent characterization. Her characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional, and feel quite real. That is not to say that there's no stereotyping or clichés, but those are kept to the minimum.""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.""As for the voice of the novel - it is very emotional. Please be warned - it is emotional with the generous helping of teen angst. Oh, teen angst! It's on every page, in every sentence - just like it was so overwhelming when you were 16-17. Everything is intense, the tension is palpable, emotions are right on the surface. Reading this book is like experiencing being a teenager you once were. I found it to be a bit of eye-rolling experience initially (thankfully, I'm way out of the adolescence) but eventually the style grew on me and started to feel quite organic. But if you'd rather not deal with overexaggerrated raw teenage emotions - well, be warned and stay away from this story. ""What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.""------------------------------Now, here are the issues that I had with this book that forced me to knock off a star:- The Territory wars. I thought that storyline was limping on both feet. Why all the intensity if the whole thing only takes place for about 2 months each year? Why the whole issue with the Club House when it's only a few weeks when it becomes relevant? Honestly, just setting up a rivalry between the 'factions' would have been enough for the story. (view spoiler)[Especially since about halfway through the story any of that territory stuff becomes completely irrelevant as nobody pays any attention to it anymore (hide spoiler)].- Sometimes the emotional intensity slips into a blatant melodrama. I mean, there was actually a remark on (view spoiler)[how intense Taylor and Jonah's relationship was, which made me feel like I'm reading a Twilight-type love story (hide spoiler)].- The adults in this book (even Taylor remarks on it!). Seriously, what the hell is going on with the adults? (view spoiler)[Hannah and Jude, I'm looking at you! You and your minimal interference into the lives of the children of your best friends! And what's with keeping the parentage of Jessa and Taylor secret? Especially Taylor? I know Hannah promised Tate to not 'mother' Taylor, but what exactly was the reason why she could not tell the abandoned girl that she, Hannah, is her paternal aunt? How would it have hurt Taylor to know that????? (hide spoiler)]- Taylor and Jonah: (view spoiler)[unprotected sex? Not cool. I'm a gynecologist, and I pay attention to these things, and neither Taylor nor Jonah seem to be at the point in their lives when they seem ready to have a kid - which can happen. STDs are also not cool, you know? Chlamydia is not a joke! I wish Melina Marchetta included a condom-buying scene. It may dampen the mood, but would have provided protection and a nod of approval from this Ob/Gyn doc. (hide spoiler)]And yet, despite my adulthood, despite a few eye-rolls, despite the issues that I describe above, I STILL teared up at the end. I think admitting that will TOTALLY ruin my street cred, but oh well. All the above taken into consideration, 4 easy stars.

It's that constant air of enigma and enchantment, that underlying presence of hope mixed with tragedy that draws you in so very thoroughly; all presented without the need for tasteless dramatics, maudlin behavior or overattention to romance.When you can manage making my heart feel so passionately for a person who only exists in whisps of memories throughout the entire course of a novel, I salute you.

Going into this, I did not know that these characters and their stories would stick with me for days, weeks, after. Immediately after finishing this book, I felt like starting it all over again. I think Jellicoe Road is best read if you jump into it blindly. So I'll try not to give too much away in this review. 
“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.”
Since the age of eleven Taylor Markham has been at boarding school. At seventeen she is now the chosen leader of her school's underground activities and is in charge of how they proceed in the annual territory wars against the townies and visiting cadets. Taylor's past is filled with abandonment, grief and pain. When her caretaker at school, Hannah, the only adult she trusts, leaves unexpectedly Taylor has a need to know where Hannah could be and in doing so also finds out other unexpected truths.I know many people did not enjoy this book because of the writing style and the confusion of the first half. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But for me, it was perfection. Yes it was confusing but I love figuring things out. We got passages set in the past, which didn't follow a proper time line. The mystery of not knowing what was going on or how things connected added to my enjoyment. I needed to know how everything fit.“As I walk back to the school on my own, I realise I'm crying. So I go back to the stories I've read about the five and I try to make sense of their lives because in making sense of theirs, I may understand mine.”I really loved the setting. I have never read a book set in Australia before and it was super interesting to read about. This was set around Christmas time which is the summer holidays in Australia. I could totally relate to that as I too live in the southern hemisphere. I am surprised by how quickly I became attached to the characters. Those in the past and present. I wanted them to be happy, to confront their fears and to be together. “Because people with that much spirit frighten the hell out of me. They make me want to be a better person when I know it's not possible.”The side characters were so well fleshed out. And I was just as invested in their stories as I was in Taylor's. Their character growth and development and their own struggles was so beautiful to read. Watching them become more to one another brought me such joy. “But grief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for.”This is a book that I will reread again and again and know that eveytime it will still impact me as it did the first time I read it. I think what also added to my experience was that I read this with a group of besties. We'd text eachother our thoughts and laugh about how much this book was making us cry. I had the best time reading this. A thousand thanks to Fares for suggesting we read one of his favourite books.

This book. -----Note: I’m not sure where the words ‘On the’ went… I’m assuming it’s different for the British version and not that I have a defective copy.Also… while I’m Note-ing: This review will be a lot shorter than other reviews because this book is best read knowing nothing about it. Initial Final Page Thoughts.Breathtaking. I need to listen to the masses more. High Points.JONAH GRIGGS. Sorry, had to get that out there. Taylor Markham= New Soul Sister. Australia. Mystery! Nostalgia. Childhood games. Raff. Beautiful writing. Amazing character development. Heartbreakingly perfect ending. Low Points.When I read books (real books, not Kindle ones because they have the nifty ‘Add Notes/Highlights’ button) I have a pink polka dot notebook that I jot down page numbers, thoughts and quotes in. I know that’s not a radical thing to do because I know a lot of people who do similar things, and as I read this novel I found myself writing down questions that I believed would be answered at the end. Most of them were and everything made sense, but there were two questions that I had that I really wanted to know the answers to. The answers wouldn't really add anything to the story... I'm just nosey.Not that I’m hankering after a sequel because this book was perfect on its own and I think a sequel would be pointless, but I feel like I need to sit Ms Marchetta down and ask her my questions just for some closure. So, if you’re ever in Manchester MM, there’s a caffeinated drink on me!Heroine.I loved loved loved Taylor Markham and from the first page I knew that she was going to be a part of the League of Soul Sisters (along with Vera, Katniss (don’t mention Mockingjay), Viola and The Rat) that I am considering setting up.I’m going to be the ‘funny one’ in this group, obviously, because I lack the coolness, wit, feistiness and the ability to throw a ball in a straight line never mind shoot an arrow. Taylor was the perfect mix of disgruntled moody teenager, spunky heroine and confused young girl. Yes, she can teeter on the edge of being a bitch but I think that’s what I liked about her. She’s flawed and she’s normal and she’s trying to deal with so much I practically encouraged her to be a bit prickly. YA fiction is so full of impossibly perfect heroines that make it so hard to relate to. But I really related to Taylor and her outlook on life and in the time it took me to read this book, I found myself really caring about what happened to her. And I think that’s why a lot of people really love this book. So yeah, Taylor, keep your eye out for the postman because there's an official invitation in the post for you...Love Interest.Oh Jonah. When I heard you described by many a girl as the mysterious loner with a dark and tortured past, I have to admit that alarm bells were going off.There’s something about the word ‘mysterious’ and 'loner' when used to describing boys that triggers an alarming adverse reaction in me (lots of frowning, yawning, skipping of pages, eye-rolling, eye-clawing-out etc).But you, Jonah Griggs, you are my kind of guy and you are allowed your dark and tortured past. I don’t want to say a lot on this subject because if you haven’t read it already then you need to experience JG first hand. But this guy brings the swoon and I have to agree with Taylor on one thing (well, on most things, but this one in particular)… I prefer him in his fatigues. BOOM.Also an honourable mention has to go to Santangelo, with his abs (don’t worry Taylor, I wouldn’t look away either) and Ben, my violinist and his medieval jousting. Hot damn. Theme Tune.Local Boy in the Photograph - Stereophonics. I immediately thought of this song... not just the subject matter but the whole message of the lyrics. Bitter sweet. Angst Scale.9/10. I really don’t want to say anything in this department for fear of spoiling things. But my favourite part of this book was the way past events were interwoven with the present day and how they affected the characters. I found these passages that were filled with innocence, hope, lost youth, impossible situations and, most importantly, the power of best friends so beautiful and captivating. Recommended For.EVERYONE. People who love mystery books. People who are comfortable with having butterflies in their stomach permanent because when JG brings the swoon… sorry, I’ll stop. People who like kick-ass, resourceful and perfectly complex heroines. People who love beautifully written and fantastically paced prose. People who wish they were younger again so they could have adventures in the best tree house in the world… complete with espresso.",99,default,[]

“From this distance everything is so bloody perfect.”
This will not be a proper review, because On the Jellicoe Road turned me into ruins. Quite possibly, my favorite book of the year, because it is so unique and so gut-wrenching and so enrapturing it deserves the title. This book is not merely a reading experience; this book is a journey. One filled with two emotional plotlines, past and present, that overlap in places only to thread themselves together in a masterful and sad, yet agonizingly beautiful story. 

This book is about finding yourself. About hating the world and cursing the universe for forcing you to exist when you're left abandoned by everyone else. About your whole life being a question mark. And about finally opening up to the world and embracing it to the fullest. 
“Hold my hand because I might disappear.”
This book is about love, every kind of love. The one between siblings. The one that's so intense it's everything to you and leaves you dying when that love suddenly stops. The one that's as natural as breathing. The one that you try to bury beneath excuses. And about the love for life, for living, despite it continuously trying to shove you down. 
“It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
This book is about the ugliness of humanity. About serial killers. About drug addiction. About neglected children. About pedophilia and child pornography. About goddamn cancer. About abuse. About suicide. About car accidents. About being parentless. About loss and about death. 
“Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?”
But, I believe, most importantly, this book is about friendships. I cannot find the words to describe how amazing the friendships portrayed in this novel are. They just filled me up with immense joy and plastered smiles on my face and gave me a sense of family. With their banter, their bromance, their love for mischief, their leadership, their honesty, their support for one another and their endless, boundless, eternal love. 

Also, this book is about clever and magical storytelling. About how an author can enthrall you with some words on a page and make you cry like you lost someone dear to you. About how she can twist your heart and make you curse out loud for (fictional) live being so unfair. About how she can give you goosebumps and butterflies in your stomach and sighs and accelerated heartbeats. And this book is about me and how I have fallen in love with its every single character. I love Taylor. I love Jonah. I love Santangelo. I love Raffy. I love Ben. I love Jessa. I love Trini. I even love Chloe P. and Richard and Sam. And I adore Webb and Narnie and Tate and Fitz and Jude. They were the backbone of this book, its essence, its soul. And oh, Fitz, I just want to hug the poor precious boy. And oh, Narnie, I just want to destroy her numbness.And oh, Tate, I just want to hold her hand and be there for her.And oh, Jude, I just want to save him from the heartache. And oh, Webb, I just want to place him in the sky between the stars where he belongs because he is perfection. After I finished reading at 5AM, I kept asking myself: Why haven't I read this sooner? How much can a single person cry in one night? How much can you love a book? What to do with my life now? And so here I am, begging you to read this book if you haven't done so yet. Let it be a journey for you.

Completely, totally fucked up. Everybody in it is fucked up, and living their lives is fucked up, and by the time you're done with it, you're fucked up, but you can't tell because your head is cloudy from all the tears you've shed getting through this fucked-up book. I hate On The Jellicoe Road. I hate books that make me cry, and this book made me want to weep tears of blood for all that lost youth and promise, and the pain of loss and the promise of the future. If somebody had told me how mixed-up and emotional this book was going to make me feel, I would have abandoned it in a corner and floated off to the simple uncomplicated world of supernatural ass-kicking, where nobody dies and even if they do, they rarely stay dead. In the big debate of Saving Francesca versus Jellicoe Road, I would have to pick Jellicoe Road. I liked Francesca better, but that's because it made me laugh and think and smile mistily, but it never, ever, shoved me into the wringer and brought me out feeling like a limp dishcloth. It never made me feel that piercing tender pain you get when you think of things long past that can never be regained. It never made me feel like I was drowning in the lives of people who are so real, it's hard to believe they don't exist and haven't consumed your life. Jellicoe Road is a harsher, deeper read, the sandpaper to Francesca's paint peeler. Undeniably, the writing is brilliant. It's evocative and tender, it makes the emotions in each page almost tangible. The characters are drawn brilliantly too, and despite the fact that over half of the main cast wants to kill themselves at one point or the other, you cannot help but be drawn to them. I loved Taylor and Griggs and Santangelo and Raffy, but my heart got well and truly tangled up with Narnie and Webb and Judd and Tate and Fitz. It's for them that my heart broke, and shattered into a million pieces. The story is told largely from the perspective of Taylor, but it is the ghosts that predominate, that breathe life into the story, ironic as that sounds. This is not a book for people who want a straightforward love story with a dash of drama. This is for people who want to appreciate good writing, and don't mind losing a little bit of themselves between the covers of a book in the process. Oh man, this book is just so seriously Fucked.

I cried way too much, but it was so worth it. Will review tomorrow when I can wrap my head around what to write.*moves ahead a day in time*After sleeping on it, I'm still struggling with how to write a proper review. There are some books which are virtually impossible to explain, and this is one of them. The GR book summary gives no indication what the book is really about, and truth be told, I'm not sure you'd want to know what the book is about before reading it.The first 150 pages or so are completely frustrating and confusing. I knew this ahead of time, but I also knew that just about every single person who has read this has said the exact same thing, yet still gave the book 5 stars. There is a reason for this. The first part of the book is only giving you glimpses of the player's lives and their world. It almost reminded me of one of those movies that you watch in reverse, where the ending is the beginning and the beginning is the end - yet not quite. All I can do is echo the voices of those who prodded me to read the book - DON'T GIVE UP. You will not forget this book. You will not regret reading. It is so worth the read. Keep some tissues handy.As the story unfolds, the author starts giving us a crumb of information, then another, then another. Slowly the pieces of a broken story come together as one revelation follows another in a wave - a very emotional wave at that. Just when you think you've heard it all, more starts to come. Then more, then more. Pay attention to every single character. Just about every person's life is intertwined with the other characters in this story.I'm done trying to prod you to read this. Just read it. You will not be sorry for making the effort. Please, I beg you...battle through the first part of the book (which is confusing) until you get to the part that starts to get into your soul. Let's call this a dare.

I bow to you, Melina Marchetta! When I grow up, I want to be you! (Ok, I might have lost that chance, maybe in a new life then, lol)__________________Full (former) review:It took me 113 days to write a full review.. I counted.

Reading one of Marchetta’s stories should be one of the “10 things to do in your lifetime”. Seriously, this woman is one of the most creative people alive, one of the most amazing writers I came across and I wish I could put into words the awesomeness of this book, but I feel at a loss for words once more.In fact, I should invent a new language with a dictionary full of ways to praise her talent.Because Melina Marchetta doesn’t only write books, she creates entire worlds full of fleshed-out characters and shattering emotions, and after you read about them you feel like you’re the luckiest person in the known Universe and beyond. Because not many people in this world are able to feel what she makes you feel, and not many authors get to create such strong connections between the characters and the reader.I feel like her stories have a soul. Like her characters are living beings trappend into a fantasy world, waiting for us to come and listen to their stories. They seem to breathe through our emotions, and I don’t remember a moment when I didn’t feel something (deep) towards this story and these wonderful characters.Her words sing to me, they reach into the deep core of my own soul, they make me laugh through tears, they break my heart into thousand pieces but they also put it back in together, making it beat in a whole new rhythm, making it love and ache on a different level.Once again, the complexity of the plot left me lightheaded, in awe, even though I knew what was coming my way. It’s been a while since the last time I read this book and I felt it all all over again: the confusion, the despair, the hope, the heartbreak, the happiness. My teary eyes could barely read and I was left breathless too many times to count. I loved EVERYTHING about this book, after all this time it is still my favorite story and I really hope that when (and if) you read this book you will be able to feel just a tiny-tiny part off all these blissful emotions flowing through my heart right now.

THE STORY:How much heartbreak can a heart take?Jellicoe road is a roller coaster, a story meant to break hearts – one about true friendship and love, about forgiveness and salvation, about hope and disappointment, about life and death and everything in between.It simply left me in awe again because there is no tiny detail, there is nothing less important in this story. Everything has value, all words have power – to make you laugh or cry, to dream and hope.. and the real beauty of it is connecting all the threads in this fabulous piece of art.But as heartbreaking and intense as it might be, it is also fun, and I found myself smiling more than once. So don’t go thinking that this is a depressing book, it is not; it has the perfect balance between joy and sadness, between delight and heartbreak – but don’t believe me, see it for yourself!THE CHARACTERS:I can’t put into words how much compassion I felt towards the characters in this story. I don’t think there’s one that didn’t leave an impression on me. Some times they made me laugh (even through tears), some other I just wanted to hold them close to my heart and protect them from all the hurt in their lives.

CONCLUSION:Every time I read “On the Jellicoe Road” it simply takes my breath away.I fall in love with this book all over again, it hits me full strength no matter how well I think I know the story, it makes me smile and cry and sometimes both in the same time, all while I get drunk on the beauty of Marchetta’s words. Pure talent, pure Aussie awesomeness!

1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1390613767,1390613767,2015-09-13,5,Nicole,/user/show/40997852-nicole,"The Reader’s Guide to the Jellicoe Road is a wholly unremarkable review. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many days and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from a countless numbers of experienced readers and researchers. The introduction begins like this: “On the Jellicoe road,” it says, “is good. Really good. You just won’t believe how phenomenally amazingly mind-bogglingly good it is. I mean, you may think it’s confusing up the road, but that’s just normal. Listen…” and so on. (After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that it'll make you cry, laugh, lose hope, love, grieve, hope again, smile, shake, and all kinds of emotions but hate. There's nothing to hate there. Moreover, it gives directions to the best way to read this book and gives some very illogical arguments.) The guide provides the best way to read on the Jellicoe road, it goes something like this:1. know a bit but not much background2. use your brain3. bring a box of tissues It goes even further and explains each point. ➀Taylor’s life and the italic paragraphs intertwine together to deliver a beautiful story. Our MC is not perfect. In fact, there isn't any perfect character in this book but you’ll love all of them. No exceptions.The guide goes a bit off topic so we had to cut the rest of the paragraphs and get back to the actual summary.[…]Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school. Hannah, who works there, found her alone (left in a restaurant) and took her in when she was 11. However, when Hannah disappears leaving Taylor more lost than ever and our MC is selected to lead the territory war against the Townies (people from the town) and the Cadets (military students) her whole life is about to change. It doesn’t end there, the leader of the Cadets is none other than Jonah Griggs with whom she shared an unforgettable history. Her obsession about finding her mother only complicates matters. All of this will change not only her perspective of her life forever but her future as well. ➁ Have fun reading this book, literally. Try to come up with your own theories because believe me when I say I, every word Marchetta writes has a purpose. It’s also not impossible to make correct predications because I did. Make assumptions, link everything, analyze, think, whatever you want. Just don’t sit there waiting for the author to tell you what’s happening. If you don’t, you probably won’t like the book. Things start to make a bit more sense after page 100 and everything will be clear only by the end of the book. So you’ll have a hard time reading On the Jellicoe Road if you try to be only a passive reader. ➂ Happy moments, sad moments, nothing moments, my tears kept running. It was just so emotional and beautiful not in a forced way. Sometimes you feel like the author is telling you: it’s time to cry!! Not here. This book made me want to lay down, curl in ball, and just cry forever. Sure, there are tragedies here but it’s not just that. While the amazing writing style definitely helps, you’ll just feel like you’re a part of the story and not just an outsider who is reading a book. You’ll share the characters joy, sadness, hardships, adventures, friendships, love, and hope, just everything. (Expert from The Reader’s guide to the Jellicoe Roadpage 49372, Section 3b. Entry: the characters.)The best thing about this book is the characters. I mean yes everything about this book is the best thing but these are special. They are so memorable and real that you’ll love each and every one of them. It’s really hard to pick a favorite because you’ll find yourself relating to each person one way or another. You’ll wait with Jude to meet his best friends (who will become yours too but just one sided :p) each September, you’ll share Taylor’s difficulties trying to manage her house, you’ll enjoy the time she spends with her new not so friends, you’ll try so hard to discover the reason behind Hannah’s disappearance, you’ll fall in love with Jonah and Santangelo… You’ll just feel like you’re part of the story and the characters who are flawed and very realistic will make you want to read about their adventures forever. 
A Final Note from the Author:
Read this book. It was hard to review it because I find it hard to review the books I loved. I really think this book should be more popular. Best YA contemporary I've ever read. Melina Marchetta is a genius. On the Jellicoe Road is what I call a 
Contemporary Young-Adult Masterpiece.

I felt like that until I actually went to Walden Pond. Imagine my surprise when some friends and I decided to go for a hike, go for a swim and check out the scenery--we left Boston around 9...and we got there by 9:30. Yeah right, HDT, I could live deliberately in the woods, too, if I knew my transcendentalist cronies would bring me a Cinnabon and some pumpkin ale once in awhile.** Nevertheless, Thoreau’s idea served as the inspiration for Yeats’ poem Lake Isle of Innisfree*** from which Melina Marchetta quotes in this novel. Yeats, who looks a little like Kenneth from 30 Rock, wrote about Innisfree because, to him, it served as an idyllic place where he could always go for peace and solitude. (I find it rather amusing that both Thoreau and Yeats wrote fascinating works about livin’ la vida simple that become so popular. Lesson: If you find a perfect place, KEEP IT TO YOURSELF)But Marchetta's magnificent storytelling was only enhanced by her reference to Yeats' poem. Instead of pounding quotations into your head, like a sad number of authors do, Marchetta only mentioned Innisfree once in passing...but it stuck with me through the rest of the book.I don’t want to go into the plot of this book too deeply, for the point I took away from the book is that we all have those idyllic places we go to in our minds. For some of the characters in this novel, their Innisfree was with family, or with their childhood friends, or even just spending time with one particular person. It doesn't have to be a place at all. No matter how far we get away from those memories, they are always all polished up in our minds like the Hope Diamond when we need to imagine a perfect place in time.Marchetta’s characters, as usual, were intriguing and fleshed out. It is constantly amazing to me that I can read a book and be unable to visualize even the protagonist, while this author is able to give me an extensive cast of characters and I feel like each one of them is someone I know. From Santangelo to Griggs to Raffy to the Brigadier, I understood where they were coming from and could reasonable predict what they would do in a situation. Very rarely was I frustrated with choices that characters made. (view spoiler)[Though I wish Hannah and Jude got together earlier and that they had raised Taylor as mother and father. To deprive her of a childhood that could’ve been better than it was out of loyalty to Tate was, though perhaps understandable, still frustrating. Same for Jessa. (hide spoiler)] I also have no idea how Marchetta can make my heart hurt one moment and make me hysterically laugh the next.I must admit that the territory war aspect of the novel was not my favorite, though I understand its place in the overall story. (view spoiler)[When it all comes to a close, I wonder if next year’s students, Townies, and cadets will see fit to just share the area? (hide spoiler)] The transfer back and forth between Taylor's present day and Hannah's story was rough for the first fourth or so of the book. If you try it and get stuck, please truck through it--it is so worth it.As I knock each of Melina Marchetta’s book off my to-be-read stack, I am a little more sad. When I’m done with them, how long will I have to wait for a new one?*The Wikipedia entry for HDT informs me that he wore a “neckbeard” for many years and insisted many women found it attractive. 1) I never knew that hideousness had a name; and 2) If you are a woman that finds a neckbeard attractive and we are friends on here, just go ahead and defriend me.**He was only 1.5 miles from his homeboy Emerson’s house.***This poem is the shit.EDIT: I listened to the first third or so of this book and read the rest in book form. The audiobook was great but I wanted to read it faster. The only negative for the audiobook was the annoying DMB-type music that played between every chapter and at the beginning and end of every disc.",68,default,"['aussie-ya-is-the-cats-meow', 'young-adult-teen', 'kcls', 'favorites', 'so-good-i-stayed-up-to-read-it', 'read-in-2011', 'reviewed-2011']"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestPeople swear by this book; they want to make it their god. Well, if this book is a religion, then I'm an atheist, because there was absolutely nothing in this book I want to believe in. Did we all read the same book? Man, the author is lucky that books don't have hotlines where you can phone in to complain about your lack of customer satisfaction, because I'd be on the line right now, saying, ""Dafuque-ce que c'est?"" Comme ça.JELLICOE ROAD is an utterly nonsensical book that appears to thrive on its own pretension. Taylor, the main character, spends all of her time either whining or crying, and her biggest claim to fame is that she's in charge of this stupid mock-war her school fights with the locals and the local military school for ""territory."" If that sounds confusing, don't worry - it's never explained, it doesn't make sense, and it's just as childish and lame as it sounds. Oh, and she's in love with the local bad boy military student who ~betrayed~ her once, many a summer ago.Looped in with this Risk LARPing is the story of some other pretentious kids with ~issues~ who are connected with Taylor's story in a mysterious way. This other POV was incredibly boring and I skimmed it, and yes, the payoff was just as disappointing as I'd imagined it would be, and surprise, surprise, I was able to predict most of it. I'm guessing this is the part of the story that made people shed tears, but mostly I just thought it was lame. And pretentious.I guess if you want to read about the most boring LARP session ever with a tepid love story that makes TWILIGHT seem deep and profound by comparison, read this book. If you're looking for the profound and live-changing story that was beautifully written and so moving and unique, take me with you, because I finished this book and I didn't find that story.

It’s the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he’s saying, ‘Here I am world, are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?’”Sometimes, guys, simply reading a book once is not enough. You find that reading it a second time offers you a whole other reading experience. Those once slow 100 pages now whiz you by, and you realise it was not the pace that was at fault, but your confusion.You savour it so much more. Make sense of certain references - crush on the plot, characters and writing, and fall in love with Jonah Griggs all over again.It frustrates me so much to know that I can never do this book justice. That so many readers out there have yet to read this beauty. The thing is, somehow, even though I knew what was going to happen, I choked up and laughed like a mad women at the exact same scenes I did the first time around. What made me smile at times was how the little tissues were still there. So many times I would be about to bookmark a certain moment only to realise that it was already bookmarked. I suppose I know myself too well ;)When I approached the last 100 pages I decided to read them outside in the garden. I have never had that urge before, but It was dark outside, silent and soothing in a way that I couldn't imagine it being inside. It felt right to read those last pages alone - in a peaceful surrounding. Yet, like last time, I dreaded that last page, and when it had ended - I closed the book and just allowed my thoughts to take over and savour them, because I knew it would be a long time before any other book would ever make me feel like this again. I took that moment to mourn characters and a world I genuinely felt I had lost - taking some solace in the fact that I would return to them when the feeling of loss became close to unbearable.You know, I can see myself reading this every year, discovering something new every time, loving the characters even more - if that's even possible.Once again I was left with this undeniable ache that made me want to be a part of these characters lives, but I think what bothered me the most, and what really made me feel somewhat of a loss, was knowing that I will never know a Tate, Hannah, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Jonah, Ben, Raffy, Chaz, Jessa, and Taylor. I feel like I'm saying goodbye to something personal every time I turn over that last page, but now I know that's hardly the case.

It's a Cybil's Finalist and a ALA Printz Award Winner. So people LOVE Jellicoe Road and I usually follow popular librarian opinion, but I just can't get on this bandwagon.I felt like the writing was very, very confusing. For the first 100 pages I really couldn't tell what was going on. Don't get me wrong - dramatic and interesting things were happening, but I couldn't even begin to see how they were related. The character development is very spread out and most of the characters do not become clear until the end.There are two plot lines -1 - Taylor's life at Jellicoe School - The school has tradition of playing war games with the local townies and the cadets of a military school. They fight over territories, trails, and clubhouses. They take it very seriously, but it’s mostly in good fun. Taylor is the student leader of the Jellicoe School (like head girl - very big responsibility), but the school is made up of 6 houses and all of the houses have leaders too and they must collaborate to wage war against the townies and cadets.2 - Taylor's life before Jellicoe School – Taylor’s father has been killed and her mother is an abandoning drug addict. Taylor has no family to speak of but is taken care of by a local woman named Hannah. Hannah is writing a book about the goings on of Jellicoe School when she attended and Taylor is using the book to piece together her own random memories to understand what her life was actually about – mainly the story of her mother and father.In my opinion, these two plot lines do not mix. I didn’t know when to take Taylor seriously or when she was in deep emotional distress. One moment Taylor’s reclaiming territory for the Jellicoe School and the next moment she’s drowning a cat with her bare hands.There are very moving parts to this story. I felt for Taylor, Hannah, Griggs, & Jude, but everyone beyond that didn’t touch me. They were just part of the confusion.Will someone please, please tell me what they LOVE about this book and what makes it a multiple award winner? Is something wrong with my logic?

I started reading this book last week, but I was in a horrible slump, and apparently this book is not the best book to read during one. So, I stopped reading it for a few days while I fixed my slump. It was basically over beginning of this week and then I picked JelliNOE again two days ago. DID THINGS GET BETTER? NOPE.JelliNOOOOOOOOOE.Guys, please, someone tell me what was happening in this book.

He reads this book!Seriously, I am one of the moderators of The Filipino Group here in Goodreads. This book, Jellicoe Road by an Australian novelist, Melina Marchetta is our book of the month and we will have our face-to-face book discussion on Saturday. As a moderator and one of the senior members of the group, some members ask me what I think of the book. Even if they don't say or admit it, my views influence some of them. At this point, I guess my job is to encourage them to read the book and join the actual book discussion. That's why even if I did not like this book, I cannot rate this with 1 star. Why I did not like this book?1. I cannot understand why the first 100 pages should be made confusing2. The claim or fight for territory has nothing to do with the rest of the book. Also, I do not understand exactly how it is supposed to work.3. The love affair between Taylor and Briggs is too mushy for my taste. Felt like Katniss-Peeta or Bella-Edward. I'm too old for that.4. Taylor is a pathetic female character IMO.5. Taylor is asked to lead even if she is asthmatic. Is there nobody else who can lead?Anyway, according to my trusted friends in this group, the book is amazing. Maybe they are still young and the story ""speaks"" to them. So, let's leave it at that. However, I can say that this book has a good intent. It also has a developed story that other readers can emphatize with. I guess that this is just not for me. But it is my ardent desire that this book will influence our North Korean friend to back off in his evil plan of building nuclear arsenal in the side of the world. Stop your expansionist plan, please and be content on what you have. Then if you have to test nukes, please don't point it to the Philippines! See, we also love Melina Marchetta!

And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall. It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that's objectively wrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:""What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids? Whaaaat?"" But this setting does begin to feel much more appropriate once you get a bit further in.God, everyone in this novel was so intense.Once I started realizing what was going on, who was who, and why certain things were relevant... Damn. My heart was beating so fast while making these discoveries, and they are all individually and magnificently devastating.This is a book that slowly sinks its claws into you, and before you know it you're caught. And once you're caught, there's no getting out until the end.The end broke my heart into so many pieces. I'm still picking them up. Such a wonderfully genuine and heartfelt story, with characters that come walking right out of the pages to meet you.

I had been DYING for it's release ~ and can still remember how tingly and giddy I felt as I walked home with my copy. Back then, I had 3 kids under 5 and couldn't wait for them to get in bed so I could curl up and savour my new Melina Marchetta.On The Jellicoe Road is notorious for people finding the beginning confusing ~ and I have seen lovers of the book urge people to persevere to find it's magic. It was not like that for me. From the first chapter ~ I was spellbound. I remember thinking it was beautiful and haunting and funny and so entirely utterly appealing ~ the prose and the mystery and the characters. I guess I did feel a little like: what is going on? But not in a distracting way. It was absorbing and engaging and mesmerising. And entirely unexpected.I LOVED how gorgeously chaotic the story initially felt. I knew NOTHING about it ~ I even wondered if Santangelo would be the love interest in the early days (which quickly flew from my mind as Jonah's (JONAH!) story started unravelling).I LOVE that I knew nothing about it. Not one review, not one opinion. I had my expectations of awesomeness (it was, after all, a Melina Marchetta and I had read (and re-read) her previous two books countless times. Reading it blindly was a stunning experience: I felt like the whole world was just me and the book. That the entire experience was mine. That no one had gone before me. That the story was for me and I was a part of the story. I still feel like that, in a way. I see others discovering it and loving it and I am SO proud of it (as if, somehow, it is mine, haha) ~ but a small part of me feels like it belongs uniquely to me. More to me than anyone else (I know this is a ridiculous sentiment, but I still feel it). I almost feel private about it ~ as if it has become a part of me and talking about is like letting others peek into my soul.That very first time: I read it all in one go. I was shattered and absorbed and breathless and incredulous. I fell in love with the characters and the prose and the setting. I still recall finishing the book and how I felt gutted and euphoric and in awe all at once. Too stunned to cry (even though it would have been lovely to weep), I lay in my bed for an hour, just thinking about it. And then ... I picked it up and started reading it from the beginning all over again. Since then, I have read it every year (sometimes more than once). It has never lost it's magic. It weaves itself deeper into me. It is my own personal cult book <3It seems ridiculous that I have not reviewed my favourite book of all time. I think I just feel entirely too inadequate to be up the the task. I also feel like it is such a part of me that I want to hold it close and not share it with the world. Yet another part of me feels like I could talk about it all day long and never tire of things to say and quotes to quote. This isn't a review, per se. It is me, humbly telling you, that 'On The Jellicoe Road' is my favourite book of all time. It is brilliant and hopeful and ache-y and truly soul-changing. It is the kind of chaotically gorgeous masterpiece that you only ever-so-rarely stumble across. It is perfect in it's brilliance. It radiates life and hope even as it is filled with grief and sorrow.

I’m glad I didn’t because if I had, I wouldn’t have known of a wonderful though devastatingly painful but inspiring story of love, grief and friendship of two different generations but whose lives are intricately connected to one another.  The mystery behind the characters is also one great reason that kept me reading on, wanting to find out the connections among the characters.  The story also relates the different ways by which people process grief through the different characters and by reading the story, it was as if I was grieving with each character. Good thing, like any other process, grief too has an end or at least a point in which the person must move on and the story thankfully ends with the inspiring message of moving on and living and appreciating life the way those whom you’ve lost would want you to.

 ▒ This book. This fucking BOOK. ▒Why is it so special to me? You mean, except from the fact it's written by Marchetta and contains Jonah Griggs in it? Apart from that? Well, what you need to know is that few authors manage to change my perception of myself as a reader. Yet if there's something I learnt this year, that's Melina Marchetta's books are written in a way that makes me want to create a stamp which would say - That says it all. The reason I rarely cry when I read is the fact I hate feeling manipulated. I loathe it when I can see through the author's intentions and I'm pretty sure that's why I never succeeded in finishing The fault in our stars. Melina Marchetta's books show me something I was eager to learn, because even if I knew it deep down inside, I was seeking out the moment I'd unravel all my doubts : No, I'm not a cold-hearted reader. I was just longing for stories which really speak to me, because, never, ever again I want to find myself thinking 'oh, I think I'm supposed to cry right now'. The beauty of her books lies in the surprise they never fail to create in me : I could express it with a single word : suddenly.And that emergence of unexpected feelings? I live for that shit. ▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒Jellicoe road takes us into the life of characters so strongly convinced of the uselessness of their life that we want to fight for them. We want to tear the appearances out, and above all that, we're grateful to Melina Marchetta because her characters are so relatable and real that we can find pieces of ourselves in them. Pieces of our friends. Pieces of our family. Pieces of my heart that broke for Jonah Griggs over and over again. 
""Please don’t be crazy, Taylor,” Griggs whispers, leaning his head against mine. “Please don’t be crazy.” He kisses me, holding my face between his hands, whispering over and over again, “Please"".
 Therefore don't worry if you're confused throughout the 100 first pages, I swear to you, there must surely come a stage when you'll find yourself utterly captivated by Taylor's journey. Moreover, after reading it a second time, I can assure you that this experience was even more emotional and that Marchetta wrapped her plot brilliantly - I noticed some things I couldn't see the first time and WOW. Just WOW. This structure? Incredible. Everything has a sense. Everything has a purpose. Nothing's useless. Nothing. ▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒This is a tale about where we belong. Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it love? Can we stop belonging somewhere? Can we earn the right to belong or is it something we have in our heart no matter what we do? Can we allow somebody else to be our everything? Because what happens, I'm asking I'm yelling, what happens if our everything disappears? *whisper* Do we disappear as well?Now, I don't want to scare you how that's too late? and I can assure you that Jellicoe Road isn't the kind of book that makes your eyes ache all long without never releasing the tension. No. That's just life, you know? So prepare yourself for a ride - you're going to laugh, to be pissed, to be desperate at times, to lose hope and then fight to find it again - You're going to live and feel and smile. 
""Go on, admit it. When he hits the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?""
▒  But this book. This fucking BOOK. ▒I don't want to talk about the plot. Damn, I just can't and I'll say only one thing : even if I guessed some parts of the mystery pretty fast, following Taylor and Jonah was an experience I'd have been sad to miss and that captivating and splendorous story will linger in my heart and in my thoughts for a very long time.
You know what you have to do.
 
""I reach the bottom and smash into him with my fists as hard as I can. He falls and I can't believe he goes down that easy, caught off balance.""You care about nothing, you piece of shit!""I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.""Never,"" he tells me in a tone full of ice, ""under-estimate who or what I care for.”
PS : I have a million quotes to write, a million stories about Jonah, Webbs, Tate, Narny, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, Jessa to tell. But I won't. I won't because this is a book which must be savored blind. I won't even if Jonah Griggs is certainly one of the characters I will never forget. Just meet them, and if that's already the case, go reread it. That's even better the second time around, trust me.

The only thing that was blown is my patience.

But for whatever reason you can’t look away, or change the channel, and now an hour has gone by and you’re totally immersed and haven’t moved an inch and you’re like HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD I CANNOT MOVE UNTIL IT’S DONE WHY HAVEN’T I WATCHED THIS SOONER.Yea, that was this book for me.I started it, was lost for like the first 30%, but then when 50% came around, I COULDN’T. FREAKING. STOP. The beginning was a little confusing because the author just kind of throws you into the story with zero background or knowledge of what’s going on. But as the story goes on, little hints and clues and these crazy coincidences start to appear and the whole time you’re like holy shit didn’t this happen before? Wait, is she that girl? OMG IT IS! What does this mean??!?I’m going to try to explain what this story is all about without spoiling anything so if you do happen to pick this up (AND YOU TOTALLY SHOULD) you’ll have a little background.The heroine Taylor – who I would like to point out was such a great complex character - was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road when she was 11. She doesn’t know why but is brought to the Jellicoe School. And at this school, the kids are spread among ‘houses’ (think of a type of sorority/fraternity). Taylor is elected to be the leader of her house and to lead the school’s annual territory wars versus the Townies (the kids who go to I guess what would be equivalent to public school) and the Cadets (kids from a type of military school). And among the wars and fights and negotiations for things like access to biking trails and club houses, etc., Taylor is trying to figure out why her house mother has gone missing, why she dreams of the same boy every night and if he is trying to tell her something, why her mother abandoned her all those years ago, and how it’s all connected.Insert Jonah Griggs. The leader of the Cadets, and the boy who stole the show and my heart. He is without a FREAKING DOUBT what made this story for me. He and Taylor have a history (even though they are supposed to hate each other while the ‘wars’ are going on.) His backstory was absolutely heartbreaking. The romance in this was very subtle but his moments with Taylor were so powerful and romantic and beautiful and had me wanting to cry like a child. All he wants is to help her heal and figure out the mystery of her past.
""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”__“What are you thinking? “I whisper after a while.“That you deserve romance,” he says.
 And this whole book is so much more than the mystery. It’s about love and family and friendship and acceptance and fate and okay I need to stop before I start crying because I really fell in love with this whole thing. I didn’t expect to love this book so much, and just want to SHOUT about how much I did. I love picking up books not knowing where the hell it is all going and just being blown away in the end. And that’s exactly what happened.http://amzn.to/1M7EULA

“It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
Here's the secret recipe to open my floodgates. Treat with care.Hand me a contemporary written by Marchetta, and I'll turn into a tsunami of tears.This review is not going to be as extensive as my usual ones, but please be so kind to check out my co-blogger Chantal's lovely review on our blog 
Every Word A Doorway
.I've avoided On the Jellicoe Road for years tbh. Probably because I had loved Saving Francesca so much in my youth and was scared that no other Marchetta book would ever compare. Finnikin of the Rock certainly couldn't, and I strongly believe Marchetta was born to be a realistic fiction writer, not a creator of fantasy worlds. So then I was at my local book store last winter and Chantal all but forced me to buy this. My history of avoiding this book continued, however, as it sat lonely and misplaced on my shelf. Last week, I finally decided to pick it up. Which brings us to the sobfest that is my broken self after reading this book. 
Saving Francesca
 is still closer to my heart, mainly due to its topics, but On the Jellicoe Road felt quite similar in style with its troubled main character, witty side protagonists, brooding love interest, school setting, and the serious issues it tackles. I adored the characters, especially the main character, as much as I enjoyed the dark humour from the first person POV from which the story was told. Compared to Saving Francesca, this book has a touch of mystery, as snippets of a manuscript appear between chapters, slowly unravelling along with the main character's personal storyline. Marchetta also never sugarcoats a first and/or young love which I value in a genre full of unicorns and rainbows. The only reason I cannot give this 5 stars is because the beginning is too abrupt a start. The first chapter was both confusing and unnerving, making me wonder whether I wanted to continue, and it took me quite some time go become invested in the story thereafter. A smoother introduction would've been required. Besides shattering my heart and then glueing the pieces together again, On the Jellicoe Road brought on a massive flood of nostalgic childhood memories from Australia. Have your characters call a stroll in nature a 'bushwalk', their nightgowns a 'nightie' and each other 'mate', and I'll be a little curled up ball of homesickness. Can I just spread the love for these little shits who warmed my heart? 
""I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Griggs."" Anson Choi feigns surprise. ""What's her name?""""I didn't actually catch her name,"" Griggs continues.""Lily,"" Raffaela says over her shoulder and this time I give her a sideways look.""Great to know that I'm in love with a girl with a cool name.""""It's Taylor's middle name,"" Raffaela calls back again.Placing Raffaela in the path of an oncoming car becomes one of the major priorities of the next ten seconds of my life.
With their hysterical fits and unexpected violent outbursts coming from gentle characters? 
""Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?""
On the Jellicoe Road is a beautiful book that will move you, grip you, and enchant you with fleshed out characters, an air of mystery, and a touching story. For those of you who enjoyed this book but haven't picked up any other books by Melina Marchetta, I highly recommend Saving Francesca.",43,default,"['mental-health', 'realistic-fiction', '2016-faves']"

I thought about Kintsukoroi long after I read On The Jellicoe Road. You know Kintsukoroi, the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold or silver lacquer. Making the piece more beautiful for having been broken. I am not usually given in to melodramatics but this beautiful book evoked a riot of feelings in my ice-box of a heart.On The Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham overlapping with that of another mysterious narrator whose point of view is in italic.Taylor Markham is a leader of one of the houses at the Jellicoe School, her history is riddled with more questions than answers. Unanchored to anyone, or to anything, she feels lost, an outsider to her own story looking in.“Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?”She craves history, and Hannah, her only link to the past, had disappeared without a word. In her quest to find Hannah, with a jumbled and unfinished manuscript as her only clue, Taylor inadvertently comes to grips with the pain of her mother's abandonment and fleeting memories of being loved. While Taylor is finally confronting her past, she is also leading the Jellicoe School in territory wars against the Townie and the Cadets. The Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a boy whom Taylor spent a few eventful days with years ago.I am not fond of young adult books dealing with difficult topics because the teenage angst and drama irk me off, but On The Jellicoe Road is the exception. Of course, with the topics explored in this book, some angst and drama are inevitable, but Melina Marchetta is never heavy handed with them. She writes emotions on levels we, or at least I, understand.“What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.”She can pack one hell of a left hook right in the solar plexus with a single word, a testament of her compelling, lyrical writing. Damn you, Marchetta.The characters are terrific, they are raw, layered and relatable. I wanted to hang-out with Taylor, Jonah, Raffy and Santangelo in the tree-house. I still do, honestly. Taylor is especially complicated. Who wouldn't be, given her situation. The most remarkable thing about Taylor and her narrative is the air of pragmatic self-destructiveness. Like she is always on the verge of spiraling down.“I do keep him at the back of my mind for those times I get me hopes raised about something. So then I can slap myself into reality and remind myself of what happens when you let someone into your sacred space.”...but yeah, read the book if she truly does.The plot ties up neatly in the end and I am more than satisfied with the ending, but it takes some patience to get to the ending. You see, like Kintsukoroi, On The Jellicoe Road starts with broken pieces or fragments of a life, of a story, that may not make sense at first but as the the novel progresses, the pieces will fit and by the end you'll have yourself a beautiful whole story. So do yourself a favor and just let yourself be lost in this gem of a book,don't even back-track. I promise, it pays off in the end.On The Jellicoe Road is a story of friendship, love, forgiveness and grief. It's so much more, but I'll end it at that. I did not cry but that's more on my damaged tear ducts than the book,but okay fine, I admit, it also kind of, well, broke me. Yet somehow I am filled with hope for the characters in the book and for the young adult genre. Melina Marchetta folks, as long as she writes, there'll be good young adult books to read.",43,default,['heartrenders']

What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him. More…Well, it’s been over twelve hours and I still don’t know how to start to review this book. I thought I gave myself enough time for a better perspective and drier eyes, but hot DAMN I’m crying again! I don’t like to cry, and I don’t do it very often because I can’t stand how it feels. But would I trade the emotional experience of this book for steadier breathes and calmer emotions? Not a chance! I’ll keep the experience of Jellicoe Road thank you very much.Melina Marchetta is a true contender for top YA Novelist of the century. She has a gift that I can’t describe because her stories manage to make me feel emotions that frankly I can’t explain. Her poetic narrative conveys moments of brilliance that do nothing short of take my breath away and not always because I’m sobbing like a baby. But, because I’m so moved by her honest and magical ability of capturing her characters and putting them on stage in a way that makes me lean forward, open my mind and expose my heart. Jellicoe Road owned me for the six plus hours it had my attention and I’ll tell you right now, it’ll own me every year maybe twice a year because there is no way in HALE I’ll put this book on the shelf to collect dust. This story is one I’ll be revisiting multiple times and if anyone wants to journey with me, then grab a page and hold on because you’re in for a ride. Now, I’d be remiss not to mention that the first 100 pages or so had me in a state of blissful confusion, but then this moment happens where the cloud is lifted and you find yourself connecting with every single element this book has to offer. Color me awed. In this story, I had the privilege of meeting Taylor Markham. She was abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven and her story is one of living in a boarding school and being challenged to lead during a time and place where her school faces Townies and Cadets in a power struggle of a long standing territory war. This book is so carefully designed using two tragic moments in time and blending a large cast of characters that take the reader on a journey of loss, grief and ultimate hope. Jellicoe Road is extremely character driven with Taylor & Ben leading the boarding school; Santangelo and the Mullet Brothers representing the townies; and Jonah Griggs and Choi negotiating for the Cadets. There is also a cast of past characters including Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude that have their own story to share, which serves as the catalyst for the territory wars and the tragedy that transcends through to the present. Taylor and Jonah Griggs were a perfect pair. I loved every moment they spent together and every emotion they shared. Wow, if I could bottle those moments up, I’d carry them around with me forever! Okay and I just have to say that Jonah Griggs… Ummmm Wow! Just wow! By the way, you say both Jonah and Griggs… it’s a state of mind… not just a name. I will never forget this character. At first I didn’t like him at all, but then he brought a bucket of water to the game and I knew he was going to tug at my heart strings. Mission accomplished. ~emphatic pointing at self~ I’m a Jonah Griggs fan.Overall, this book is more than a story, it’s truly an experience that shouldn’t be missed. JR grapples with tough subjects as I mentioned before, but in the end there is growth, survival and self revelation. From Taylor Markham I learned that you have the right to want more in life, but if you do, you need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all your might, and when you have it do the best you can with it. Absolutely beautiful!Finally, a huge thank you and hugs to Alexa that has been trying to get me to read this book since May 2010. Yes, I had the receipt in the book and that’s the time stamp. Thanks for asking me out on a book date with the bestEST rec of all time! MUAH! >.<Favorite Quotes Please note, if I listed all of my favorite quotes, I’d be retyping this entire book, so I’ll just mention a few I don’t want to soon forget.""It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you.

Those exact lines were the ones I read a long time ago, on a post on Tumblr, I immediately google them, I wanted to know where they came from. That's how I found this book. I first read it last year in November, I was about 20 pages in on my Kindle; I suddenly stopped, and ordered a physical copy. That's how long it took me to realize that there was something about this book, even if the first chapters were a bit confusing. But do you know what's the best thing about Jellicoe Road? Reading Jellicoe Road for a second time. You can actually appreciate its magnificence. From the writing, to the characters and the story, they compliment each other beautifully, in a way I haven't read before. This is one of those books that you probably won't find, and when you find them and read them, you know it's going to stay with you for the rest of your life. It's one of a kind, unique, uncommon. This book is placed in a genre where the banalities, concurrent stories, uninteresting; insipid characters, and romanticized unhealthy relationships exist in abundance. So I get why this might be underestimated. I know with certainty that I'll read this many times in the future, and I recomend it to you, from the bottom of my heart.",39,default,['favorites']

I actually considered putting Jellicoe Road down. I didn't, though, because I had to have something to read on my breaks and lunches, and my Toni Morrison hold hadn't come in yet. I can't believe, now, that I almost stopped reading this book.The characters are incredibly real and distinct. The emotions are raw, genuine. The interactions between the characters are priceless.

Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”  This was almost a star lower, except for the fact that I could not stop thinking about this book after reading it. That's the mark of a great story.When Taylor is eleven her mother abandons her. At the age of fourteen her only friend betrays her. At the age of seventeen she is selected to be the leader of her school in the annual territory wars versus the Townies and the Cadets. Her mentor Hannah has gone missing leaving Taylor feeling incredibly alone.First off, I want to say I am still a bit conflicted about my rating for one reason. When I was reading the book, I couldn't put it down. But when I put it down.... it remained down until I made myself pick it back up. In the end I binge read the last 200 pages which were excellent. But the confusing beginning definitely took away from the book as a whole. And with the italicized portions, I have a hard time connecting with characters that are from a different perspective unless I know why they matter. Luckily, I knew it would come in, but as a bad reader, I usually skip those parts and I'm glad I didn't.  “Hold my hand because I might disappear.”  Taylor was such an amazing complex character. She was indecisive but not in an annoying way. It was understandable with all of the shit she went through in her life that it would be difficult to trust and love others for her. Once everything came together in the end, it was easy to see why she was so messed up.But the best part for me? Frickin Jonah Griggs. That boy stole my heart more than once, and his tragic story made my heart bleed for him. He was another character that ended up developing really well by the end and I kind of wish there was another book just so we know his future (not that it's a mystery at the end, it's just open).   ""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”   Third best character was Jude. I'd also like a prequel novel giving more detail on him, Narnie, Webb and the others. I felt like there was so much more we as a reader didn't know. So overall I enjoyed this book. I didn't love it, but I can recognize that it's among the better teen literature out there in the world. This is one of those books that doesn't assume the reader is stupid.

I read this book in 2014 but it is still on my favorite shelves because it was really such a beautifully told and emotional story. If you are interested now is a great time to pick it up.It amazes me the way the Malina Marchette can build and intertwine the lives of the people in her story. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, she makes you care about all of them. Not one of them is perfect, each is flawed and they seem so real that it is hard to remember sometimes you are just in the middle of a story. They all have pasts, presents and futures that are never simple, each is rich and you feel like you know them and that maybe you will carry those people around with you forever.
“We were playing Rock, Paper, Scissors,"" she told him once. ""I was paper and she was rock so I lived and she died.”
Sometimes it is as simple as that, one tiny everyday thing will change your life forever. Sometimes one event will bind you to someone or a group of people for the rest of your lives. Jellicoe Road is the story of two such groups of people.The story is told in two parts and although I was a little confused at the beginning it all flushes out beautifully so just ride with it. First there is the story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude and Fitz and how they met and became friends all on the Jellicoe Road. The Second is about Taylor whose mother left her at a 7-11 on the Jellicoe Road seven years ago. Taylor goes to the Jellicoe school and every year for 6 weeks there is a turf war between the Jellicoe School, Town Kids and some Cadets. As the story is revealed little by little you see how everything is connected and you take the journey with Taylor from a girl who was once abandoned, to a girl who finds a home, friends and her place in the world.The writing of the book is so beautiful that I believe I have more marks and highlights in this book than any other I’ve ever read. The story of the 5 kids who met on the Jellicoe road is disastrously beautiful tying in with Taylor’s story “Instinct tells me to go to Hannah's, but she doesn't live there anymore and that's when I realize the major difference between my mother and Hannah. My mother deserted me at the 7-Eleven, hundred of kilometers away from home.Hannah, however, did the unforgivable.She deserted me in our own backyard.”Taylor feels so abandoned and alone, she keeps everyone at a distance because when people get too close that is when she gets hurt the most. That is the lesson her mother taught her. She is so prickly but you honestly want to just protect her character because already at 17 she has been through more than most people go through in a lifetime. As the turf war starts with the Cadet’s and Townies we get to meet a few other characters. Griggs and Taylor have a past of sorts and it seems their journey together might not be over yet. Griggs in a way was just as broken as Taylor, but she helped him in a way she doesn’t even know in a way that will bind them forever.
“He stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”
Every character burns so bright and they all have fantastic dialogue that seems so natural. I love Griggs back story and how he and Taylor originally met. I couldn’t stop reading and even though I flushed out how parts of the stories intertwined together there are still plenty of surprises that I did not see coming. I wanted to wrap Taylor and Griggs together in bubble wrap and protect them from the world. I hoped for many of the other characters and their story lines. I was emotional and even characters that I didn’t think I would forgive for the parts they played in the story Marchetta was able to give me a different view and when you see the whole picture I found empathy and understanding for them. This is a book that the words and the characters will really stick with you. That when not if you read it again you will see all the beauty and hope that lives even through tragedy“When it was over, she gathered him in her arms. And told him the terrible irony of her life.That she had wanted to be dead all those years while her brother had been alive. That had been her sin.And this was her penance.Wanting to live when everyone else seemed dead.”Marchetta is a master at what many authors try to do but most don’t accomplish. She makes you live the story. She doesn’t tell you what happens, she shows you everything, makes you feel it along with the characters. She is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors of all time.",35,default,"['re-read', 'ya', 'awesome-audio', '4-5-stars']"

""He is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen and it's not about his face, but the life force I can see in him. It's the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he's saying, 'Here I am world, are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?'""
Taylor Markham is the leader of the Jellicoe boarding school's underground community. Her leadership starts just as the territory wars begin with opposing groups, the Townies and the Cadets. Taylor's mind is not focused on the territorial fight to win, for she has discovered that her caregiver Hannah has disappeared without a trace. Taylor is forced, time and again, to deal with the leader of the cadets, Jonah Griggs, and face the history they have together. She must also face the distant memories of her past that are now coming to the surface. But this is just the beginning of the story...Breathtaking, surreal, lyrical, haunting, tragic, and beautiful, this book is truly an art form. When I first started the book, I did find it confusing, but I persevered. Trust me when I say that it will all pay off in the end, as the stories become more clear and the mysteries revealed. There are so many extreme emotions that this book brings out, including grief, and the tragic question as to why every parent is not able to be a healthy, capable, giving parent...they are just trying to survive themselves. The book also inspires such joy and beauty that you can sometimes forget the extreme lows that can happen in life, if just for a short while. The first thing I did when I finished the book was take my almost four year twin boys, and hug them close. My older son was not at home, and will only sometimes let me hug him, only very briefly. The next thing I did was look up some lingering questions I had about the story. I came across a thread that advised that you read this book twice, as there are so many clues and tie-ins that can easily be missed the first time around, and that provide even deeper meaning for the story within a story. This is a brilliant masterpiece, and yes, I started reading it again...

I adore all the characters so much and enjoyed this reread a lot. “You want us to be there tomorrow?” Santangelo asks quietly. I nod. “Done.” I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it.“What are you so sad about?” Santangelo says to me. “We’re going to know him for the rest of our lives.”Reread Sept 2018: I was in the mood to reread another one of my favorites. It’s been three and a half years since I’ve first read Jellicoe Road, so it’s about damn time!Aaaaand this book still has a special place in my heart. Content warnings for: suicide, suicide ideation, drug addiction & drug abuse, child neglect, child abuse, death, grief, mentions of pedophilia, domestic violence, cancer, car crashBuddy read with Chelsea, Jen, Anna, Jennifer and Harriet.5 stars!!This book made me feel things I don't think I've ever felt while reading. It made me feel all the emotions. EVERYTHING. Confusion, annoyance, shock, love, awe, sadness, anger, heartbreak, hope.... Everything! I will need a lot of time to get over this book. It snuck up on me when I least expected it, hooked me and never let me go. 
So why would I want someone to be my everything when one day they might not be around? What will be left of me then?
Wow. This book was so much more than I expected it to be. When I was done, I wanted to start it again because.. just because I needed to experience these feelings again. I can't explain why I loved this book as much as I did, but boy did I love it. “If you weren't driving, I'd kiss you senseless,"" I tell him.He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly.""Not driving any more.”I was hooked from page 1 and that was mostly because I was so confused. The beginning of the book just doesn't make any sense not knowing yet what you'll later find out. So it was mostly the mystery that hooked me, the strangeness of the story, and wanting to understand what was going on. I'd be lying though if I said that the mystery, the not knowing what was happening, didn't frustrate me. Because it did. But for some reason it didn't make me stop reading or made me enjoy the read any less. Honestly, my annoyance just fueled my need to keep reading, to figure out the root of this special, confusing story. 
“Hold my hand because I might disappear.”
Because when I started to understand more and more, it was so worth it for me! This story is just not like anything I've ever read before and I really did love every second of it. The characters are some of my absolute favorites ever. From Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude and Fitz to Taylor, Jonah, Ben, Jessa, Santangelo and Raffy, they are all so special and kind of everything to me. I couldn't get enough of their stories and my heart hurt so much because of what they all had to go through. Their character development was astounding and their dialogue made me laugh and tear up, depending on the topic. I loved every second of it. “He stops and looks at me. 'I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.”There were so many moments that warmed my heart, so many scenes I just had to highlight and I wish I could share every single one with you, but I had to limit myself to only a few, unfortunately. ""Who do you in believe in?"" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. ""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""I think one of my favorite characters is actually Raffy. Her constant optimism, her faith and loyalty, especially towards Taylor makes her one of the most amazing friends and I have so much love for her. Now that I think about it, there's some quality in every one of the characters that I could rant and fangirl about, but I'm trying to keep this review at least somewhat short, so just know that I love every single one of them in their own weird way. Ben Cassidy everybody:""Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face.""While the beginning was confusing, and huge parts of the middle extremely funny and entertaining, the ending... oh god the ending broke my heart, in the best way possible. Now that I know what was going on in the beginning, I would love to go back and read it again. I'm sure it would be even more heartbreaking to read it (Anna already told me so), but what can I say. I'm a masochist. ""She's the only person who gets away with calling Santangelo a ""little shit"" and once in a while she'll go for the collective and refer to both Griggs and Santangelo as those ""two little shits."" Most of the time the ""two little shits"" take it on the chin but sometimes Santangelo says, ""I'm fucking out of here,"" and his mom warns, ""Don't you dare swear, you little shit.""Seriously, this story is so fucking special and just everything.

It is the kind of book that if 5 is the top rating makes me rethink all my other ratings because if this is a 5, I have some 5 star books that might be 3’s. I haven’t been this passionate about a book since Sempre and although I can pimp that book out to a wider range of people, this book has surpassed it as my favorite YA romance book ( not even sure if YA romance is the right description for it). This is a story of friendship, growing up, hurt, love, losing oneself, finding oneself, there is mystery and it is written in such a different way that it keeps you thinking throughout. For me the main outline of a YA book is to build, build, hit you over the head and then in the end start to make you feel heeled. That is not how this book is handled. I would say this book evolves and unfolds. And as things get unfolded the story has a natural progression that doesn’t feel forced and I was just so sucked into. After a certain point in the book I literally had to take it in chunks. I would read and stop and think about it and gather myself, make a status and get back into it and when I got back into the intensity was right where I left it. This is the story of Jellicoe Road. There are 2 stories going on in this book. The story is told from Taylor’s voice and a story from a manuscript that is separated from the main story in italics. (I would not recommend this book to audio readers because of that fact) The main story is told in the voice of Taylor Markham. She goes to the Jellicoe School which is a state school, made up with many state wards and people who want their children educated in the bush. The story is focused around a war game that is played out between the cadets, Jellicoe students and the townies. We’re kind of thrown into the story and it unfolds as it goes so the beginning can be tad confusing until you figure out what is going on. Taylor gets dumped on Jellicoe road by her mother and is raised by Hannah who Taylor suspects didn’t come by her by accident. With her high school years coming to an end the mystery around her mother starts to consume her and she set out for answers. **Idiot Paragraph** Not part of official review. First of all I almost didn’t read this book. I got it from the library and have had so many library books and buddy reads that this book had been getting shuffled aside. I finished a book in work( I work nightshift ) and opened it to see if I was into the voice. I had no idea what the book was about, NONE. I got it because Catie and Tatiana agreed that it was a 5 star book (more my fantasy go tos) that doesn’t happen often. I scan down my list and there is a wider range of people with the same rating. The only part I remember is Catie saying the beginning was a little confusing but she likes figuring things out. **Idiot part** There is writing in italics and they tell you pretty early on that it is a manuscript that Taylor is reading. Wellll I missed it. I’m like 20% in trying to piece together this story, trying to figure out whether it’s a dream or 5 personalities in her head and boy was I down all kinds of paths. I actually went back and had to reskim the first 20% when the confusion in my head got out of hand.This book gave me chills and although I have welled up on 2 books in the past because of the sadness I felt for the characters this was the first book that I actually had a liquid type substance around the area of my eyes from the pure happiness at times. And that feeling wasn’t just at the end like you feel in many novels after you get to the top and you are finally rewarded there were several throughout the story.In the end there is a mystery, love stories, bonds of lifelong friendships and just a great story that I would recommend to anyone except those that have to have sex in their books. If you need sex keep moving if not read this book now and don’t let it simmer in the TBR pile like I did.",29,default,['favorite']

Me. Just me....alone with a majority of people of who LOVED, ADORED, OBSESSED over this particular novel. And oh, dear God please don't hate me (especially you, my dear, sweet Anna) but.....I couldn't love this book. I tried. I tried so, so, SOOOOOO hard, but, in the end, I never once did I feel myself drawn back to this story. When I put the book down, it was just that-I put it down. It didn't exist beyond when it was in my hands. And I know that's not how it's supposed to feel. ""What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.Gawd, you guys I wanted to love this so hard. As I was tossing and turning on this horrible last Sunday night (the depression of not loving this book was a visceral feeling), I came to a crushing realization: I'd rather be fighting my Sunday night demons (I can NEVER sleep on Sunday nights, but that's neither here nor there...) attempting to sleep even when I knew I couldn't than reading more of this book. And that kept me from sleeping, as well. I repeatedly asked myself, 'What's wrong with me?' 'Why am I the only person who didn't like this?'. And, admittedly, I still hate that I couldn't find much to identify with.Being part of him isn't just anything. It's kind of everything.I think Marchetta's ideas are so profound, but I just hate how she delivers them. She's lost me in both books I've attempted to read and I think I just need to realize that this author is not for me. It doesn't mean she's not an excellent writer-she is. But, and this is going to sound so harsh, if the only tears I cried were from boredom? There's a problem. Just because a book is beautiful and has poetic writing doesn't mean it can't be boring and....for me....it was boring until like 60%. Even in the end when it was supposed to all tie together, I finally just didn't care. I don't think I would have anyway, honestly. I'm such a bad reader-I really only cared about Jonah and Taylor, and I feel like they hardly had any real, tangible time together.""What's with what you're wearing?"" Griggs asks while we stand outside waiting for the others.""It's pretty hideous, isn't it?"" I say.""Don't force me to look at it,"" he says. ""It's see-through.""That kills the conversation for a couple of seconds.And, I swear this is the last negative section, that's my biggest problem. Why does there have to be so many people on each page? It's confusing, it made it drag, and I didn't get NEAR enough Jonah...at all. And the territory wars-I'm sorry, but how could this be a main plot point??? It was fun at first, and then I was like...please, please, PLEASE stop-they didn't make sense. Or, I just was too far gone to care...again.Though very little worked for me, there were some shining moments. Jonah. Oh my goodness did I love him. He and Taylor together. All of their moments separate from the school were amazing and fun to follow, but it just took so damn long to get there. I loved the way he looked at her and how he was always so protective of her. How he would do anything to make sure she stayed safe. And, most importantly, how they changed each other's lives forever.""You care about nothing, you piece of shit!""I'm on the verge of tears, like I always seem to be these days, and I hear the catch in my voice and I hate myself for it. He throws me off him and I can tell there is a fury in him.""Never,"" he tells me in a tone full of ice, ""underestimate who or what I care for.""Okay, so, I've said my piece and it's clear I'm in the minority-it's clear that everyone thinks all the things I hated are what make an excellent story, so don't take my word for it. Just know, this book is beautiful in it's own right....it's just not the book for me.Anyway...now everyone can fight over my carcass...sorry.

Sometimes I save books that I feel like I will love for when I really need them. I thought this book was going to be one of those books that I would love because it is so loved on Goodreads and it sounds so interesting. Instead of loving it, I really disliked it overall and that is because the first 50% is atrocious. I almost marked it as a DNF at 55% because of how bored I was but I powered on and I was able to finish it. I think I've narrowed down the main problems with the first half. First of all, Marchetta makes the whole land war thing really vague and I was so confused as to what it actually was. I mean how hard is it to say its like a game? I was like ""is this a dystopian novel, what the hell is going on?"" at the start. Marchetta also makes the whole thing really confusing with the two different stories and the time jumps and the dreams vs reality aspect. Instead of being mysterious and cool, I thought it was muddled and boring. Also, I guessed how the whole thing connected correctly and so the whole thing was just a waiting game for me and not like this crazy good revelation. Secondly, Taylor was the other main problem in part one. She was like completely self-absorbed and it felt like she didn't really care about the other characters and she was like really separated from everything that happened around her. This created a disconnect between me and her and me and the other characters (because it was all told from her point of view). And its not even like characters like Taylor are the problem, it was just a problem in this particular book. Basically I thought the first 50% was like a really bad mystery novel because the author clearly tried to be mysterious, she kept dangling things in front of the readers without divulging anything meaningful, I guessed what was going to happen because it was so obvious and Taylor wasn't being completely forthcoming with the readers or herself. The second half was literally like reading a completely different book - Taylor completely changed, the whole tone of the book changed, it was clear and concise, I could connect to the characters and I even felt emotional at bits. If the whole book had had those qualities, this could have been a great book but then I guess there would be a lot less pages. I liked bits of the writing. I thought it was quite easy to read and I could see myself liking one of her other books if the story was different. The romance was annoying. So. Much. Angst! I did not ship it. I mean, what solidified me not shipping it was when Jonah pinned her against a wall, lifting her off the ground in a fit of rage. Relationship goals? I think not. Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I'm in the minority though so if you're reading this review and you haven't read the book, you could read it and love it like the rest of my Goodreads friends. I probably would be open to reading more by Melina Marchetta in the future.------------------------------------""""I'm the same age my father was when he died,"" she told me.

5.5 stars!
After reading “Saving Francesca” and hearing so many good reviews on this book, I had decided to pick up another one of Melina Marchetta’s young adult novels and I came across “Jellicoe Road” (some versions it is called On the Jellicoe Road). “Jellicoe Road” is a Printz Award winning book and I was absolutely blown away by how emotional and exciting this novel really is! Taylor Markham was eleven years old when she was abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road. Now seventeen years old, Taylor is not only the new leader of her boarding school dorm, but she will soon uncover many secrets about her life before she came on Jellicoe Road, especially after her mentor Hannah, suddenly disappears from the school without a word to Taylor. Not only that but Taylor soon meets up with her old sweetheart, Jonah Griggs and she suspects that Jonah knows more about herself then Taylor knows. Now, Taylor must go on a journey to find out the truth about her mother’s abandonment and the whereabouts of Hannah and what she will discover about her true past will change her life forever!Wow…just wow for the umpteenth time. Now, I know that I had mentioned before that I loved reading Saving Francesca and I still love that book, but after reading “Jellicoe Road,” I think that “Jellicoe Road” is a few leagues above “Saving Francesca” in terms of storytelling and character development. I loved the way that Melina Marchetta build up the mystery surrounding Taylor’s past and how it affects her current state. This was probably the main reason why I loved reading “Jellicoe Road” because I was constantly sitting on the edge of my seat every time certain clues were being thrown out regarding Taylor’s past such as why Hannah suddenly left the school and why her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road all those years ago. I also liked the character Taylor Markham herself and even though there were times where her aggressive attitude towards other people annoyed me a bit, I can sort of sympathize with her because of how she finds it hard to trust anyone after her mother abandoned her and Hannah, the closest person she had to a family, suddenly left the school without telling Taylor. I really enjoyed Taylor’s relationship with Jonah Griggs, Raffaela, Ben, and Chaz Santangelo as they are close friends with her and I loved the way that these characters all tried to help Taylor through her trust issues with other people and also, showed her the true meaning of friendship. I really enjoyed the way that Melina Marchetta set this story in Australia since I love reading stories located in other countries and I also loved the way that Melina Marchetta described the Jellicoe Road as being a road where trees sort of hang over the roads, like a canopy and that just gives me a wonderful image about the road every time I read this book!   I really liked the scenes where Taylor was reading Hannah’s manuscripts (the italicized sections of the book) as they tell the stories about the characters Tate, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, and Webb and even though the stories were truly heartbreaking and touching, the significance of the manuscript scenes is definitely something that shocked me after I finished reading this book! For a novel that is aimed at young adults, there is some pretty strong language in this novel including dropping the “f” bomb and the “s” word. If anyone does not like reading strong language in a novel, then it might be best to skim over these scenes. This novel also deals with the subject of child abandonment and anyone who has ever gone through this situation, might find it hard to read through this book.Overall, “Jellicoe Road” is a truly emotional and engaging novel that anyone who is a fan of Melina Marchetta’s works or love reading young adult novels about real teenagers dealing with real life will love for many years to come!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog",26,default,"['sexy-bad-boy-hero', 'ronyell-s-epinions-reviews', 'my-blog-reviews', 'young-adult-teen-books', 'contemporary-romance', 'printz-award', 'australian-books', '1st-person-pov', 'melina-marchetta', 'australian-hero-or-heroine']"

Marchetta wraps you up from the very beginning. And not giving answers for half a book is a risky move but somehow it worked perfectly. Mixed with interesting characters and smart dialog, Jellicoe reads not only as an interesting and bittersweet story but an emotional ride all way through. It is not a mystery masterpiece and I did see some of the plot twists coming, but by then I was really into Taylor’s life so it didn’t bother me much. This could’ve turned easily into those very common drama-all-over-your-face books, thanks Jesus that wasn’t the case. 

Sucedió en el camino de Jellicoe...

Diría que es un libro bastante tricky. Y solo para lectores pacientes. Por mucho rato, casi la mitad del libro, no vas a saber ni que onda con nada. No sabes que tan en serio es la parte de guerras en las “guerras territoriales” que se hacen en Jellicoe. Y entre eso, las alucinaciones/sueños que tiene la protagonista Taylor y los pasajes de los 5 niños que se conocieron ahí antes de que ella llegara, puede revolver un poco. El libro seria una gran relectura, de hecho.Pero por eso mismo, me pique con la historia. El no saber es algo que me puede mucho. Así que no solté el libro, casi. Bueno, el kindle whatever. La forma de escribir es lo más interesante, se lee de forma bastante íntima. Muy absorbente, emotiva y divertida cuando era necesario. La autora recurre mucho al mostrar y no decir. En muy pocas ocasiones te toparas con cosas como “TAL persona es en realidad TAL persona” o “Tal persona, en realidad si hizo esta TAL cosa”  En lo personal me gusta pero no creo que para un YA sea lo adecuado, o sea no me imagino a alguien de 13-14 años leyendo esto y captando todo lo que haya que captar. Aunque siempre hay excepciones. Lo que me hace no darle las 5 es lo de siempre yo creo. Esto de Ficción realista o Libros contemporáneos, o como quieras llamarle, no es lo mío. Nunca puedo hacer clic enteramente. Aunque hay misterio, no es lo fuerte del libro la verdad, esta bastante estándar pero la autora hace un gran trabajo de camuflaje con todo lo demás y se te van algunas cosas que al final podrías considerar algo obvias. Solo dos cositas si las vi venir, todo lo del Ermitaño y el Brigadier. Y aunque todos los personajes están muy bien trabajados no conecto totalmente con ellos. Chaz y Raffy fueron mis favoritos, comoquiera. <3Muy recomendado si quieres algo que se sienta ligero pero tenga mucha mas sustancia de lo que aparenta. Y si estas de ánimos para una lectura con desarrollo lento. Yo se que la mayoría tira el libro por la ventana si no hay algún giro intenso en las primeras 50 paginas, pero simplemente ese no es mi caso. Espero no enfadar a nadie con esto (y si lo hice, ni modo) pero los nuevos libros están mal acostumbrando mucho a los lectores. Tiene que haber acción TODO el maldito libro, o un montón de chistes estupidos para no aburrirlos y me pone de malas. Razón por la cual ya no considero la frase “tiene mucha acción” como algo positivo, solo como algo extra. Y razón por la cual la frase “tiene un inicio lento” ya no me asusta.Y Marchetta hace eso. Se toma su tiempo. Para todo. Y vale la pena la espera. PD: Que dices? Que Marchetta tiene una trilogía de Fantasía? Considérenme on board, bitches! No cometeré la misma equivocación y lo leeré en ingles",26,default,[]

""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)"" was used super-effectively in the trailer for ""Where the Wild Things Are"", but it's a song cut from the same cloth of this book, if there ever is a movie it, I'd think this song would have to be dusted off for another trailer. Or maybe they could get away with using ""Wake Up"" in this imaginary movie of the future. My goodreads friends have probably written better reviews of this book than I will write here. I'd recommend reading their reviews. Part of me wanted to give this four stars, just because it's probably kind of a girly book, and because there are a couple of loose ends in the novel that seem kind of forced to tie themselves up nicely. A lot of people I know also love this book, and the contrarian part of me wanted to say, it was good but it wasn't that good. But it is that good, and it's strengths are so strong that they allowed me to overlook the couple of contrived ways of wrapping up the story. And it's not really a girly book at all, but by the packaging of the book I can't see it getting read by that many teenage boys. Actually do teenagers like this book? My couple of goodreads friends who read this whom are close to being teenagers were the people who rated this lowest. It's a fairly complex book for teenagers, like the narrator's personality it's not the friendliest book when you first encounter. It's the kind of book that can infuriate you at the start if you try to hard to make sense of everything that is going on. I didn't worry about this though. Too many friends loved this book, and they weren't all the type that could gush over a Ben Marcus like novel that has no easy way to circumnavigate the text. I trusted that the author would do her job and that when things needed to make sense they would, and they did although it took me about a hundred and fifty pages before I had grasp on who the all the characters backstory were. But, it's nice when books take their time to unfold, I just don't know how much patience kids (teens) would have with it. I like to think I'm wrong though, and teens are better readers than their adult counterparts who whine like babies if a book demands anything more than turning a few pages. I'm floundering more than usual with this review. It's a beautiful and sad book and I'd recommend it, even if I can't write a review that does it any justice.

On the Jellicoe Road is, without a doubt, Melina Marchetta's most profound, heart-wrenching, and ultimately best book. It goes without saying that this woman is a Goddess of Literature. She has an unrivaled command over words, an ability to make even the most stoic hearts melt, and her stories make you see the world in an entirely new light. I cannot give this book or its author enough praise and I cannot write a review that can possibly do justice to this book, but I can try. Most people have that one moment that changes their life forever - Taylor Markham had two. The first was when her mother abandoned her at the age of 11 in a 7-Eleven near Jellicoe Road, the location of a boarding school for children who are neglected or have violent/criminal tendencies. The second was when Hannah, Taylor's mentor, friend, and care-taker, mysteriously abandons her without a word, leaving the school and leaving behind 17-year-old Taylor, who is now in charge of a game of territory wars with the Townies, locals from neighboring towns, and the Cadets, who happen to spend several weeks in the wilderness. Taylor, who isn't even sure that she can handle her new-found role of responsibility, is now forced to become a leader, take on Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets, who happens to know her far better than she'd like simply because they shared a past, and do her best not to worry about Hannah's disappearance which may or may not have something to do with her mother, all while suffering from a recurring dream of a young boy who is desperately trying to tell her something. On the Jellicoe Road is Taylor's story - the tale of her past, her present, the answers to all the unanswered questions in her life, and ultimately, it is a remarkable journey of heart-break, sorrow, and hope. When I first began On the Jellicoe Road I thought I had finally stumbled upon a Marchetta story I wouldn't like. The beginning was good, interesting, and even mildly gripping, but it by no means led me to understand the hype surrounding this novel. I was confused beyond measure by various elements of the plot and I very nearly gave up on it - but then, it started to creep up on me. I had set it down for a few hours to finish some work, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to know what happened. I had to know who the ""Fucked-Up Five"" were. I had to know how their story related to Taylor's. On the Jellicoe Road is not simply the story of Taylor, it is also the story of her entire family, before she even came to be. It is a profound and moving tale that explores topics of far more depth and sorrow than Marchetta has ever explored in the past. It is a story about death, murder, guilt, and depression, but it is also a story of hope, forgiveness, love, and honor. It is a story about finding the people who truly care about you in life and learning to never take what you have - or who you have - for granted. On the Jellicoe Road is told primarily from Taylor’s POV, but it also contains glimpses into the past – into a friendship that came before Taylor and a love so strong it existed after her. Speaking of love, there is so much of it in this book. Each and every friendship, relationship, and romance was beautiful and touching. I don’t think I’ve ever come to care for characters as much as I cared for the cast of On the Jellicoe Road. Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Jude, Hannah, Santangelo, Jessa, Webb…the list goes on and on. There wasn’t a single character I didn’t feel deeply for, a single character for which I didn’t wish utter happiness and didn’t feel their complete despair. There are such few stories in this world that have purposeful characters who are each understood by the reader just as well as the narrator, but On the Jellicoe Road is one of those few books. Although Marchetta is primarily a contemporary YA writer, I am somehow constantly surprised by the depth of her love stories. Her romances are slow to build, taking their time, introducing each character until you are practically dying of anticipation for them to get together and when they finally do, it is so sweet, so perfect, and so human that you cannot help but sob from joy. That is quality and vibrancy of emotion that Marchetta sparks. Jonah Griggs is definitely by favorite Marchetta boy of them all – I love him more than Will Trombal, more than Tom Mackee, more than Jimmy Hailler, more than Finnikin and Froi, more than any other character I have ever come across. In some ways, his sorrow felt deeper, sadder, and more tangible to me than Taylor’s did and I loved him all the more for it. I loved him for his understanding of Taylor when no one else did. I loved him for being able to read her mind so perfectly. I loved him for his jealousy, his possessiveness, his confidence, his vulnerability, his need to be loved just as much as everyone else. If you take only one thing away from this book, it will most likely be that you need a Jonah Griggs in your life, because I definitely need one in mine. I know my review is vague, but I don't want to say anything more about this story. I didn't know much about it before I began and I would have been terribly upset if I understood the full complexity of this plot before I read it. This is a story that is meant to be read and felt by putting together the pieces yourself and making sense of what it means - not only in the book, but to yourself as well. I feel as if each and every one of Marchetta's novels has a profound impact on her readers, but all in a different and unique way. I myself can't say what it was that affected me so deeply, but Marchetta is able to capture human emotions, human nature, and human feeling so perfectly, that you cannot help but feel the sadness of each character. Sorrow is a feeling that is impossible to describe, yet Marchetta manages to create a story that describes this sorrow and makes it tangible, but not to the point where it crushes it, but to the point where it brings you hope and the strength to overcome your own hurdles and fears in life. Whatever it may be, On the Jellicoe Road is truly inspirational. If Taylor can go through everything she's been through, if her friends and family can suffer through their sorrow and pull through in the end, then so can I, so can you, the reader, so can anyone in the world. This feeling of hope that Marchetta inspires is so palpable that you can feel it blooming inside you long after you have closed the cover of the novel. I can't articulate how perfect this book was, but it was beautiful. Love cannot even come close to summarizing what I feel about this book. It is one that I will treasure and keep close to my heart - always.",26,default,"['books-that-linger', 'beautiful-prose', 'aussie', 'swoooon', 'teary-eyed-reads', 'favorites', 'life-changing']"

It's... interesting, if you find it interesting to read about teenagers! Having drama! About fucked-up parents! And secrets! About their past! And there's this one boy! In a tree!Yeah, the boy in a tree is a dream about the main character's father and it's all very symbolic and whatever.So, basically it's a contemporary YA novel about a girl named Taylor who was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven and has grown up at a boarding school. She's now a senior (or a ""Year Twelve"" or whatever they call them in Australia) and has just been put in charge of her house by a shadowy cabal of fellow students, which starts the book off with a lot of adolescent politics and power games leading to the annual ""war"" between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets in which Taylor is supposed to be leader and supreme commander of her Jellicoe kiddies. Mostly she spends the time whining, having asthma attacks, emoting about her tormented past and a mother who evidently suffered from all sorts of drug and mental health issues, and trying to uncover what happened to her father and some other people her parents knew. There's one teacher at the Jellicoe school named Hannah whom Taylor kind of sort of looks up to as a role model, and Hannah suddenly disappears, which ramps up Taylor's abandonment issues to eleventy, and since she's already a teenager and therefore living in a universe from which the gravity of her own self-importance allows no light to escape, she pretty much treats all her friends and the younger children at her school like shit, even though for some inexplicable reason they all look up to her.I didn't like Taylor much. Yeah, she's had some rough breaks. But at the point where she's screaming at eleven-year-olds who have had their own rough breaks, not that this would ever occur to her, I lose most of my sympathy for her.The whole ""territory war"" premise, in which the students, the Townies, and the Cadets wage a mock war complete with rules and treaties and things, all passing under the radar of all the responsible adults, was just a pretext to keep throwing Taylor together with Jonah, the leader of the Cadets, the brooding, dangerous, but secretively sensitive boy with his own tormented past who just needs the healing power of poontang as much as Taylor needs the healing power of peen. At the point where he and Taylor have the inevitable sex, the writing is just short of turgid with lots of ""inside"" and ""oneness"" metaphors and as graphic as a ""literary"" Young Adult novel will allow, so it's mostly about Feelings! And breath! And also kind of painful (for Taylor). Like giving teen readers a little taste of the forbidden apple and trying to make it sound kind of cool and exciting but also a little bit scary and vague, which I suppose is exactly how most teenagers view sex before they've tried it.I can see why teenagers, particular younger ones, would go breathless for this book, but I'm too jaded and also, I have to say, this is a very girly book. By which I mean, Taylor's breathless first-person POV running at a constant high pitch of intense emotionalism is obviously meant to resonate with Taylor's peer group, and all of her actions and concerns and preoccupations, she goes about dealing with in a very teen girl way, which is fine but so outside my mindset that I couldn't relate. This is not a book for me.The writing was pretty good for a YA novel, and the story eventually becomes one of adults hiding secrets (surprise!) which are finally dragged into the light and Taylor and Griggs getting some closure on their hurtful pasts, and everyone essentially having a group hug at the end, though not without a bittersweet denouement. It is possible that, boy or not, I would have really liked this book when I was a teen myself. I'd still probably recommend this book for, you know, people who like this kind of book.",25,default,"['contemporary', 'female-protagonist', 'high-school', 'audiobook', 'female-author', 'young-adult', 'teenagers', 'australia']"

If I ever needed a confirmation of what an AMAZING writer Melina Marchetta is, I just got it.I love the detailing and plot building;
 nothing was left to speculation.
 I think, for me, that was one of the most adhering and important things about this book. The ending was resolute, unshakable and haunting and It left me with answers and a crater sized indentation in my heart. There was that awkward stage when I found it hard to connect dots, and understand the significance of the story and most of what was being poured in, but, after the passing of that stage, I was falling into the pages of this book.The story is set in Australia with The Jellicoe (road) as it's focus point. The Jellicoe was so beautifully captured, it seemed almost as if it was a totally different world of it's own--rather than in Australia. I mean, I would escape to the Jellicoe if I could. There was just... this feeling of calmness and serenity that came with reading about it.There was so much love embedded in the story,there was friendship, and ties that bind, and sadness, and god-awful heartbreak. This book was one with a really fascinating quality about it;
 one road 
that was the center of worlds,
one road
 that held and told people's stories, keeping so many memories and secrets that linked so many lives together.I fell so in love with the characters--every single one of them, I shipped every couple in this book like mad ; Taylor and Jonah, Raffaela and Santangelo, Hannah and Jude, Teresa and her cadet (whose name we know not), even Webb and Tate. I am inspired, seriously. How Phenomenal can one book be?This book is asking:  DON'T YOU KNOW?  Love and Hope can spring from the most unlikely places.

Why did I read this just now? I bought my copy a long time ago upon recommendation of people I thought my friends. If said people are real friends, they wouldn’t just recommend it, they should have tied me in a chair and forced me to read this. I reckon they don’t have to tie me in that chair too long because it only took a couple of pages before I fell in love with this amazing book. I frequently tell people that if only I could I would marry Paper Towns, but that has changed now. Paper Towns would be better off with Jellicoe Road and they will make wonderful, wonderful babies together. I should stop being a smartypants now and get on with it already. I want to bottle this moment, this feeling I have after reading Jellicoe Road and what better way to do that than writing about it?For the first time since I started blogging, I won’t try to write my own summary of the book I’m reviewing. I simply cannot do it. The summary at the back tells us that it is a story about a girl named Taylor Markham, five teenagers in the past, and a road where it all happened. But there’s more to this book than that. Although we spend more than half of the time inside Taylor’s head, Jellicoe Road is a lot bigger than Taylor’s search for some sense of home and security. As the synopsis suggest, it is also about those five teenagers — Narnie, Web, Tate, Fitz and Jude — bonded by a freak accident that happened 22 years in the past. It’s a story of how their friendship help one another withstand the despair that is eating them. It’s also about Jonah Griggs, a boy who is scarred for life and the story of how he was saved from self-destruction. It is also about Rafaella and Santagello’s friendship and missed opportunities; and of Jessa’s wild innocence; and of Ben’s music and loyalty. Jellicoe Road is a book that is filled to the brim with genuinely sympathetic and nuanced characters. All of them are dear to me. I desired nothing but to step into the book and give each a hug — a hug that is not much of me comforting them but them reassuring me that they are going to be okay. I wanted to belong. Long to be. It’s a beautiful tale about loss, grief, and pain and at the same time of love, friendship and hope. I am in awe at how Ms. Melina Marchetta managed to do all this under 330 pages.I know a lot of people say that the first half of the book was like a puzzle and way too confusing for its own good. Don’t get intimidated by that. There were tell-tale hints about how the two narratives come together, and I figured out in ways more than one the connection early on the story. I don’t mean to gloat. What I mean is that it is not rocket science and it is still well within the capabilities of an ordinary human mind. I figured it out and I don’t know how to tell you how that’s necessarily a bad thing. I knew it and I felt that Taylor also knew it and only seeks for confirmation — waiting for someone to tell us that it’s all real. Somehow that knowing makes the journey more painful and more lovely.There were laughters shared and tears shed on the Jellicoe Road. There were mistakes made and forgiveness given. There was acceptance. There were tragedies and love stories. There were dreams shattered and dreams built. There was hope. I am thankful to Melina Marchetta for the opportunity to be part of those. I cannot think of better way to end this other than quoting a passage that perfectly summarizes everything I feel towards the book:",24,default,"['2011-read', 'favorites', 'contemporary-ya']"

One of the busiest months I ever had where I’d become a walking robot because of the workloads I had. I was eager to read this book because most of my bookish friends raved about it, and I’m glad I was able to start reading with this book. I remember asking, “What is waiting for me ahead of this story?”, and they said, “Rollie, my friend, when you go there, you’ll see,” and that was the last phrase I want to hear from them.Yes, I was eager to read this book not just because I required myself to read this, for this is our Book Club’s book of the month, but because this book was scheduled to be read in February this year. Since this book won the poll to be our book for this month—May—I really waited for the right time to come for me to read this book.Confusing? I agree. The first half of the book was supplemented with consistent clueless information that readers couldn’t make out the sense. I believe to what they said that the whole story is as if a jigsaw puzzle. Looking at it at the very first place, you’ll get confused. As the story goes on, the pattern to get the puzzle whole is gradually revealing. I liked how the italic letters affect how I visualized the situations presented. Further, I admire the author at how the manuscript written in a way that it differs a lot to the other narration. The moods of two narrations are way different that they both clung to their respective generations. I liked also how Marchetta becomes picky of words and finicky of sentence constructions in order for her to present well the emotion she intended. To say I cried is an overstatement. I was just saddened at how the past story ended up. I accidentally attached myself to the friendship since I could relate the situation. The difference was just I consider their friendship perfect and filled with love. The group wasn’t just a circle of friends but it became their own home. The group has become their own family. Sad to realize is that they were created through accident, yet they were destroyed through accident. I couldn’t help but hope for Taylor to have a father alive since there was no concrete confirmation of what happened until the epilogue justified. If there’s a scene I loved the most, it’s the last—epilogue. In that scene, I saw a picture of love, happiness, dream and fulfillment. Right in that moment when he saw Fitz innocence occurred, tragic it appealed but pure happiness was underneath.If there’s one person I empathized the most, it’s Hermit. I could see the weight of his burden since the accident. I could feel his guilt that he wasn’t able to control it up. I could understand his hunger for forgiveness from the dead who wouldn’t give it to him already. I feel empathy for him for spending a very happy day with Taylor and end his self with a gun just as he thought his burden was gone.If there’s one thing I didn’t like much about this book, it’s how the Taylor’s story became dull. The revelations of the past outshine the present’s story. I even can’t believe she’s the daughter of two amazing people in Narnie’s manuscript. I believe that the present-time narrative was just an instrument and the past’s was the real underscore. Yet I’m happy that in a way I made the journey with story along Jellicoe Road.",24,default,[]

Jellicoe Road, the prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.
The place is dark and I can't nearly see everything that surrounds me. With a lampshade sitting on my side and a long pillow sleeping in the other, this is the night that will fulfill my dream, my dream to visit the well-known Jellicoe Road. The prettiest among the roads without walking, just a simple stare and a very long read. Silence. I can hear the laughs of the children and the memories, ready to burst in a second, written in the cold stones for years. The history is ready and the skirmish, begin!Jellicoe Road, written by an Asutralian author Melina Marchetta, is my first book from her best and well-known works for years. It was a pity that I never touched her books in the past and somebody should pull me around and feed me her book just to read it, and it was great! I can't believe it, reading Melina Marchetta is an exciting new experience. Something everyone will enjoy or not, somehow the target of the book is straight to your heart.I would like to thank Aaron for sharing this book with everyone and to his great F2F discussion last Saturday (May 20, 2012). The laser tag was fun and I would like to give another round but my breath is chocking me in my neck but in the end, I did not make it. I would like to discuss the book with others but in the simplest way, I write a review for everyone to understand why I gave this book three stars and also thanks to Jzhun for sharing his insights but the night left me hang forever.
[image error]The TFG (The Filipino Group) peeps were running away from zombies inside a dark neon-colored room with laser guns to kill those fuck up creatures. Kidding. The peeps were just having fun tagging each other and the winner is, ugh, the Red team (not my team). Guys, we'll do better next time! Aja!Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother when she was eleven years old and when she was fourteen, she tried to escape the boarding school to search for her mom in Sydney, but the attempt was failed and met the guy of her life. At seventeen, she was pointed as the head of the underground community; she will lead her team to an annual territory game with the Cadets and the Townies. But when she is in need of someone in her life, Hannah (her guardian) was lost and the clues left behind will lead her to the history of the skirmish game and will change her future forever.When I first read the first chapter of the book, which is a very long introduction besides the very short heartwarming prologue, I was so confused that I wanted to put the book down from my hand but my instinct keep me from reading it or maybe I was so frightened not to finish the book on time. The first chapter will first lead you to Taylor assigned as the leader of the underground community in in the boarding school to lead the territory war among the Townies, Cadets and them. Because Marchetta only spilled small amount of facts regarding the territory war or the skirmish and the school terminologies because I'm not used to Australian educational system, the readers will find it a bit confusing, no, very confusing, that in fact few of the TFGs in the past who attempted to read it put it down as early as Marchetta will spill the bucket of facts in the middle of the book. Well, only the courageous one can finish Jellicoe Road and will wash himself from Marchetta's magnum revelations.The manuscript, which is another story of a group of friends in the old town and written by Hannah, Taylor's guardian, was another cool element of the story and a friend of mine, Aaron, site it as the ""dual narrative"" (a good blog post from Guy Gone Geek about The Duality of a Narrative.) Dual narrative is another effective technique to show the story of two different characters, places or period and usually tell the story in two different perspectives. The Manuscript gone mad and it was the mystery in the two point of views that made me connect the dots from the first page to the last. Well, it was predictable and I find it a little bit disappointing; because I want the mystery will not reveal itself until the epilogue of the book or maybe I expected a lot from Marchetta. Maybe some, the dual narrative may find it a work of another genius, for me, it's just another technique that other authors mastered.Lately, I have this close connection between the main characters of the books I read. And I hate the most about Taylor is when she whine because her life sucks! Yeah, there are those when she keeps on whining and repeating her problems from her head and blame others of putting her into that state. From that, she pointed out other characters as that and other these to confuse readers. Unfortunately, in my case, I'm not and I stuck to my own idea of who was that and who were these. This kind of character might be an effective one, but this kind of character annoys me a lot or maybe her hormones should be blame here. The capital S part is quiet disappointing, it's too short to be good like they are just doing it because of heat, maybe. There is no love that night but purely physical. I love her, because she acted like a strong mother to others.But what I love most in the book is the setting of the story. Was it real or not? I'm just a curious lad who really wanted to visit Jellicoe Road. Whether fictional or not, the setting of the book made me jump with over excitement that I though I'm walking into the forest, where branches are lying to each other making a canopy. It's like heaven on Earth, a shangri-la itself! I missed my place, I lived in a small town before and those branches, well, they really exist and the view, well, it's another real issue. Other than that, I also manage to observe that each ending of each chapter had a heartwarming touch of sadness. It's a good motive to continue my reading, I feel solace.Reading Jellicoe Road, well, it was like how the Sydney Morning Herald said:
""Melina Marchetta has a knack for writing stories that swallow you up and refuse to let you go until you've read every last word.""You don't have to pick most of the positive sides of the book, it's just that the book already push you into reading even not liking it as much as your friends does and not knowing the possible reasons why.
[image error]I love those cookies! Who baked those? I think I ate the Hermit's place. It was amazing anyway, even though it smelled swampy with grassy texture (I think I read swamp next to the Hermit's name). By the way, Taylor (DC) or maybe Jessa, what are you doing there? I can't even enumerate those Houses except Darlings.I read the book slowly so that I can answer the discussion's questions and because of my hope to attend the discussion early, I was so disappointed that I'm late, no, I missed the whole discussion. Overall, I like the Jellicoe Road and I will always treasure it even I find other Marchetta's works better. This will always reminds me of you, the wicked in the outside but nice in the inside. It's like exchanging those songs but I use books to describe you and super thanks for sharing such nice song for me. Mabuhay!

How does she present a selfish teen who is special, popular, and loved and not make me dislike her? I think this is what Special Topics in Calamity Physics tried to be but failed for me. I think. I'm not good at the literary but YA provides steps instead of a sheer cliff face so it slowly guides me to something, something I can believe without losing me. Marchetta is terrific at this. The stories of two groups of friends, 22 years apart, are interwoven. The setting is at a boarding school, I think open to all and including gifted but troubled orphans. There's connection between the groups and mysteries. I love the humor and I can see Marchetta has this one gag she keeps using, but I'm easy so it works on me every time.Here's where I go off-track. My parents didn't pack me off to summer camps to build character, learn crafts, experience, get rid of me, or whatever reasons people have. The one time I had to go, I was 19 and forced to accompany a 14 year old Korean 2nd cousin who didn't speak much English. Her parents thought an American summer camp would make her practice language skills and build character and experience. I resented her hugely, packed away with her and bunch of 8 to 13 year olds for about 2 weeks. I was even older than the counselors, who ranged from 15 to 17. I don't recall a single adult although they were in nearby cabins. I hadn't camped much so I didn't pack the right clothes or, uh, lady supplies. I was at the height of my nerdy, sweaty, uncomfortable-with-everything, acne-covered, big-t-shirts-with-animals-wearing, big-'90's-glasses, boys-are-scary, I-just-wanna-read phase. It was a terrible, terrible, terrible camp for both of us.But as I read this book, I remember this one awful and lonely time, when I realized that she and I were in the same boat and stopped hating her (so much). There was one evening, after dinner, we were sitting outside during a free hour, and my poor 2nd cousin was sitting apart, unable to participate in the swift and slangy chatter. I was sitting next to her and I nudged her when the others began clumping up for what was obviously turning into one of those bonding conversations. She yanked herself away and glared at me, and unable to suppress it after about a week of tolerating my situation for her sake, I snapped back at her. Oh man. I regretted it immediately but was confused by the mix of anger and shame, unable to choose which one to go with. We sat in silence for a few minutes. The sun was beginning its slow set through the trees and casting long shadows on the slopes where we were sitting after dinner and the girls in our cabin gathered around the 2 female counselors to ask about boys and ""going down"" (because camp is apparently where you learn all these things) and shrieking as one of the counselors held up a crooked pinky and considered it with narrowed eyes that denoted a real attempt to recall, and I should end this run on. I remember envying those 8-13yos, and the counselors who had started out as young campers only to return year after year. They laughed, played, fought, made up, made friends...they were golden. They belonged. I remember laughing a little at the pinky, hiding my horror that the 14yo counselor had experience in these things and I did not. My poor, reviled 2nd cousin turned to me and offered a broken English apology, with eye contact even. Ouch. It struck me that we belonged together, as those golden campers belonged together.Damn you, and thank you, Marchetta, for making me remember that.",23,default,"['babble-added', 'ah-ree-ell']"

This was my first Melina Marchetta book, and it’s still my favorite. The beginning was a muddle to be honest, but by the book’s end you forgive it that one fault.

An amazingly beautiful story! This story is about Taylor Markham, seventeen-year old boarding-school student of the The Jellicoe School. I’m having such a hard time putting this review into words because nothing will do it justice. I think I’m just left to gush. This is one of my all-time favorite books! Melina Marchetta has a way of writing that is so profound without being wordy or pretentious. She sucks you into the character making you feel you are taking this journey of discovery right along with Taylor. Melina brilliantly reveals the mystery behind all these broken people, gradually, and you are riveted as you read along. Some of this story is shocking and heart-breaking but other parts are hysterically funny and very sweet. The romance between Taylor and Jonah *sigh* is amazing (I think I’m going to say amazing far too many times in this review, sorry!), heart-warming, tender, and sweet!In the beginning of the story, Taylor doesn’t want to let anyone in but you see her growth through the novel, and how she starts to rely on other people as well, to give her love and strength. This is such an emotional story, in a good way. I was crying, laughing, and then crying again, both happy and sad tears! With that said, this was not a depressing book at all but more of a life affirming story. It’s definitely a story I will be reading again and again! Like I said, amazing!Here are some of my favorite quotes/parts: He stops and looks at me. “I’m here because of you. You’re my priority. Your happiness, in some f**ked up way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime.” ”If you weren’t driving, I’d kiss you senseless,” I tell him. He swerves to the side of the road and stops the car abruptly. “Not driving any more.”“So are you going to tell your mother about me?” I shrug. “I’ll probably mention that I’m in love with you.” He chuckles. “Only you would say that in such a I-think-I’ll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.”“Strange that you’re hanging out with Santangelo,” I say. “Strange? I don’t think that word comes anywhere near it. I had to sleep at the Santangelo penitentiary for pre-pubescent girls. There are hundreds of them, including that annoying pest that belongs to you. I have one brother and I live with four hundred guys. Girls under the age of fourteen are the most frightening creatures I have ever come across. They all insist on running around the house in their underwear.”“No,"" I say, looking up at Griggs. ""It's actually because my heart belongs to someone else."" And if I could bottle the look on his face, I'd keep it by my bedside for the rest of my life.”“Santangelo is irritated. ""We're not supposed to be collaborating. It's supposed to be a war and you're supposed to stick to the boundaries."" ""We've seen you in your jocks,"" she reminds him. ""Taylor and Griggs have pashed.

To be honest, I spent the majority of this book thinking, ""this is a good book, but it's not that good"" because I knew exactly what was going on. The ""mystery"" was never a mystery for me but I kept reading, waiting patiently for this book to blow me away--because I knew it would, eventually, based on all the four and five-star reviews given by trusted Goodreaders (namely Reviewer X, Tatiana and April). And, yeah, now that I've finished reading Jellicoe Road I can say this book has 'it'. That thing that so few YA books tend to have these days. I don't even know what 'it' is, exactly. But I'll tell you this for free: my cry-holes got leaky during the last fifty pages or so. Yeah, you read that right. I. Cried. And the author didn't have to stoop to throwing some insane manipulative twist at me. She's just that good at writing. Her story came together beautifully for me and I am thoroughly satisfied. This book deserves all sorts of awards.I will say that I spent the first fifty pages or so wondering what the hell was going on because I was dumb enough to assume the prologue was from the main character's POV. Then I looked back and saw that the incident that happened in the prologue happened twenty-two years before chapter one. Our main character is seventeen years old. So, yeah--not the same person. Just keep that in mind when you pick this book up. Also, you might want to write down the names of the characters mentioned in Hannah's manuscript--who's related to who and whatnot. It makes it much easier to keep track of the story within the story.Anyway, I love this book. I'm going to start recommending it to anyone who asks. Soooo...read this book. Now. P.S.

I told her mine was Stolen and she told me this was hers, so I decided to read it. When something means a lot to my friends I try it out. The book is a puzzle from page one. There are two stories and you need to know how they go together and if they even do. that's what kept me reading. While the main beginning of the book was quite uninteresting, once I passed 50 pages and the story started, the beginning made complete sense. As slow as the beginning is, the book wouldn't be the same without it. The writing in the book is beyond beautiful, there is no way to really describe it. The book is so vividly etched into my mind, even though there isn't actually much imagery or anything. She focuses on story and character and it pays off. The characters are perfect. Written to be flawed and mysterious and heartbreaking and they all have so much character development that at the end you feel like you've grown with them. I have so much to say about this book, none of it coherent or useful, so I'm going to end this here by saying that I recommend this book to everyone and anyone.

I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there you'll understand,""

To be honest, I struggled with this story in the beginning - I didn't know what was going on. But as things started to come together, the story that Melina Marchetta crafted is simply beautiful. Jellicoe Road is one of those stories that I will always remember, like an old memory you look back on with a smile. I will think of the boy in the tree and the boy who stole a bike and saved the lives of three people. I will reflect back upon this story and feel something deep within my bones that I cannot explain, but mostly I will be grateful that I took the time to read their story.",21,default,"['young-adult', 'all-time-favorites']"

This book made me feel: All the emotions.Jellicoe Road was my first Marchetta novel - though this is an author highly touted and often recommended, I was strangely hesitant to read any of her books. Example? I bought Marchetta's acclaimed ya fantasy Finnikin of the Rock for Nook over two months ago, when it was on sale for $2.99, and haven't yet peeked at a page. Hype is often a double-edged sword, as many other anticipated YA novels can attest and I didn't want to feel the sting of disappointment here. I have to say that the first 50 pages of Jellicoe certainly intriiigued me, but they didn't quite convince me as I had hoped. I can certainly see why some readers find the beginning off-putting and hard to comprehend initially, but even after the dual narrative of past and present were cleared up, I just didn't get It, the Big Deal about this book and this author. Then, near about 100 pages later and a ""save yourself, Taylor,"" I got it in a big way. This book made me Feel Things. All of the feelings really: happiness, amusement, sorrow, anger, fear, love. I'm stuck with the feeling that no matter how much I edit and revise and rethink, I will never be able to do this beautiful novel justice. As soon as I finished this, I knew I didn't want to think about other characters, other stories. I wanted to stay here, in Jellicoe, with these characters. So I did the only thing that made sense and flipped the book over and immediately began rereading all my favorite parts. It still packs a punch the second time around, even knowing explicitly what will happen.I grabbed this on a whim three days ago, having been close to finishing the excruciatingly emotional Code Name Verity but with 100 pages and hours of work to go, I opted for a longer novel that hopefully wouldn't make me cry at work. How wrong I was; tears were streaming down by my lunch break (aka p. 255) I engulfed this absorbing, heart-breaking tale in just over twelve hours, covering work and family dinner, starting just before I left at 9 am, sneaking in pages whenever - wherever - I could. Melina Marchetta is the real deal: an imitable and simple but striking style, a masterful storyteller with impressive authorial sleight-of-hand, capable of rendering complex, fallible and damaged characters I still wholly and completely loved. This novel is a masterpiece of young-adult fiction (the 'territory war' was obviously the weakest part of the novel, but it brought together the core four [Taylor, Santangelo, Raffaela, Griggs] initially and eventually was revealed to have a larger purpose) and Melina Marchetta deserves all the accolades she's garnered. As the lovely Emily May so aptly put it: ""[She] plays my emotions like Jimi Hendrix played guitar."" Skillfully, elegantly, and above all subtly, Marchetta takes utmost time and care with crafting both her storylines and her compellingly damaged and so so real characters.And let me tell you: oh boy, did I ever care about Taylor, Jonah, Jude, Hannah, Tate, Jessa, Webb, etc. While it took a while for these many personalities to manifest, I think this might one of my most beloved ensembles. From Jonah to Jude, these characters are real, vibrant, and dear to me. Jonah Griggs: I officially Get It. I officially Want One of My Own. Everyone take note for in Jellicoe Road, with Melina's hand at the wheel, there is an authentic, believable and touching YA romance with a swoon-worthy broody love-interest. I don't go in for broody as much now that I'm not 17 and I certainly don't say ""swoon-worthy"" as a descriptor for men I like, but Jonah Griggs defies that. He is broody and swoon-worthy, but that's not all he is. Like Taylor and Jude (Oh, Jude <3. I think he broke my heart as much as Griggs did.) this damaged young-man is developed and rounded. The scenes between him and Taylor - fighting, teasing, loving - all have electricity, a palpable tension, and their relationship is one of the few credible romances in YA. Jellicoe Road is moving, powerful and dramatic without being emotionally manipulative - when Taylor lashes out at whoever is convenient (not my Griggs!), I feel for her wild pain instead of rolling my eyes at her melodrama. Most of the characters have significant tragedies in their pasts, especially Taylor and Jonah, but this is an author that appreciates retraint and how to show emotion without overdoing it and making it a Production. I finished this novel nothing if not in awe of the talent shown throughout from the author - from plot development to character reveals, this is one of the best.Before, I was scared to read Marchetta because I feared she/the novel wouldn't live up to expectations. Now I just don't know where to start - I've ordered hardback copies of Finnikin, its sequel Froi of the Exiles, and Saving Francesca. I just can't do this novel justice - whatever I say feels inadequate. This book moved me, like The Book Thief did - at my core, in a place few novels and characters truly reach. I said before that Melina Marchetta could have been a victim of the hype machine but now all I want to do is force all my family and friends to read her novels. I've decided that the hype around this author and this book isn't big enough yet - everyone should be reading this author. Jellicoe Road is a gripping read, one that inspired a wide, fully-felt spectrum of emotions and reactions - all of them complimentary. I love this book like I love few others.My reactions by page, because by 250 I couldn't think critically, I could just fangirl absorb the words as fast as my eyes would move and jot down impressions/thoughts: p. 250: Oh my god. I <3 Jonah p. 255: WTF! NO! What! Yass! p. 297: I want a Griggs. p. 304: This is heart-breaking, gut-wrenching and still so lovely. This book... ""Who will be my memory"" I can't.... this book... p. 315: Could he be any more adorable? p. 343: And THAT, ladies and gents, is how you write a credible, romantic teenage relationship. p. 371: oh no oh no oh no I think I know where this is headed oh no p. 394: damn right you better keep Raffy around - the rare female sidekick that is fully developed and awesome p. 399 and on: tears p. 407: Griggs. p. 416: I love the narrative structure, the symmetry.

Even more powerful the second time around.***Merely thinking about Jellicoe Road makes my thoughts scatter and unorganized, so in order to convey my thoughts effectively, I must make a list. Hopefully I’ll give Jellicoe Road at least a fraction of the praise it deserves.7 Reasons to Read Jellicoe Road:1- 
The Writing.
 Enticing, captivating, and dripping with emotion. That’s all I can say. 
“My body becomes a raft and there's this part of me that wants just literally to go with the flow. To close my eyes and let it take me. But I know sooner or later I will have to get out, that I need to feel the earth beneath my feet, between my toes - the splinters, the bindi-eyes, the burning sensation of hot dirt, the sting of cuts, the twigs, the bites, the heat, the discomfort, the everything. I need desperately to feel it all, so when something wonderful happens, the contrast will be so massive that I will bottle the impact and keep it for the rest of my life.”
2- 
The Mystery.
I’m pretty sure everyone was confused for the first third of the book. I am no exception to that. I did get frustrated; I was feeling a bit impatient. I didn’t appreciate the genius behind the slowly unraveling storyline until I had finished the book. In the end, it all came together, and for the element of mystery Marchetta used, I am grateful.
“Whatever is now covered up will be uncovered and every secret will be made known.” 
3- 
The love, the pain, the hope, and everything in between.
 What I find most incredible about Jellicoe Road? Even through all the hardships, all the pain they were forced to endure, a small wisp of emotion was sneaking out of the pages, resonating: hope. 4- 
 You will fall in love with each and every character.
 Days after finishing the book, I still tear up thinking about the masterfully well-written characters. The characterization is so superb, near flawless, to the point where you feel like have known the characters for your whole life. That is the impact her characters have on me. 5- 
 Jellicoe Road will affect your life, whether you’re a teen or not.
 This book has some powerful messages about friendships and relationships. It will not only affect the lives of adolescents, but also the lives of adults. It will open your eyes.
 “It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”
 6- 
TAYLOR AND JONAH.
 I don’t recall ever being as enamored as I am with Taylor and Jonah with any other fictional couple. And you know what? They don’t have the healthiest relationship. It is realistically flawed. No matter what they did to each other, no matter what they said, their love was ubiquitous. I don’t care how cheesy that sounds.
“I shrug. ""I'll probably mention that I'm in love with you.""He chuckles. ""Only you would say that in such a I-think-I'll-wash-my-hair-tonight tone.”
7- 
Jellicoe Road expertly chronicles the journey that is known as adolescence.
 I’ll get this out of the way: being a teen sucks. I would know, as I am at that stage of my life currently. As a result, this book had a massive impact on me. I could relate to everything Taylor thought and said. Her internal monologues were at times hilarious, and at others, made me choke up in tears from her truthfulness. How Marchetta captures the voice of a teen authentically and effortlessly will never cease to amaze me. Seriously, this book should be required reading for ALL teens. Melina Marchetta, you have officially converted me. Prior to reading Jellicoe Road, I could care less about realistic fiction. I was more of a fantasy type of gal. Now, after being exposed to this masterpiece, my eyes have been opened.Reading through my favorite quotes is making me nostalgic.

First time reading review
Good gracious. I'm in love with this book. Literally. Reading this was like riding a roller coaster. Too many emotions in one sitting. I just find myself rooting for Taylor to find her mother and Hannah and all about the Fucked-Up Five's (just quoting Fitz and Jude's words) story.I'm impressed that the author didn't bore me with the manuscripts. She only write them once, I suppose, in every other chapter and didn't take any more than two pages. But as the story progresses, I find myself drawn to the 'Fucked-Up Five'. Especially to Webb. I personally adore Taylor. She's fierce and sweet at the same time. She's everything I want in a herione. Griggs dear is.. well.. Griggs. Short-tempered. Sweet. Santangelo was my first crush in this story. *giggles* But he's better off with Raffy. And there's Jessa, the young and full of energy girl. With a scarced past. And then the band composed of Ben, Choi and the Mullets brothers is definitely a win.Romance. It's all in the air but it never diverts the story from us. It's basically intertwined with the story.I'm left speechless after reading the last sentence because the author, in some freaking way only I seemed to decode, assured me that from that day onwards, everything will be okay. Not everything eveything. Just ... everything.5 stars. Definitely a must-read.I laughed out loud at this part.I look at him, shaking my head.""No chance. It'd be like cutting off our hands.""""Then learn to live without your hands.""""No, because then we won't be able to do this,"" Ben says, giving him the finger.You're the man, Ben!And, of course, nobody can't not laugh at the Cadets first attempt of invading Jellicoe School's territory. Hahahaha. Taylor's definitely a genius. 0And I'm utterly charmed at this part.""I'm here because of you. You're my priority. Your hapiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don't think that will be happening in my lifetime.""I've read and liked Saving Francesca but Jellicoe Road deinitely one-upped it.

Using a sentence from the book that sums up this story, for me: ""I remember love."" Too simple? It's powerful, multi-faceted and complex, actually, just like love... and life... is. I was swept away on the journey with Taylor and the others, and I cried for what they lost and found. In the end, out of the tragedies and hardships of life, I was left with a feeling of love, hope and wonder, that I, along with the characters, discovered... on the Jellicoe Road. LOVED it! Granted, it was a bit confusing in the beginning, with the story shifting between a different cast of characters, at different times. But then, the pieces started falling into place and once I reached the end, I just thought, with tears in my eyes and my heart overflowing: ""What an amazing story!"" I won't go into the plot as this is a story that one just has to discover in all its layers and complexities as it unfolds. Melina Marchetta, an Aussie author and former teacher, is one of my favourite YA authors. Her characters feel so real and the emotions she portrays are so genuine and raw that her books are all special to me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and totally deserving of all the YA literature awards it won, in my humble opinion!
On the Jellicoe Road
 has one of the most powerful (and tragic) openings I have ever read:""My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn’t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead – just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, “Didn’t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?”Did I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they’re some kind of garbage, don’t you know?Wonder dies.""*sniffles*Favourite quotes (Non-Spoiler):""When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey.

On my ""all time favorites"" lies ""On the Jellicoe Road"" by Melina Marchetta, because her style is amazing and the way she drafted this story was unbelievable, simply bleowing me away. Her storytelling is lyrical, genuine and clean, with a very different approach VS the other authors I've encountered so far. Taylor Markham, 17, lives on the Jellicoe Road, in a boarding school. She was abandoned 6 years ago by her mom and found in a restaurant by Hannah, who took her in. They became best friends and she was the only person in front of whom Taylor could be herself, without fears or concerns. When Hannah abruptly disappears, she is extremely worried and goes in search for her. This is basically the main plot, but besides that we also have ""mini"" ones like the territory battles between the kids from Taylor's institution or the love story between her and Jonah, the leader of one of the rival teams, a very lovable character, that will spice up the story. The focus is not very much on the love story, the reader has to be aware of the initiation journey that will make the characters more mature.  I don't know where to begin with the parts I loved. Firstly, the characters are amazing and extremely complex, because they just seem to get better and better as the story progresses. Taylor is something else, because even of her background, she grew up extremely well. As expected, she is complex and difficult to figure out, because after being abandoned, she is guarded and cautious. She is very determined, with a specific sense of humor, very ironic, but smart and witty. Taylor is the leader of the kids from the Jellicoe institution, but she is not in her element, because she doesn't want to stand out, to be noticed. She likes to live quietly, in her own world, but the circumstances will force her to be brave, to go out of her comfort zone and go in search for Hannh, because she needs her friend back. Second, Melina's style is nothing like I've ever read, such a lyrical book, beautifully told and not easy to read. All the elements from the book are tied together and every connection made is sooooo smart, so well blended. There are 2 perspectives, past and present, that until the end of the book will go full circle and the reader will put all the pieces together and see how well they click. Last, but not least, what the reader goes through while reading the book is not easy, but extremely special. The action is very realistic for a fictional read, but so level headed and raw. Melina ""played"" with a lot of themes, like love, love for your close ones, family, colleagues, friends, for yourself! She also focuses on more uglier things like murders, abuse, disappearances, accidents, that open your eyes and shows you the cruel reality. I repeat, even if the story is fictional, the feelings are real and make you so aware of your surroundings and reality you live in. Don't open this book if you believe the action and plot will be sugar coated, but I guarantee you will not regret it, because the message is so strong, you won't forget it so easily.  I gladly recommend ""On the Jellicoe Road"" because this is not your typical YA book. The characters, the plot and everything in between are special and different. Dive in the story open minded and just open your heart to this amazing characters that won my heart irrevocably. 5 stars!",20,default,"['favorites', 'something-new', 'young-adult', 'terribly-sad']"

I should have at least picked up one Australian novel in my first year of book-reading addiction, yet it took me five years to finally do so. Essentially, I ought to have by now given that I'm Australian. Yeah, it's strange that I haven't read many or any.Okay, now the actual review. ""It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La.""On the Jellicoe road is about Taylor Lily Markham, who at the age of 11 was abandoned by her mother at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe road. Her only memory of her previous life is standing on her father’s shoulder. Hannah is her only guardian who lives in the unfinished house by the river, and writes stories about five kids who lived there back in the 1980s. Taylor is a part of territory war between the cadets (Sydney boys who come for training every six weeks a year) and the townies (kids from Jellicoe town).The beginning was faintly confusing, but after 100 pages I finally put some of the pieces together. I won’t go into the minor confusion I had experienced in the book, because I believe on the Jellicoe road should be read without much information of the backstory. It will take some time until you start understanding what’s going on, nonetheless you will have an enjoyable time attempting to solve the mystery as you’re reading, right before you start crying at the end. After 200 pages the book does become immensely predictable, however it wasn’t any less entertaining. I’m not certain if I liked Taylor. At times I despised her, and felt her i-don’t-give-a-shit attitude should not simply be excused considering her tough past. At the end I worked out my conflicted feelings with Taylor and saw her in a more of a positive light. The love interest - Jonah Griggs is the leader of the cadets, and is viewed frequently as the ‘dark and tortured’ type. Taylor and Jonah have this heartbreaking and complicated history. There was no insta-love or drooling over each other like crazy in their relationship, thankfully. Anyway, I gladly recommend this book to everyone.

What a gem of a book!It's a very emotional story and at times painful to read because you see these characters that are good people make horrible decisions and become so lost that they don't even know who they are anymore. It's a story about loss, lonliness, death and guilt and all you wish for is that the characters get the happy ending they deserve.Melina Marchetta's writing is superb; she uses metaphors and similes in a way that is never jarring and really creates atmosphere. After reading On the Jellicoe Road I immidiatly want to pick up Marchetta's other books because this novel has instilled a kind of trust in me. I feel like I would love whatever she writes. The way she deals with such serious topics and still manages to make me laugh with her dry humour and sarcasm is fantastic. I loved the characters in this story. Taylor, our protagonist, is a 17-year-old girl who has been abandoned by her mother at the age of eleven. Since then, she hasn't seen her mother or father and feels like she can't trust anyone and that nobody in the world loves her. I feel like characters such as Taylor are very difficult to write because they can be very moody, depressed and even mean at times and yet they still have to be lovable. Melina Marchetta did a great job with this, I really empathized with Taylor and her witty remarks just added another layer to the story. I also loved Rafi and Ben, Taylor's best friends and completely fell in love with Jonah. This book really is full of complex, likeable characters. The reason I took away half a star was because the novel was quite confusing at times. Particularly at the beginning, it took me a while to understand what was going on, who these characters were, what was past and what was present. Getting through these first pages totally paid off though.I highly recommend this novel to anyone who likes contemporary. I also feel like you would really enjoy it if you liked I'll Give You the Sun. The story concepts are somewhat similar and it deals with comparable topics, even though the writing is very different.",19,default,"['young-adult', 'contemporary', 'listened-on-audio', 'best-reads-of-2015']"

If you’re lucky, you will experience these encounters more than once.I was lucky. I read JELLICOE ROAD. This extraordinary book changed my life, and maybe it will change yours, too.To tell the truth, JELLICOE ROAD kind of ruins you temporarily for all other books. For several days after I finished this book, I wandered around in a daze. I picked up books, halfheartedly read the first few pages, then put them down and wandered away. Nothing seemed to match the magical dream-come-true that was genius author Melina Marchetta’s third novel.It starts out confusingly. What’s going on? Why is there so much tension between all these people? Who are they, anyway? What do they want? Why are they so serious about their situation? But then, invariably, you’ll get sucked in. It’s probably a little like how the average person might fall in love: you can’t pinpoint exactly when someone became special to you, all you can say is that it happened, and you can’t even remember back to a time when they weren’t special to you.The narration and plot progression of the book reads like a dream: choppy and distracted in a whimsical manner. Don’t expect a conventional story arc, or you’ll probably get really frustrated. Best if you just let it happen as it does. JELLICOE ROAD reads like someone laughing through tears. I couldn’t help but smile as Taylor, Jonah, and the others endeared themselves to me even before I could figure out what was going on between them all, even as their painful discoveries about their tragic pasts tugged at my heartstrings.A story this magnificent, this heartbreaking, shouldn’t have this much hope…but it does. That’s the beauty of this book. Melina Marchetta has written a book that is so much more than a simple story in words: it takes on a life of its own.

I was in year 9 of high school and I had just discovered the joy that is reading. I had devoured Melina Marchetta’s Looking for Alibrandi — which I deeply related to, being Italian-Australian — and then Saving Francesca. By the time I had picked up On the Jellicoe Road, Marchetta had only published three books, and I was determined to read all of them because I adored her writing.I’m not exaggerating when I say On the Jellicoe Road changed my life. At the young age of 14, I had not yet read a book that affected me on a deep personal level because I had not yet read a wide-range of novels. That changed when I first laid eyes on On the Jellicoe Road. From the very first page, I knew this would be a special book. On the Jellicoe Road draws you in and fits itself snugly into a corner of your heart. This is a story within a story within a story: it’s about a daughter’s desperate search for her mother, it’s about a sister’s love for her brother, it’s about a boy finding solace after years of torment — it’s about family and friendship, love and heartbreak. It’s about healing, and acknowledging that, even if you don’t believe it right now, you deserve happiness and love, and the world is so lucky to have you. But most of all, it’s about belonging — to a family, a friendship group, a lover — whatever; so long as that person accepts you for who you are.I’m probably making it sound like this book is a dark pit of despair and angst, and while sometimes it can be, it’s also funny and romantic, mysterious and poignant. I cried like a baby during darker scenes and was then laughing a mere page later. I squealed approximately every time Jonah Griggs showed up, and blushed like mad whenever he and Taylor interacted. This book is a whirlwind of divergent emotions — you’ll never know what will hit you and the anticipation is part of its charm.Every character in On the Jecllioe Road is a treasure. I adore them all and you will too, because they’re just so damn relatable. I found pieces of myself in all of them: in Taylor’s stubbornness, in Jonah’s protectiveness, in Raffy’s mother-hen attitudes, in Chaz’s tenacity, and in Jessa’s cheekiness; in Narnie’s steadfastness, in Webb’s joy, in Tate’s love, in Fitz’s liveliness, and in Jude’s vigilance. These incredible, loveable characters are what make the book — they are so real and in your face, it feels like they’re sitting next to you as you read.Taylor, the main character, is probably one of the first characters I’ve ever fallen in love with. At the beginning of the novel, Taylor is deeply depressed and fed up with the world. She has been betrayed multiple times in her life by the people who are supposed to love her unconditionally, and is thoroughly dejected. But she has such a loving heart, even though she tries her hardest to bury her feelings behind a wall of sarcasm and dry wit (she’s actually hilarious), and attempts to keep people who care for her away because she can’t handle being betrayed again.I don’t think I’ve ever spoken about my first crush before, but it was on a book character: specifically, on Jonah Griggs. If you’ve read this book, you’ll know why I love Jonah Griggs so much and if you haven’t read it, you’ll soon find out. He and Taylor have history together, and it’s not the good kind. She feels as though Jonah betrayed her when they were younger, and as a result, there’s so much tension — romantic, hostile tension — between them when they meet again three years later. Jonah is one of the most compelling characters I’ve ever come across; he cares for her so much and I love picking up on his affections throughout the novel, especially the ones Taylor doesn’t notice.If you’re confused for the first 100 pages of the novel, don’t worry, you’re supposed to be. This is not a story that is meant to make sense until you’re close to the end. There are several intriguing mysteries peppered throughout the novel, simmering behind the main plot, that don’t make their presence known until close to the end of the book. It’s a brilliantly clever way of telling a story, and I am so impressed by Marchetta’s ability to keep so much of the mystery a secret from the reader for so long. But once you reach a certain point in the novel, you’ll begin to piece together the clues yourself, even though Taylor, our MC, is unaware of them. That’s when you know you’re reading a bloody good book: when the author can reveal something to the reader without the protagonist knowing. I’ve read this book four times and I’m still picking up on clues at the very beginning of the novel that I wasn’t aware of the first time round.I will remember On the Jellicoe Road for the rest of my life. I love this book with all my heart because it taught me so much, but what sticks with me the most is that, just because I might be damaged, doesn’t mean I’m not worthy of love — any kind of love. You need to read this book to understand. Territory wars, unexpected romance, love, friendship, death, cheesy 80s songs, The Great Escape, and strange dreams all come together to make a flawless novel. I don’t think I’ve ever called a book perfect before, but, oh gosh, On the Jellicoe Road is so damn close.",17,default,"['fave-author', '5-star', 'ultimate-best', 'ya', 'contemporary', 'romance', 're-read']"

This is a truly difficult book to review. Usually I am so excited about reviewing books that I have given 5 stars, and I've been dreading writing this review for some reason. Yes, I did like it a lot. But I just was reading through other 5 star reviews and, I'm not sure I liked it quite as much as most people do. I also see that so many reviewers feel so guilty if they disliked it or had any criticisms of it whatsoever, since it is so widely loved ... and I guess that's sort of how I feel. I really liked it, but I'm not sure if I can say I adored it as so many fellow reviewers seem to. Don't get me wrong. This is a very good book. But it didn't make me cry and I'm not fangirling or drooling over it. I enjoyed it in a rather sane manner, I guess you could say. If you've read other reviews of this book (or, you know, if you've read the book itself), you probably know this already––this book is confusing as heck for at least the first 100 pages. It has two different perspectives––you know, switching between the present and past kind of deal. Well, not that simple, but, I'm not trying to turn everyone's brains into mush here. And then the main character has these dreams/hallucinations about a boy in a tree and it's like ... Okay, is this really happening? Is this a memory? What? Meanwhile, there are a bunch of private school kids having ""territory wars"", and you don't know what the heck that's about either. So on and so forth. For a while, I promise, you will be very puzzled indeed. I figure readers have one of two reactions––to throw the book down in frustration, or to be intrigued and keep reading.Well, it was the latter for me. Although personally, I try never to give up on books at all. But even though this book was frustrating at first, it got a lot better as it went on. And even in the beginning, I was interested even though I was bewildered.What carried this book along for me was Melina Marchetta's writing. She has the type of writing style I wish I had ... and since lately I've been in somewhat of a writing slump, reading this kind of made my blood boil, like, ""WHY CAN'T I WRITE THIS WELL?"" But of course, I couldn't hate the writing because it was so good. Damn it. I also found the structure of the book interesting, how the whole thing is a mystery that gradually unfolds as you watch all the different stories connect. Marchetta sure takes the ""show, don't tell"" rule very seriously. And I'm not sure whether it's a good or a bad thing. I suppose it's both. I mean, showing is one thing ... and thrusting the reader into a story they don't understand is another. At first I felt a bit irritated reading this book because I felt like I was being left in the dark. Marchetta doesn't tell us any backstory. On the other hand, I don't think she exactly had a choice, seeing as the book was more about revealing the story piece by piece. But, oh well. It may be slightly aggravating, but I understand the intentions behind it. Moving on ...The characters ... I don't know. I liked them well enough but I didn't feel like I quite connected with them. I was too distracted trying to figure out what was going on. No, they're not bad characters. I thought they were realistic portrayals of teenagers––how they act, how they talk, how they think, etc. But, I've had stronger connections to characters in other books, which I just did not feel here. So ... just ... ah. I don't know what else to say. This is all very confusing. You may wonder why, then, I'm still giving this book 5 stars. Well, I'm trying to decide whether it's out of guilt. For some reason I would feel bad giving it less, because I understand what Marchetta's intentions were; and I don't think she failed at them, it's just that it took me until the last page to understand them. So I feel like it's more my fault than hers. I also feel like, if I gave this a second read, I would like it a lot more. So I'll have to wait a while and then pick it up again.Sorry, this review is probably utterly nonsensical, and I am just talking to myself now.The point is ... Yes, I recommend this book. Go read it. Think about it for a while, and read it again. And you'll probably like it. ",18,default,"['young-adult', 'yes-yes-yes', 'realistic-fiction']"

4.5 STARS 
There's this little part in the GR book page that enumerates the accolades the book has received and the ones Jellicoe got look too legit to quit (sorry, couldn't help myself). Then you factor in the glowing reviews that ratchets up the expectations from great to impossible to meet. It can't really be THAT good, right?Melina Marchetta will beg to disagree.I'm not going to natter about the first few chapters making no sense because it absolutely didn't. But you won't be left floating in pure confusion, whatever little is revealed in the story will be compelling enough to hold your interest. There's no other way to enjoy this book but to come in blind. Someone asked why Marchetta would tell the story like this. I don't know, maybe because she can? The words were simply elegant and lyrical. You do not mess with talent... this author felt like she slapped me with a bucketload of that.
""I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.""
But unlike most books dealing with angst-ridden issues, this one didn't feel weighed down by it's own plot. It read surprisingly light and funny. I loved all the secondary characters. I loved Jonah Griggs. And Ben (Me? Yes you, Ben). And Raffy. And Heckle and Jeckle. And Fritz. I am foreseeing a re-read in a week or two because finishing this book felt a lot like saying goodbye to friends. 
I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it. ""what are you so sad about?"" Santangelo says to me. ""We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.""
I've only ever cried once or twice over a book, I think, and no, I'm not taking recommendations to shred my heart. I like my hardcore track record as it is, thanks. This one, I thought I've toughed it out well enough. It has been steadily plucking at my heartstrings around the 75% mark (it got me up to throat clearing, no biggie) then this book just yanked at 'em, hard, with (view spoiler)[Taylor finding the tree empty of Fritz and Webb, then waking up begging her mom for just one more day.  (hide spoiler)] and I was a goner.I see this book in everyone's TBR but only 9 have actually read it. QUIT WITH THE PUSSYFOOTING AND THE TOMFOOLERY AND READ THIS.Word of warning:Do NOT read this by yourself, in your car if it's the last 15%.Total emotional annihilation.People will stare at the crazy, crying woman clutching her ipad.",18,default,"['young-adult', 'favorites', 'review', 'foreign-setting', 'heartwarming', 'heartbreaking', '2013-favorites', 'goddamn-onions']"

I can tell this is so hard for him because he won’t look at us. “Sometimes I forget just how bad he was, so all I can remember is that he’s dead because of me. It’s unnatural, what I did. Sometimes I’m thinking about it in the middle of class and I’ll walk out and ring my mum and say, ‘I remember that he took us to the circus, and that we were laughing, so why did I do what I did?’ She always has an answer. ‘And that night he smashed my head against the glass cabinet, Jonah. Do you remember that? And when he burnt your brother with the cigarettes, Jonah?’“Other times I’ll wake her in the middle of the night and say, ‘He told me that no one loved us as much as he did.’ And she’ll say, ‘And then he walked around the house with a gun, threatening to kill us all, because he wanted us to be together forever.’Griggs looks up at us. “What happens when she’s not my memory anymore? What happens when she’s not around to tell me about his belt leaving scars across my two year old brother’s face or when he whacked her so hard that she lost her hearing for a week? Who’ll be my memory?”Santangelo doesn’t miss a beat. “I will. Ring me.”“Same,” Raffy says.To be completely honest, I don’t like reading realistic fiction because it’s always so darned sad and filled with issues that weigh heavily on me. Real life itself is difficult enough to handle. I use fiction as an escape and I don’t want the fiction I read to be chockful of the issues I’m trying to avoid. At least, not unless there are elves and magic involved. It takes a rare book to make me like realistic fiction and Jellicoe Road is one of the few ones that do.There are three other books on that short list of realistic fiction I absolutely adore and all three of them were also written by Marchetta. Telling, huh?Anyway, I’ve been wanting to write about Jellicoe Road for the longest while. I read it and I loved it so much that I didn’t want to analyze it. So I didn’t. Then I read it again and still didn’t feel like writing anything about it. The third time I read it, I loved it even more–it’s not perfect but it gets so darned close to it that I’m just about incoherent. Hah.The story focuses on two groups of friends. One group of friends is in the present time and the other in the past. The relationship the group in the past has to the group in the present is what the story is made of.The story itself focuses on Taylor Markham. Broken, wounded Taylor who lashes out at everything and everyone that will make her soft. Who clings to the one person who doesn’t give her the answers she’s yearning for. Taylor whom adults continue letting down and Taylor who has dreams of a boy in a tree.The boarding school Taylor attends is divided into different houses that are separated by gender. Taylor is the unwilling leader of one of these houses. But she’s not just the leader of the house; she is also the leader of the underground community. Jellicoe School is involved in a territory war with the townies and the cadets who come camping near Jellicoe Road every summer. Places are lost and regained in this war; there is a purple notebook (courtesy of a Chairman Meow) full of relevant (and sometimes irrelevant) rules. No boarding school gets along with a townie and vice versa–and don’t even think about the cadets.Taylor begins the story as prickly as a porcupine–with good reason. She is estranged from her friends Raffy and Ben in the beginning but eventually thaws out and lets them in. She makes friends with the leader of the townies and the son of the town’s mayor and police chief, Chaz Santangelo. Then there’s Jonah Griggs:Jonah Griggs.Not just a name but a state of mind I never want to revisit…Jonah and Taylor have history. And not the romantic kind. I won’t say anymore because you need to experience it for yourself.The book is heavy and deals with dark and important themes like drug, abandonment, parental neglect and at one point, pedophilia. There is a lot of pain and angst and the questions it asks…Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?are ones that will give you pause. But Marchetta’ magic is in the relationships she builds and the ease with which she portrays them. The friendships between the group in the past and the group in the present are flawed and deeply so but are presented with an inherent honesty that gives evidence of their sincerity. You want to believe that friendships like the ones in the book exist and you want to have friends like the ones in the book. The romances in the novel are subplots and while their importance is considerable, at no point do they take over the story. In fact, they are seamlessly woven through the story. This book is a true crossover novel because all the adults present in the novel are just as easy to empathize with and be sympathetic to as the teenagers which just brings home the point: at no point do we ever stop growing.Also, the book is funny. Witness:I lean against the bars that separate us from the others. “So let me get this right,” I say to one of the Townie girls. “All it takes is to insult someone’s mother?”“No,” she explains. “That’s the beauty of it. They don’t actually have to insult. The words Your mother are enough.”“So if I said to you, ‘Your mother is a…?'” I shrug.“Just ‘Your mother.'” But it doesn’t work if girls say it to each other,” she continues. “You have to have a penis for it to affect you in such a way.”What I mean by this so-called review is…read the book.

Seriously, it makes me want to revisit my YA bookshelf and take every book I have down a star because it is just that good. To say that Melina Marchetta has written the quintessential coming of age novel or that she writes of personal growth, family, friends, loyalty and first love simply doesn’t do it justice. I find myself starting and stopping this review so many times, because I’m unable to capture exactly what makes this novel excellent without making it sound corny. You’ll have to see my 5 stars and inept gushing and judge for yourselves what makes Jellicoe Road so brilliant. I recommend this to anyone, not just fans of YA. As others have mentioned the beginning is somewhat confusing. And the focus is rather narrow. In addition, this is another YA novel with a lack of attention to school, homework, and authoritative adults. However, Marchetta’s writing is so beautiful, and the story so powerful that the further you get into the book, the less those things matter.

The first 150 pages of the book are in fact a bit unsettling and confusing. There are different plots going on at the same time, part of it dreams, part reality and part memories from the past but it's difficult to see how they are related till well into the book where finally the story fulfils all of its potential and the plots that apparently made no sense at the beginning converge seamlessly into one beautiful, tragic, poignant story of a girl searching for her roots and her identity no matter what, no matter how brutal the truth may be.

 “And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.” 
Who cried? Me? Nooooo, why would you think that? Red puffy eyes? I have no idea what you're talking about...So where to begin with this story? I won't say much because reading this book is a unique experience on it's own. You have to go in without knowing anything at all.But to sum it up, the story is about Taylor Markham, who was abandoned by her mother as a child and is now in a boarding school. Taylor is elected as a leader in the territory war games played by her school with the Townies (locals) and Cadets. But oh people, it's SO much more than that. The story might be confusion to start with, but just stick with it. The topics varies between responsibilities and grief and battles lots of mental health problems.I haven't read a proper YA in such a long while, but this was so much more than just that. Remember to keep your mind open and keep reading if you ever start this one, and please do. Also Jonah Griggs has captured my heart... Not only him though, the whole crew, past and present.

Even though it started off a bit slow for me, it took very little to draw me. I don't think I can even put in words how I felt while reading this book. I tried so very very very hard not to cry or feel but I'm sad to confess that I failed on all accounts. I can say without any doubt that Melina Marchetta has taken the award on being the best at killing you with the words that she writes. After this read ( as with all her books ) I'm left wanted more of her work and can't and wouldn't stop until I've devoured all of her works. This Book was majestically written and is sure to leave you gutted, weeping and feeling left both physically and emotionally drained.

I'd read (and ultimately given up on) something by author Melina Marchetta before - Finnikin of the Rock, which for me personally was not a good reading experience. So I wasn't expecting much with Jellicoe Road; ultimately, I ended up with a new favorite.This book is pure brilliance. The writing is superb; the way Marchetta crafted and executed her story is clever and unique; and the characters are so memorable, lovable, and genuine. Highest compliments from someone who's known to nitpick.*NOW TO CLEAR THE AIR*I do want to make a few points about Jellicoe Road that may make the reading experience more enjoyable: * Jellicoe Road is **not** a dystopian book. The 'war' is a traditional turf-competition between rival teenagers: those who live in the boarding school, 'Townies,' and Sydney Cadets who participate in a 6-week training program out in the bush. * There are two stories told simultaneously throughout the book. Taylor's story, set in the present day, in told in regular font, and the story that Taylor reads about is set almost 2 decades prior and is told in italicized font.* Pay attention to the characters, because this has a fairly large ensemble cast. I made little biographies of them on my bookmark. Seriously.* The book is set in Australia, so a wee bit of knowledge about the Australian education system would be beneficial (at the beginning, I just had a tab from the Wikipedia article up). What I look for in a powerful, ""favorite book"" type is a meaningful connection (I call it the 'Why Should I Care?' factor). Light-hearted entertainment is great, but the best stories (in my opinion) are the ones that are moving and substantial, stories that are simply unforgettable. If you read Jellicoe Road, I am willing to bet it will be a story you never forget. To be honest, I try to stay away from ""hot mess"" books; in other words, the types of stories in which characters simply have a screw loose. These are the stories (and yes, they seem to be on the rise in YA) in which characters do stupid things for apparently no reason and remain oblivious to the consequences of their actions. Yeah, we all have ""hot mess"" moments in our lives, so we can all relate, surely, but I want to see growth and character depth. I also don't like ""bummer books"" - meaning books that are just so heavy on sensitive subjects or ""issues"" that they descend into melodrama. With Jellicoe Road, what's interesting is that despite the heavy subject matter (and the book does deal with some pretty mature topics), Jellicoe never descends into melodrama. Marchetta's book is captivating, but it's not exhausting and it's not emotionally manipulative, either. There's just enough humor and hope mixed in to counterbalance the drama and tragedy. All of the characters have some hurt, habit, or hangup that they deal with over the course of the story, and this is definitely no exception for the two main characters, narrator Taylor Markham and (my favorite) Jonah Griggs. Taylor's young life is a complicated and sometimes depressing story, but Marchetta never casts her as a victim; over the course of the novel, Taylor manages to come to terms with her circumstances and tries to cope with them. In a genre that often portrays teenage girls as walking stereotypes, I greatly appreciated the way Marchetta created Taylor: strong, but also vulnerable; sweet on the inside, yet unsure how to express affection; scared of the future and life's uncertainties, but brave enough to take responsibility and leadership for her world. Perfect. And without saying too much, I think that Jonah Griggs is the **perfect** love interest that I just knew existed somewhere, but hadn't quite found yet. I don't mean he's 'perfect' like he's without flaws or has no personality, I mean his character compliments Taylor in just the right way. This was indeed a very strong pairing. I am a LEGIT fan.I know that this review is already really long, and if you've read everything so far, have a cookie on me!Two more things I want to address quickly:- Portrayal of Friendship: I'd argue that the theme of friendship is a major one in Jellicoe Road, and the relationships Taylor forges with her peers is both real and inspiring. It was so moving to watch a troubled, unsure young girl transform into a caring, empathetic leader. Beautiful! And Taylor's friends are so lovable and memorable, they definitely helped make the book what it is. I also loved and appreciated that these were healthy, substantial relationships, which brings me to my final point:- Portrayal of teenagers. I love YA and won't ever read any other genre as faithfully, but to be honest, quite a few books out there make me embarrassed for teenagers today, just based on the stereotypical ways they're portrayed. For a bunch of kids living in a pretty isolated community, with not a lot of useful teachers or adults around, these kids were pretty dadgum responsible. Like, incredibly so. And I'm not talking about one or two - I mean the whole ensemble cast. This may be a point of irrelevance to a lot of readers, but I wanted to point out how grateful and amused I was to read about such entertaining but mature teens. Maybe one of the (many) reasons why I loved this book is because I respected these characters, what they had to go through and how they handled themselves in the process. And my guess is that you will too.Quick say: I've found a new classic and a new favorite. Please (older teens) give Jellicoe Road a try.

Taylor Markham’s disconnect from everyone around her arises from a deep desire not to rely on or be relied on. Too much has happened to Taylor, specifically her abandonment by her mother and the desertion of Cadet Jonah Griggs when she tried to find her mother, to allow her to trust easily. When her friend and mentor Hannah disappears as well, Taylor retreats from her new responsibilities as leader of her school. It’s all perfectly justified in the text, but her complete irresponsibility drove me crazy.Taylor accepts the role not because she wants to be in charge, but because she hates the idea of being under anyone else’s control—and proceeds to screw up repeatedly because every time things get tough, she retreats to Hannah’s empty house. I hate it when people agree to do something and then ignore their responsibilities. It really gets on my nerves. So it was probably most of a hundred pages before I started caring about Taylor.And then I deeply cared about her. Once she starts letting people in, she’s engaging, tough, and loyal. She does have the ability to lead, and demonstrates it repeatedly, from brokering a peace between the three factions of school, Townies, and Cadets to finally tracking down her mother. I was impressed by Taylor’s strength and determination as well as her weaknesses—ultimately, by her humanity.Jellicoe Road has powerful secondary characters, all of whom are tied to Taylor in some way; in a sense, Taylor’s character is revealed by her allowing others to rely on her and be relied on in turn. And it’s not just her House members like Jessa and Raffaela, or anyone else in school, such as Ben or even the detestable Richard; Santangelo and Griggs, who originally seem like typical bullies, turn out to be some of the best friends she could ask for.Griggs fascinated me, and not just because he’s the love interest. He’s got as tragic a history as Taylor and is broken in his own way, and I love that their story begins long before the book does. He’s violent and mean, but it’s clear early on that this is something he puts on for show, a way of protecting himself. He’s conscious, as I think most children in his position are, of how much of him is like his abusive father, and the contrast between his more brutal behaviors and his tenderness toward Taylor makes him compelling.In addition to the wonderful characters, the structure of Jellicoe Road, with its intertwining stories, really won me over. I like having a challenge when I read, and Hannah’s “novel,” told out of sequence, was wonderfully challenging. Despite having trouble remembering which of the five characters was which to start, I found myself looking forward to the narrative intervals to see if I could puzzle out what happened. As a conceit, it’s a little too perfect—coincidentally the order in which Taylor reads the story reveals the truth in exactly the right order to keep her (and the reader) guessing, but the story itself is so compelling I was willing to give it a pass.What also worked for me is how that narrative ended up bringing the three factions together and undoing some of the misunderstandings that had arisen with time. At the beginning, it doesn’t look as if Taylor and her people can ever be friends with the Townies, headed by Chaz Santangelo, and the Cadets, led by Jonah Griggs (with whom Taylor has a history). And somehow they manage to stumble toward an accord that’s managed by the fact that both Griggs and Santangelo are essentially nice guys who have to work really hard at being jerks.This is ultimately a story about restoration: restoring Taylor’s faith in others, restoring her relationship with her mother, restoring the original understanding between the three factions. It also has a lot to say about how most people are essentially good. One of my favorite scenes is a very tense meeting between the three faction leaders and their seconds, where they can’t maintain the tension because the seconds are all musicians and drift away into an argument about amplifiers.As for Taylor and Griggs and their romance, it’s clear early on that he cares for her, but their relationship isn’t so much romantic (though it’s that too) as based on mutual need. The third story in this book, after the primary plot and Hannah’s story, is the truth about what happened when the two of them ran away—an episode that linked them both so it was inevitable they would ultimately come together. And yet that mutual need is as compelling a romance as I could want. The moment that brought them together, for me, wasn’t their first kiss, but the point where Griggs tells Taylor why he was on the train platform that day. Romance comes later—though Taylor has to point out to Griggs that he’s been romantic—and it’s incredibly satisfying. I can easily see the two of them lasting as a couple because of the depth of their connection.I read this twice for the Book Battle, the second time taking notes for my bracket, but by the time I reached Taylor and Griggs’ road trip I had to put the pen down because I was simply sucked into the story. It’s beautiful, and heart-wrenching, and I love how ultimately both narratives are about a need to belong to something bigger than oneself. I fully intend to come back to this book again and again.",14,default,"['own', 'favorites', 'book-battle-2016', 'protag-female', 'romance', 'supernatural', 'ya-contemporary-fiction']"

But any other word doesn't have quite the right strength. So when I say that it was devastating, read that as ""in all the right ways"". Which means I suspect it'll be one of my very favorite books ever, even though I doubt I'll be able to bring myself to reread it and I'll be careful about who I recommend it to.It's a challenging start, too, which doesn't help in the recommendation area. You have a huge cast of characters, a problematic viewpoint character, political factions (with subfactions and associated power dynamics), and a 22-year time span that all hit you right up front. Don't get me wrong, I was drawn in right from the start and Marchetta is good enough that I didn't feel lost so much as overwhelmed. Reading other reviews, it's clear that the reactions to this jumbled start are mixed and highly varied. Personally, Taylor drew me in immediately with her mix of vulnerability and courage so I was strongly engaged and willing to spend the mental energy to track all the moving pieces. And it does take mental energy because a lot of the story happens in the past and is revealed in patches and fragments along the way.The fact this all comes together (and gets such consistently high reviews for such a challenging work) is tribute to Marchetta's storytelling skill. All those pieces coalesce organically and very powerfully over the course of the novel to form a complete story that carries an immense emotional power. It'd be interesting to track a group of people who read the book in tandem and see how their experiences and opinions match up over the course of the novel. I suspect that while they'd be all over the map at the start, they'd quickly converge such that whatever drew them in initially (and kept them going past the challenging beginning) they'd be in shared-experience space relatively quickly. I think that's part of the power of the structure Marchetta has created because she weaves all those disparate elements of the story into a powerful whole that is full of those things that define us in our shared humanity—love, power, tragedy, despair, redemption, forgiveness, friendship, frailty, and family.There are a lot of elements coming together here, and I'm not organized enough to be terribly detailed. So here are some thoughts on some of them, for what they're worth.Griggs and Taylor I Loved the second-chance romance between Taylor and Griggs. I loved seeing the development of that relationship in the present and the reverberations from their meeting three years ago. I particularly liked seeing them draw strength from each other where they needed it most. But my favorite part of their relationship is that I can easily see it persisting a lifetime, even as young as they are. Theirs is a bond based on mutual respect and care and with their eyes open to the potential for change that the future brings (and working together to let that change unite rather than divide them).Time Fragments The ripples of three past tragedies (the third a near-miss with its own ramifications) are interwoven in the narrative in a way that is easy to get wrong. Marchetta does a fantastic job making these work in unison, even on their separate tracks. And even though it looks like you discover the key to each separately, they actually function together to deliver a catharsis at the end in a way that each not only builds on, but multiplies the effect of the others. This story could probably have been told chronologically. But that would have robbed it of so much of its power.Tate Sucks The truth we learn about Taylor's mother draws my sympathy for her personally, but horrifies me in regards to her daughter. (view spoiler)[It's bad enough that she dragged her daughter through her despair and drug addiction. But what kind of mother artificially constrains the love of the generous woman who will care for Taylor for the foreseeable future by extracting a promise not to become a surrogate mom?!? Talk about selfish in the extreme! That ended all sympathy for Tate and pissed me off at Hannah for giving such a promise. And then fulfilling it! Shame on both of them. And what I really hated is that everybody treated that as perfectly reasonable—including Taylor. (hide spoiler)]Magic or Spirituality or Something The supernatural has a very present, though subdued, place in this story. It's nothing too overt, mainly impressions and dreams. But I loved how not only the characters, but the story took these aspects of humanity seriously. I loved that they have real power (if only in the lives of those who experience them and take them seriously). I particularly liked the solid spirituality it gave the story without having to explain everything (even itself).Finally So yeah, I loved the book. I knew by a quarter through that I wouldn't be putting it down until I finished. I have no regrets for the lost sleep. The emotional punch at the end was everything you hope for in the very best stories.",14,default,['young-adult']

Usually doing that means one of the following: I am in a hurry to post a review for the book for a deadline (doesn't usually happen), or I love the book so much that I just have to write a review about it immediately.Such is Jellicoe Road, my second Melina Marchetta book. Ever since I finished and enjoyed Saving Francesca, I've been itching to read another Marchetta book to experience the goodness of her writing and the realness of her characters. But alas, I know I must pace myself because Jellicoe was the only other book I had of hers -- I still had to buy The Piper's Son and Looking for Alibrandi after Holy Week. After finishing two books from my Required Reading for April, I decided to reward myself with her book.And man, was it such a good idea. I gobbled up Jellicoe Road so fast that I surprised myself. Jellicoe Road is the story of Taylor Markham, whose mom left her when she was 11, picked up shortly by Hannah. At fourteen, she ran away from her boarding school to look for her mom only to be found and brought back by a stranger. Now, she's almost eighteen, and she is the leader of their school's underground community that is neck deep in a territory war with the kids from Jellicoe town called Townies and a group of kids undergoing military training aptly named Cadets. Then Hannah disappears and it throws Taylor's life out of the loop. If it wasn't enough, the leader of the Cadets turn out to be Jonah Griggs, a guy from Taylor's past that she's trying hard to forget. Taylor's life unravels as she tries to cope with Hannah's disappearance, piecing together clues Hannah left and things her memory is trying to hide from her.One word: wow. I was warned that this book would be an emotional ride, but I wasn't expecting that. It's really hard to describe the book without putting a spoiler, and the last thing you want to be with this book is to be spoiled. I've been warned that the first 100 pages or so of this book would be confusing, and indeed it was. For some people, this might be enough for them to stop reading and never revisit the book again, but trust me when I say this: don't. Keep on reading, and somewhere a few pages later, you'll find that this book had you in its grip and will refuse to let you go up until the last page.Just like in Saving Francesca, Marchetta definitely had her way with the characters and how they interact here. I thought the book would just be about the territory wars, which kind of turns me off, but the author made that as interesting as figuring out Taylor's past. I loved the relationships that the characters formed in this book -- they all had history with each other, and even if I have equally awesome friends, this book made me crave the same history that Taylor wanted: ""These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking."" I loved how they all just formed this friendship without too much effort, and how some characters who come off as annoying at first become even a little bit endearing in the end.But that plot -- oh that plot. When I got to my first ""aha!"" moment in the book, I just couldn't stop reading. I wanted to know what happens next and I want it now. At the same time, I also didn't want it to end. I just want to live in Jellicoe Road, if that was possible. I loved how everything tied up together at the end, and how the story kept on surprising me everyday. Even when I thought I had it all figured out, I was still surprised at the end, and I don't think I've ever read a book that did just that. When I was done with the book, I had an extreme desire to reread it all over again, if only to figure out what part I missed now that I knew how everything fits.While I was going through the first part of the book, I wasn't really sure if I would like it as much as my other bookish friends did. When I closed the last page, I was sure that I had just as much love for this book as they do. Like what I tweeted, reading this book was like breaking my heart and then putting it back together again. It was that awesome. Jellicoe Road reminded me of why I love contemporary YA, and it definitely made me a fan of Melina Marchetta. :)Read it, read it. Take your time with the start and be amazed at how Marchetta weaves a story so beautiful that it keeps a hold on you long after you have closed the book. ♥",14,default,"['2011', 'best-2011', 'contemporary', 'ya', 'tfg-100', 'favorites']"

A home to come back to every day of their lives.Where they would all belong or long to be. A place on the Jellicoe Road.
God, I could just sit here and sob all day.  (x)For about 0.2 seconds, I thought I would make it out alive. Oh, how I wish I could have those 0.2 seconds back. Just so I wouldn't have to feel this 
ache
 in my heart. It's really confusing at first. There's all the talk about territorial wars and people disappearing and a side story that I was having a hard to finding the relevance of for about 40% of the book. I would think to myself, ""is this really what I was afraid of? Would I actually leave this book unscathed. Unmoved? And Marchetta then said, ""let there be pain"".
My mother deserted me at the 7-Eleven, hundred of kilometers away from home. Hannah, however, did the unforgivable. She deserted me in our own backyard.
I was right to be afraid of On the Jellicoe Road. I'm afraid of anything that makes me feel too much, so you'll only see me intentionally pick up a book like this once-in-a-never. But this book... gah, this book is just something else entirely. It's painful, it's raw, it's funny, it'll make you want to cry out at the injustice of it all, it'll leave you screaming why why why why. 
“What do you want from me?” he asks. What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.
On the Jellicoe Road was faithful to life in the sense that not everyone gets the HEA they always dream of. To be honest, I don't think anybody does. But some less than others. Shit happens, life happens, and sometimes it's hard to pick your life back up. I wept over the lost promise of the future. I wept over the lives affected by tragedy. I wept for the broken friendships and the broken dreams. I wept for what could have been.
“Forgive me, Taylor Markham.” Before I could ask him how he knew my name and what I was to forgive him for he said, “take care of my little girl.”And then he told me to close my eyes.And I think I’ve been frightened to do just that ever since.
All I have to do is think about the ending to end up in tears again. Half of me is screaming to get my shit together and the other half, the half that's winning, is grieving. But it's not all doom-and-gloom and Jonah Griggs is sure to win your heart. Not even steal it, because you'll hand that sucker over to him everyday and twice on Sunday. This is undeniably an incredible story. You don't just get the Printz award for nothing. You get it for excellence. For being impactful. And that's exactly what On the Jellicoe Road was.

4.5 (Rating only dropped from five because gosh darn it I spent the first hundred pages of this novel thinking ""who are you people and why are there so many of you."")Gah. Where to start with a book like this? The first half is odd and so confusing. You understand the gist that there's a territory war going on between the residents of Jellicoe Road and they're split into three factions; the Townies, the Cadets, and the students of the Jellicoe School. Of course, enter our main cast, which is a mix of all three and you can see how this would be fun and entertaining. But this book doesn't stop there; there's also flashbacks to a group a generation before who suffered death through a huge car accident on Jellicoe Road. These flashbacks are vague in the beginning, but slowly gain clarity until the image is too heartbreaking and clear.Both groups are riddled with traumas and sadness. The main character, Taylor, was left at a 7-11 at eleven years old. The generation before suffered the death of most of their families in a huge car accident. Every character in this novel has a purpose, problems, and a personality all their own. It's so hard to not give legions of spoilers right now, but I'll resist the temptation so that those who haven't read this can be encouraged to do so.Marchetta's writing is unique to say the least. It's interesting, but oh so exiguous. By the end of the book, you still have no idea of eye colors, hair colors, and for some characters, you know absolutely nothing of how they look, just their typical facial expressions and maybe some body language.This was both great and frustrating. I appreciate her different way of approaching description since I created the images of the characters in my own mind, and even if they look the opposite of how I'm picturing them, I would still know them just by their walk or the way they crinkle their nose. I don't know; maybe my mild OCD is why the whole no general description drove me bonkers. That's my only complaint, and that's not even a real problem since I don't actually mind as much now that I've finished it. :)The final thing I wanted to praise was a parallel Marchetta hid in here. I loved that she did it, and adored how she presented it. (view spoiler)[(When Taylor saw Sam and thought about how she could have turned out the same way had her mother not ""given"" her to Hannah. I was so depressed I ate a whole bag of Haribo.) (hide spoiler)]All I can say is read this book. Especially if you enjoy books taking place in private schools, small towns, or Australia. Or contemporary YA, modern classics, novels with a darker tone, or books that will keep you guessing.

BRILLIANT.i was not entirely convinced by the book blurb (but i still read it anyway, since my GR friends insisted Jellicoe Road is really good). halfway through it revealed to me that yes, so maybe Jellicoe Road is award-winning. finishing & closing the book made me realized that Melina Marchetta conned me, but oh, how i loved to be conned this way! because Jellicoe Road is one BRILLIANT read. (I’m done reading in 6 hours! Man, i could not, would not put it down.)First half was so confusing – i did not know Marchetta is contructing two stories that will collide in the end. I needed patience to read Jellicoe Road and i was rewarded BIG time!Taylor’s strength came out in the middle of the story, when things started going awry that she needed to stay in control. I wanna hug her, tease her, and constantly remind her that her past (mistakes) does not define her future. She was willful, defiant, and cunning. I feel for her, especially with the dream scenes. They were heartbreaking.Griggs is one tough character. Not because he’s the leader of the Cadets, but because the story that Marchetta wove for him was dark, hopeless but resilient. His background made me appreciate him more at the end of Jellicoe Road. I found his character very strong – i just love him!This is not just a love story; there’s also a touch of mystery, crime & suspense. That’s a BIG plus for me!Jellicoe Road is also about family and friendships, and how you can find love and family in between those friendships. It is definitely a must-read. Why? Because Jellicoe Road will surely stun you into silence.

One of the highest-regarded YA novels I've encountered, with glowing endorsements, a stratospheric cume GR average, and a coveted Printz award, 2006's (On the) Jellicoe Road (my American version evidently dropped the ""On the"" from the title) is a clunky, melodramatic mess that aspires to share shelf space with the classics, but barely treads water in the bargain bin. Among my two GR friends that shared my lukewarm opinion of this, both opined words to the effect of ""it's not the book, it's me"" when explaining why they could not connect with the narrative. I can't be that charitable. Melina Marchetta has the duty as author to bring her Taylor Markham protag to life, give the reader someone to cheer for, loathe, feel  something for, not surround her in a sea of murk and expect the reader to generate feelings for her plight. It's not even clear what her plight is, exactly. We learn she was, at age 11, abandoned by her drug-addled mother at a 7-11 store on the Jellicoe Road, we know she attends a boarding school with ""warring factions"" between classes and residence houses (never explained well, and never really factors in the story, anyway), we know she has a boy that likes her named Jonah Griggs, and she may or may not like him back. There's a few Kenny Rogers jokes (yeah, the '70's-80's country crooner...how au courant). There's more flashbacks than you can shake a stick at, and  none of them makes an iota of sense. (Yeah, they eventually do, but by the time they do, you probably will have given up caring ). Heck, I'm getting confused and bored just writing this. I'll stop here, but I'll just say I just didn't get the appeal of this book. Kudos to those who could plumb its depths and derive meaningful enjoyment from it.

Taylor Markham; leader of the borders at the Jellicoe School. She is 17 years old, has no time for emotions and limited care factor for many things including the territory wars. She now has to ensure the borders don't lose to the cadets or the townies, things become a lot more complicated when she has to come face to face with Jonah Griggs; leader of the cadets and someone Taylor has history with.As Taylor begins her holidays as a senior, in charge of her house on campus, in charge of the borders co-hort during the wars; her world begins to change, Hannah disappears, a recurring dream is haunting her sleep and a manuscript that Hannah has written seems all too real and her own story is unknown to her.When I first started reading this story, it started off weird, I didn't really know what was happening or where Marchetta was going, I kept thinking this better pick up soon or I'm leaving it as a DNF, thankfully I kept going, I was engrossed into the story of Taylor, Griggs, Raffy and a like... It was a wonderful story that I had to finish quickly. I read Looking for Alibrandi back in high school and was always curious to read the author's other novels... On the Jellicoe Road has a bit of everything for everyone in it, suspense, pain, humor, romance and all in between... its a great coming of age novel that is directed at young adults, but I think anyone would appreciate this one...

That book was fantastic, but I have to admit that it had taken me a while to like it, like 100 pages or so. Then it just kept getting better and better.

They are not fictional at all, they're so real, raw, and to a point relatable. I loved them all, I was happy when they were happy, I was sad when they were sad, I was as devastated as they were and I was in sync with all of their emotions. The thing I was looking forward to in this book was the romance because I read A LOT about the amazing romance that is Jellicoe road, and seriously what were these people reading?! The romance is so not the point, it is not the focus and it takes a teeny tiny part of the story!!

By the end of the book, the characters in this first scene, which is set in the past, blend together with the present and we finally discover who was related to whom and how it all works. In real time there is a touching coming of age story about a teenaged girl living in a boarding School and sometimes with a women in an unfinished house. She is alone in the world, parents either dead or long since abandoned her and so she is a little lost, hard core, cynical and yet doing her best to be a leader in her group of girls and attempting to live her life. She is also desperate to make connections and to find out about her past.There are many appealing flashback stories about happy young sometimes beautiful kids living happy lives and loving each other. And there is also a lot of death and disaster and how all of that effects people. What would you be like if you'd've lost your family as a kid? Would you find a suitable substitute mother and or father? You have to pay attention early on to understand how all of the relationships work and how each is important to the present day.

Probably ever. My mind is a tangle of thoughts and emotions. Melina Marchetta, what have you done to me?This book is so achingly sad. This sadness seeped into my heart gradually. One drop after another, and then BAM! And it was overwhelming, and I couldn’t take it anymore, and I couldn’t breathe, and I was crying , crying…Many reviewers mentioned that at first On the Jellicoe Road was very confusing, and that they straggled with the beginning of the book. So I braced myself for this, but it never came. I was under Marchetta’s spell from the first sentence. Opening line that gripped me right away:
""My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. I counted.""
Melina Marchetta’s writing is beautiful and after I turned the last page I had a strong urge to open the book again and start from the beginning. This story has haunting quality; I can’t stop thinking about it.And her characters, these wonderful broken characters. I loved them.

At least at first. The story is about Taylor Markham, a high school student who was abandoned by her mother at the 7-Eleven when she was 7. From my understanding, it won the Printz Award. There are 2 story lines in this book that alternate, past and present. They come together to reveal the mystery behind Taylor's identity and family history. The way Melina wrote the story was very confusing for the first half of the book. She jumps right in without explanation and you get so much thrown at you that it's hard to process it all. I've read and enjoyed books written like this before, but this one took a bit too long to get some answers and by then I had forgotten a few details. Everything does come together at the end though.The plot itself is very emotional and dense with a touch of mystery added. Though I didn't really care for the ""war games"" going on at the school. It was poorly explained and I found it was pointless as it was in the story but nothing was really done with it. Like an after-thought. The characters were well constructed. I enjoyed their simplicity.While I can't say that I was awed by this novel, I did find the story very touching.

On the one hand, if they are done right, the story hooks you, and makes you need to know how the disparate scenes are connected, and how they got to be what you're seeing. Those kinds of stories are fantastic. On the other hand, there are stories like [On the] Jellicoe Road, which just plop you down in the middle of everything - present, past, dreams, etc - with everything melding together and creating this surreal stew, which leaves the reader utterly confused until such a time as the author decides to, I dunno, introduce a character mid-way through the book. This is the type of book that requires a patient reader... and a patient reader I am not. I tried starting this book on my Nook several times, and I just could not get into it. The opening line is fantastic, and the prologue always hooked me with a promise of this book being the kind that would speak to me in emotional terms... but then the book proper would lose me... every single time. It's just too jumbled, and the abrupt shifts of main character (which I didn't even realize until attempt #4 at starting this), perspectives and scenes just threw me off and I'd move to something less confusing... promising myself that another time I'd try again with Jellicoe. Then this book ended up being my real life bookclub book, and I determined to push through and actually finish it, because I'm determined to finish all of the bookclub books. But still I found it hard to actually READ this book. Maybe it was the formatting of my Nook copy, which is very... free-verseish? Not sure if this is how the actual book is or if there's a problem with my copy, but it was extremely distracting. So I said screw it and downloaded the audio from Audible. So now I've finished, and well... I don't know. For much of the book I was quite a bit less than impressed, but after the 60% mark the story actually DID start coming together and I was (finally) intrigued to see where it went. But having to trudge through 2/3 of a book in confusion is a LOT to ask of readers, especially (I think) teen and YA readers, which is the target audience. And, personally, I just don't think it was worth it. I think it could have been more coherent and written in a way that doesn't require the reader to have the patience of Job just to get to the part where the STORY starts. And this was especially true of the audio, because with that damn music leading and ending each chapter, it felt like each chapter was a series of individual snapshots rather than a story. Once the past and present storylines finally joined up I was almost fed up waiting for it.That being said, I did enjoy the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and Fitz. I enjoyed the message, that family is found in the most surprising situations and that we never know what the future will hold, so it's best to live and love in the moment. I also felt like this was a story of absolutes, the kind of absolutes that make moving on near to impossible because of the amount of oneself given into another person's care, and how dangerous that can be for the one who gives of themselves that way... you might never be able to be whole again. Not that that lesson was learned by the younger generation though, because even learning of Tate's struggles after loving someone so completely that she's literally incapable of functioning without him, Taylor jumps right onto that bandwagon and goes for the same kind of ride. Fuckin' insta-love.And that's all I'll say about that. I did actually like Jonah though. He was pretty funny, and as a love interest in a YA story, I can say with complete honesty that he's probably one of the most likeable and relatable I've read about in a long, long time. Just a smidge too-good-to-be-true, but at least he wasn't emotionally abusive or controlling or fucking psychotic like is apparently the IN THING in YA these days. So, overall, I was underwhelmed by this story. I wanted it to be great, and I wanted it to really wow me. But it just didn't. There were some great moments, some poignant scenes, and even a little tear may have been jerked toward the end... but then I kept waiting for it to end... and perfect endings were coming and going, and I'm sitting there thinking ""What is she waiting for? END THE STORY."" I think the book should have ended at the end of Chapter 25. Maybe the epilogue would still be OK, because it doesn't need chapters 26 or 27 to exist. But it just kept going, and that again was an irritation, because it felt a little manipulative. Gotta squeeze out that last little bit of emotion by stretching the Tate & Taylor bit, wrapping up the Hannah & Jude, and the Taylor and Jonah romances, and tying everything with a lovely pink ribbon. There, finally finished. But ugh... I LIKE endings that leave the reader feeling satisfied with a resolution but not locked in with no room for post-read imagination or wonder. So... yeah. I wanted to like this a LOT more than I actually did. But at least I finished it, finally, thanks to Audible and 2x speed.

They may overlook these young adult books, and we know that young adult books will never get a Nobel prize or something, but sometimes they forget that teenagers also deserve books that they can relate to. That's when young adult book becomes important because it--in particular way--helps shape the personality of young souls. A good young adult book can provoke the mind of its young readers--a better one can wreck and havoc their feeling. Marchetta's Jellicoe Road is one of the better ones. Marchetta's flair in capturing the teenage angst becomes her strongest point in this book. Let's be real here. Teenage angst is something real, and adult people sometimes forget that being a teenager can be hard because teenagers still search who they really are, they still search their real self, and it's a hard phase. They're a vagabond, looking for the meaning of life, and if they run into wrong side, they can ruin their life forever. So, see, it's hard being a teenager. And that's what makes Jellicoe Road feel so emotional and raw because Marchetta is being honest to their readers. She gives us an imperfect protagonist and says, ""Here's Taylor Markham. She's having trouble, like most of you, so let's see how she solves her problems together."" Taylor is a sincere character. Her angst, her search for her mother, her frustration, and her insecurity are not artificial. They all are perfectly captured by Marchetta, captivated in an amazing and extremely beautiful way of writing, that feels so soulful and emotional. It's really hard to write in such ways, that you can feel every part of Taylor's soul insinuated on Marchetta's sentences; that sometimes Taylor and her friends were alive, and the story Hannah writes were alive as well. She handles her problem in the most teenage way as possible, and sometimes she makes mistakes. But Marchetta tells her readers it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to cry, it's okay to get angry, because that's how you learn. It's just heartbreaking to follow Taylor's journey in finding the true meaning of family and friendship. Jellicoe Road is such an important book for young readers because they can learn a lot about family and friendship from a book that they can relate. It indeed deserves that Michael L. Printz award, one of the highest awards that a young adult book can get. When Narnie asks her father, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey"", and her father answers, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand"", I think he's wrong.

Jonah Griggs takes my hand under the table and links my fingers with his and I know that I would sacrifice almost anything just to keep this state of mind”Marchetta has gain created a masterpiece! I absolutely loved Saving Francesca, but Jellicoe Road has left me lost for words. Her writing is utterly mind blowing! I was just sucked into a completely different world of cadets, townies and kids at the boarding school competing for territories, it felt so real and I loved it so much, that I just didn’t want this book to end. Taylor is one of the best female characters I have come across in a while; she had this fearlessness about her that I really liked. I absolutely adored Raffy and Santangelo, every time they were together they just brought a huge smile to my face. I loved Jonah, he wasn’t your typical male character; we got to see his macho side and also his vulnerable side, which he tried to keep guarded (this just made me love him even more!). Finally I loved the poignant friendship between Jude, Webb, Fitz, Narnie and Tate. Jellicoe Road has definitely become one of the best books I have ever read; it was intense, heartbreaking and simply unforgettable. Some of my favourite quotes;“Then why are you here?”... He stops and looks at me “I’m here because of you. You’re priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way is tuned into mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime”I feel tears running down my face and Raffy takes my hand and squeezes it.“What are you so sad about?” Santangelo says to me. “We’re going to know him for the rest of our lives”But I don’t want to let go, because tonight I’m not looking for anything more than being part of him.

I will not give any type of a summary as there is no way that I will ever do this story justice. I will just say that Marchetta is a genius. I have read a couple of her previous books and loved them as well but this one is my all time favorite of all time. I heard going into it that the beginning was confusing as hale and I totally agree with that, but just because it is confusing doesn’t mean it isn’t gorgeously written. I know fully believe that this woman can write anything and I will love it. Her way with words is like a song they just sing to the reader. The story of Webb, Narnie, Tate, Jude, and Fitz was the hardest story I have ever read and I loved every minute of it. I loved trying to figure out all the confusion that Marchetta weaved into her story and I am proud to say that I figured out everything except for one detail that I should have seen but overlooked as my love for a character shadowed my eyes. Taylor was a great character. I loved her relationship with Jonah. She took no poo from him and he took no poo from her it was a very realistic from the start. There was one part in the book that my heart literally jumped right out of my chest and when you read this you will know the exact page where it happened because that scene is very overwhelming and so real that it hurts.

My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted

It’s hard being fair with this book because it pissed me off like no other book before. and I have such a complicated feelings towards it because I think it had the potential to be a stunning coming of age story and yet it felt sloppy and misleading which made me resent the fact that its execution miserably failed its content; Disappointing.Everyone who read the book will tell you that the first half is an absolute confusion and that’s true ; I agree 100%. But for me it wasn’t only confusing, it was also messy, pointless and absolutely ridiculous once you know what the story is really about.The author uses the first half of the book focusing on just one element of the story and because it’s so intense, you are lead to think that it’s the central storyline of the book and yet it actually turns out to mean basically nothing when it comes to the bigger picture; an inside joke between some of the characters , Yes, It has some sentimental value but that’s it.

It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love

And I don’t know how to feel about that, Because the author wasted half of her material on basically nothing when she have so many things to depict and portray like the loss of a loved one, grief, survival guilt and abandonment issues. Yes, the story once it gets going is deeply sad and moving but that doesn’t mean it’s written or executed well; The story after all deals with sensitive issues that I’m not immune to. If someone in the street tries telling a sad story and you feel for it and it affects you, it doesn’t mean he/she is a great storyteller, it just means you’re having a proper human reaction to something that will upset anyone.Also the transition from the first half to the second is so jarring, It doesn’t give you time to well adjust and to connect to the characters and what’s happening to them.

Hold my hand because I might disappear

Speaking of the characters; expect the main one who’s well written and fleshed out; the others are simply there, they’re not complex, they don’t have anything that’s for them and they felt flat to me.

Maybe memories should be left the way they are

The book alternates between 2 timelines that are connected somehow. I was invested way more to the past timeline, I thought it was engaging, deeply touching but rushed and neglected. I think if the book was split equally between the two timelines, I would’ve been completely in love with it. Everything about the past storyline was convincing and believable and it made me feel deeply for the characters while the present timeline felt unconvincing, confusing and not well executed. 

Grief makes a monster out of us sometimes . . . and sometimes you say and do things to the people you love that you can't forgive yourself for. 

I’m really upset because I wanted to love this book and I expected it to be a new favorite of mine and it could’ve been but here we are , Maybe I’m missing some hidden meaning in that first half that would make all of it worth it, maybe I’m not getting it the way I should. But all I know is I didn’t love the book and honestly the difference between how much I wanted to and how much I don’t is making me feel miserable.But take my review with a grain of salt, I was buddy-reading this book with 4 other amazing friends and they all loved it, I think they gave it all 5 stars so I think even though it didn’t appeal to me that much, It could be a favorite for others",12,default,"['buddy_read', '2019', 'literary-fiction']"

There might be slight potential spoilers in my review. Taylor Markham was a teenage girl living in a boarding school. Her mother deserted her when she was very young and a woman named Hannah living in the vicinity of that school had found her all those years ago. Hannah sort of looked after her for a while until Taylor was a permanent resident of Jellicoe school. There she and her friends got in a kind of territory war with other kids from other schools but her mind was mostly occupied with finding ways to search for her mother and discover her past. The book began with a story written by Hannah about a fictional accident where two families died twenty years ago. After the accident, the kids of those families grew up together in that same boarding school. They had the kind of friendship that could only be formed by people who had no one but each other in the world. One day Hannah just disappeared without any explanation and Taylor was devastated because Hannah was the only person she thought was hers. Taylor was often drawn towards that incomplete story by Hannah and around in the middle of the book she began to have a feeling that her past had a link to that story. How exactly were those fictional characters connected to her? Why did her mother leave her when she was young? How did Hannah know exactly where to find her and why did she even care for Taylor so much? This is the type of book where for a long time nothing makes sense and then as you go on all the seemingly unimportant loose threads wrap up neatly.Jellicoe Road is a nearly perfect YA book in my opinion. This book deals with grief. The grief of losing the person that meant the world to you or even losing the person you never knew but loved anyway. This is a perfect tragedy. While reading it I couldn't help but think of Zafar Iqbal and Sheba prokshoni books that I loved as a child. Particularly one by Sheba called ""Class Eight"". Those fights over which group gets to use which part of the town, boarding school shenanigans, unlikely friendships with someone you thought would be an enemy, teen angst, little character moments that will make you feel so sad- all these elements are so beloved to me because I grew up with them. The only complaint is that some of the characters especially the juniors acted too juvenile. I kept seeing the thirteen-year-olds as 7-year-olds in my mind because of how they talked. And Taylor acted too impatient and dumb most of the time. It took awfully long for everything to be resolved that readers would see from miles. Taylor's history I could predict almost immediately after I started to get into the story because twists like this had been done many times. I wonder why it took her so long to connect everything about her past. But in my opinion, nobody should read it for the twists but the life and turmoils of an abandoned and a toughened teenage girl. For the hearts in past broken beyond mending. And for those families that had everything until they didn't. I did a bad job explaining what I felt reading this story...suffice to say it stomped on my heart with the force of an angry buffalo. I'm sobbing my heart out at 3 in the morning and I can't breathe. And crying while reading books is rare for me.

What to say about this book...I've put off writing this review, because I don't really know how to describe it in a coherant fashion. For the first 150 pages or so, I was absolutely lost. I contemplated giving up several times and could not keep up with how disjointed this story was. Melina Marchetta wasted absolutely no time diving right into the guts of the plotline, offering exceedingly little explanation. At times, I felt like I was nodding along with a conversation about quantum physics or (cringe) politics, while posses no prior knowledge of the subject. Thank God my GR friends encouraged me to keep on reading. Marchetta is a beautiful, poetic writer. There are so many quotes within this novel that I want to write down in a notebook and keep with me at all times, or have tattooed somewhere discreet. They're that profound. She nailed the complexity aspect of this novel. I did need some further discussion and explanation following my completion of the book, so I could make sure that I actually understood what happened, but once I was clued into each detail, I was blown away. There are so many different interwoven layers within Jellicoe Road. I highly suggest, at the advice of Alexa, to keep a sheet of paper with you and write the characters names down in order to keep them straight. This might sound silly, but it would've helped me so much more if I'd have done this! Taylor Markham is a fantastic female lead. She is independent and loyal. She has a bit of a temper, but that just makes her colorful. I thought at the beginning that she was kind of frigid towards some of the girls within her House, but she can't help it. Taylor had so much love and affection within herself, but came off emotionally constipated, likely due to her tragic past and difficulty with those close to her. I loved, loved, LOVED the progression of the relationship between Jonah and Taylor. Jonah is so incredibly romantic <3 I will definitely go back and re-read some of his lines whenever I need a good swoon. I loved them because there was an underlying affection, even though both of them were supposed to be die-hard enemies. The two fit so perfectly together, like some heart-shaped puzzle piece (so corny, I know. It's late.) I want more of these two, yet I'm 100% satisfied with their situation and how the story ended. The story of Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Webb, and Jude is a heartbreaking one. Again, I can't say much about these five without giving away a rather significant portion of the story, but this bunch claimed my heart and ran with it. Jellicoe Road and all of its characters were filled with this all-encompassing love for one another, that I could feel my heart swelling even though I had tears streaking down my face. I don't think I've ever read so many characters that possessed such selfless, genuine love for one another. And the best part? It wasn't cheesy at all. It felt real. You know what else felt real? The angst. The heartbreak. The losses. And there's quite a bit of each category in this one. Be prepared. Surround yourself with a few boxes of Kleenex. I will definitely be reading more of Marchetta's work in the future, but am slightly intimidated that all her stories will be as complex as this one. Truly, though, her writing is so wonderful that the brain-busting will be worth it. ",12,default,"['read-in-2010', 'paid-full-price', 'books-i-own']"

Taylor Markham yearns for a history. A fragmented past filled with loss and pain haunts her dreams and days. So much of her past is a mystery she cannot piece together without a little help from her friends. This book is filled with characters that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. Every single one of them made an impression on my heart—the Mullet Brothers, the second in commands, terrifying 14 year old girls ;), Santangelo, Raffy, Hannah, Webb, Tate, Jude, Fitz, Taylor, and Jonah. They made me crave the days when I was surrounded by my friends and family everyday. To be honest, I didn’t really let myself see and feel how much I missed it until Jellicoe Road. With emails, texts, calls, and Skype, I try to delude and sway my heart to believe it is the same. But nothing really replaces that closeness.

Jellicoe Road was one hell of a journey filled with mystery, love, fun, grief and pain.

It is a book that you need to go into knowing little about. For the first 100 or so pages, I was completely baffled. The chapters are confusing and the main plotline seems to hover on the periphery never really coming close enough for you to figure out. The writing is intense and emotional and remained so, even when I couldn't quite grasp what it was i was feeling.I don't even really know what to say, other than I knew Melina was building this story from where it needed to begin, and that she wrote the story this way for a reason. Trust me, she did. In the end, when all the little threads of plot so carefully crafted at the beginning of the book start coming together, you are left with a story so compelling, so heartbreakingly beautiful. One unlike anything you have ever read before. It's hard to describe a book that seemed to elude me for most of the time I was reading it. This is a story about a girl who got left behind, about friendships so unique they span years, and about identity. It's about the Jellicoe Road, which stays a constant to every character in the book tying them all together, like its not just a road, but a character in its own right. Melina has this way with words that just pulls you under leaving you with no choice but to immerse yourself in them. She builds her characters in a way that makes you wish you knew them. To Taylor who is blunt and hurt and afraid and kick ass in a way not a lot of teenage girls are. To Raf who is strong and sassy and has such a wonderful outlook on life. To Santangelo who's grown up in a woman's world and is all the more better for it. To Jonah, who's built like a tank and tastes of honey. To Hannah, who carries the book in a way I could never understand. To the people who lived on the Jellicoe Road, who know the true meaning of friendship, grief, understanding and love.

But here is what happened; I didn’t understand what was going on in the book until I was in the middle of it. I even thought of abandoning the book but the writing was beautiful and kept me going. And when it started making sense, it was worth all the chaos. Things that I loved:As I mentioned earlier Jellicoe Road is definitely tough to get into but Melina Marchetta’s writing will suck into this strange world where kids learn to protect theirs and take over others’ land. I loved that all the characters had multiple layers and a deeper story. I loved that even before I understood the plot I got deeply invested into the lives of these kids that I couldn’t stop reading.I am totally in love with the kids from 80s in the manuscript.The characters in Jellicoe Road deal with death, grief, abandonment, drugs addiction and suicide and I am sure for a Young Adult book this is too heavy. I am still confused whether to tag this one as Young Adult or contemporary or even a mystery. Things that didn’t work for me:I am finally getting used to not searching for responsible adults in YA and you wouldn’t find them in Jellicoe Road. And I am not gonna lie, it did feel like it took ages to understand who they were and what happened to them. Though I kinda guessed it about three-fourth into the story, but I am not going to complain. While I am happy at how things turned out for the three factions, I also am kinda annoyed that the story took huge diversion from that part of the story. There were times when the teenage angst and the whiny female lead got to me, but I am glad I chose to eye-roll and ignore them. Bottomline:If you are ready for a roller coaster ride that may or not end up in happy tears Jellicoe Road is the perfect YA for you.Blog | Facebook | Twitter |  Amazon |",11,default,"['reviewed', 'a-z2018', 'fiction', 'ya', '2018', 'e-books', 'suspense']"

The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.” 5++++ stars because this brilliant novel deserves them!Do you want to get lost in the world of summer, trees, sunrise, sunset, friendship, love, memories, nostalgia which is constructed by lyrical writing, raw emotions and masterfully forged mystery? Then you should definitely read Jellicoe Road without further ado.I lived in this book. I fell for its characters. I fell in love with their friendship and story. I laughed with them. I cried with them and I died a little every time with them. 
 I loved this book and it’s going to be forever etched it my heart. 
Five stars and more are for books like this. I don’t give special place to every book in my shelf right away. I don’t give any book five stars like candy.  Books like Jellicoe Road show me a very different world, emotionally connect me to the characters, make me wonder about life, happiness, grief and in the end, teaches me something beautiful and devastating. This book first starts with a prologue of worlds colliding at Jellicoe Road which slowly grows into a powerful friendship. The story shifts between past, present and dreams. Initially, the plot may be confusing and you may not be sure where it takes you but as you continue, you’ll see the story masterfully unravelling in front of your eyes. The constant shifting of present and the story from the past kept me intrigued and I couldn’t stop turning pages fast enough. The past has a beautiful story about 5 best friends; Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz and the tragedy that befalls them.  “And then their voices stopped and their souls stood still and they ceased being who they had been. Because who they were had always been determined by him.”In the present, we have Taylor Markham, 17, Jellicoe School student and reluctant leader of the territory wars that take place between Jellicoe School, Cadets from a school in Sydney and teens from the town. Taylor was abandoned at the age of 11 by her mother on Jellicoe road and rescued by Hannah, one of the House guardians of Jellicoe School. Past and present are inextricable and to understand her present better, Taylor is curious to know about her past and her search leads her to the tragic story of 5 best friends from the 80’s.“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking.”Every character in this book is created with so much emotions and depth to the point that they feel real. They have strengths, they have flaws, they have grief, they have happiness but all in all, they are bound by love. The plot is intricately designed, the writing is lyrical and the story is powerfully told. Even after re-reading this book several times, I've never got exhausted by this story.To put it simply, Jellicoe Road is a uniquely written masterpiece. It’s my all-time favourite book along with The Book Thief. Everyone should read it with lots and lots of tissues and chocolates in handy. “And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die.”",11,default,"['admirable-characters', 'contemporary', 'mystery', 'amazing-plot', 'books-i-fell-in-love-with', 'beautiful-writing', 'favourites', 'books-that-should-be-more-popular', 'best', 'books-that-had-an-impact-on-me']"

You have:-this school battle that sounds like it may be dystopian or apocalyptic (it's not) so you're trying unnecessarily to figure out this new world (and those of us who aren't Australian trying to figure out the school grade system).-you are introduced to all the characters right off the bat from all the houses at the boarding school plus cadets and townies and how they all relate together. I was worse than lost those first few chapters.-the story is periodically interrupted with italicized inserts of a whole new cast of characters you're not sure how they relate to the story or each other.-Taylor has vague dreams that don't make sense, plus a history of being abandoned by her mother that you know you're not getting the full story about.-Hannah has her own history she's not sharing and you can't quite figure out her relationship to Taylor or the school.-and a prologue from twenty years before (a beautiful introduction by the way), which I got later was related to the characters in the italicized inserts (duh, it's the same names) which made them so much more interesting once they had a foundation, but when everything was dumped on me at once, it took a good hundred pages before I wasn't confused at what characters were in what scenes and how everything related together and even half the time what was happening.The only things that kept me going were A) my own stubbornness (because this book has gotten such rave reviews and I was bound and determined to find out why) and B) Griggs. While I found Taylor a bit annoying, I was dying to crack Grigg's shell. I honestly don't know if I would have finished the book if it weren't for him, which is a shame because by midway, I was so caught up in Taylor's story, I finished it in a day. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. I know if I went back and reread the book, it would be so much more poignant the second time around, but I'd rather have been caught up in the first time instead of being so frustrated.Once I understood all that Taylor is protecting inside, I wanted to protect her and help her along this journey to discover why she was abandoned by her mother years ago. I loved her relationships and some of the dialogue and in the end I cried for her. All the characters are endearing. It's that powerful and beautiful and tragic. And the ending is perfect. The only thing that was a stretch for me was that she didn't figure out the mystery right off the bat, and if she knew, we should have known. But it didn't bother me too much to discover the journey along with her.",12,default,"['young-adult', 'mystery-thriller', 'romance', 'contemporary']"

Here's the thing: her writing is powerful and deeply emotional, and it's difficult not to gush, stare at the pile of tissues next to the reading chair and wonder how she managed to make you cry so often and like it, or otherwise succumb to a state somewhere between awe and stupor. I've learned to have high expectations every time I start one of her novels. I don't give a lot of five-star reviews; out of the last 80 or so books I've read, I've given five stars to seven, and three of them are Melina Marchetta novels. The beginning of this one, as several reviewers have pointed out, is a little bit confusing. There are two stories being told, a present-day narrative and a story about five teenagers in the past. In the present-day narrative, seventeen year-old Taylor Markham, whose mother abandoned her at a 7-11 when she was eleven, is the reluctant leader of the the boarders' faction in a school territory war between the boarders, Cadets, and Townies. “Huh,” I thought. “Maybe this will be the Marchetta novel I don't end up loving.”WRONG. Then I was sucked into the rabbit hole, completely captivated by the characters and their stories. Grief and guilt are major themes here; the stories of these teens are riddled with more tragedy than any young person should have to bear. It's almost too much weight for a narrative to bear, really. But while part of the point is that there's something about grief that is fundamentally lonely, Marchetta's characters typically refuse to let each other carry its burden without help. They get angry with each other, annoyed with each other. They might refuse to communicate with each other for a while, and at other times, they might not communicate very well. However, on a very basic level, one of this author's greatest talents is the representation of friendships held together by love, force of will, and sheer faith in the notion that the friend is worth the effort. It's part of why her secondary characters tend to be so endearing, and it's a major step in the growth arc for her each of her main characters. I don't know what else to say about this remarkable novel other than to speculate that if it doesn't emotionally affect a reader on at least some level, I have no idea what to do with that reader. I'd be tempted to make the sign of the horns for protection, go all Jenny-from-the-Outlander-series-in-a-bad-moment, and declare, “Ye have nae soul!”Okay, kidding on that last part.Sort of.

It took a good ¼ to 1/3 the book to basically get what was going on and much further on to get all my questions answered, yet reading it was a satisfying and fun experience; I was more intrigued than frustrated as I read and tried to fathom what was going on.I do think it screams out for a reread, and because I’m committed to reading other books and knew I wouldn’t be rereading this book in the near future, about ¾ the way through I went back and skimmed/read all the passages in italics in order to to bring myself up to speed. I think reading it for a second time would be even more enjoyable, but I did love most of it.There is a completely engaging writing style and memorable, complicated characters, both very satisfying!Some things I liked best: The parts about To Kill a Mockingbird were great; Mrs. Dubose was a character that always made a huge impression on me. The humor comes at opportune times in this story, in many places; I thought page 300 was particularly hilarious, and all the humor was so welcome because this story has components that are sad, tragic, scary, and otherwise dark.Some things I liked least: The dream sequences (except for one at the end that I did love, especially the way it solved one of the mysteries) and the allusions to life beyond death were not, for the most part, my cup of tea. And, maybe just a bit too much happened; I liked it all as I was reading it, but when I got to the end, I don’t know how to explain it, but it felt too busy. Given how much pleasure I got from reading it, perhaps I’m wrong and perhaps just the right amount of content was included. The seemingly mandatory teen romance(s) that are in young adult books with teenage characters; I’d like to read just a few sans that plot point.It’s definitely worth continuing to read as the reader is eventually let in on everything that’s going on and all the mysteries are solved.4 to 4 ½ stars",11,default,"['novel', 'young-adult', 'fiction', 'bookclub', 'goodreads-author', '1-also-at-librarything', 'readbooks-female-author-or-illust', 'z2011', 'zz-4star', 'reviewed']"

As much as I enjoyed the end, it was too little to late for me. If not for all the positives I had heard from Bookers, I probably wouldn't have finished it at all. That being said, it was worth it to stick it out. It tied everything together and I get it. I almost feel like I should read it all over again, that way everything would make sense.

But when you think about the comparatively short time students spend there, it makes sense. No matter how ancient its foundation, no establishment - school, college, regiment, club, whatever - is really any older than its current most senior members, which in the case of most schools means four to six years. After that the only explanation for any local custom or observance would be, “We’ve always done that.” With the Jellicoe School, an Australian boarding school about 600 kilometres from Sydney & another kilometre this side of the Black Stump, the principal preoccupation is a form of mock combat called the Territory Wars, a three-sided struggle between the students of the Jellicoe School, the Townies - the teenagers who live in the nearby town itself - & the Cadets, boys bused out from a military school in Sydney to encamp for their annual field exercises. Some readers, probably mostly attracted by the story’s relationships, find the Territory Wars a distraction. I loved them & thought they gave the school real distinction - without them, On the Jellicoe Road would be like Tom Brown’s School Days without Rugby (duh!) football. The principal character & narrator, Taylor Markham, is the House Leader of one of the school dormitories, which makes her a caregiver & advisor for the junior girls, as well as a major strategist in the Territory Wars. She has a complicated & stormy emotional life, having been given away by her addict mother (@ a 7/ll store) to a woman named Hannah who acts as Taylor’s guardian as well as being a kind of non-resident house supervisor. The rules for the Territory Wars are set down in a purple covered book which is passed on from one senior class to its successors. I’m a bit vague on how they’re conducted tho’ eventually we discover their origin - they seem sort of like a large scale version of Capture the Flag with no flag fought for access to trails & to the river. Hostages are taken to effect the transfer of territory, but they, especially the younger girls, are treated with courtesy & respect. Violence seems to be limited to an occasional punch up amongst the boys & negotiations & peace talks occur with all the gravitas of Bismarck or Kissinger. But there is also a backstory, partly told in the form of a MS (printed here in italics) written by Hannah that Taylor is reading, that involves an earlier generation of characters who come to figure importantly in the present story as well. Besides her school life, Taylor has to deal with two other emotional relationships, her quest for the mother who abandoned her & her growing attachment to Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets. I loved this book & definitely ranked it in the top five school stories that I’ve read by contemporary authors, alongside (in the order I read them) Patrick Gale’s Friendly Fire, Megan Abbott’s Dare Me, Anton DiSclafani's The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls, & Tana French’s The Secret Place. Some of the parallels are striking: like Sophie in Friendly Fire, Taylor is in effect an orphan for whom her school is also her home & family. Like Dare Me & Yonahlossee, Jellicoe Road gives us miniature world in which competition is the principle of moral & spiritual formation - along with caregiving as in The Secret Place. In On the Jellicoe Road we see how a five-star book illumines those we’ve already read. If you like school stories & you’re not living in Australia, get hold of the audio version. Not only does Rebecca Macauley read it beautifully, but you’ll hear Taylor & the other characters speaking in their own vernacular. Indeed, I enjoyed it so much that I’ll be pleased to give my copy of the CD to the first GR friend who asks me for it, if you’ll promise to pass it on to another reader to enjoy afterwards.",10,default,"['the-secret-history', 'five-stars-in-2015']"

Five months after...Have you ever been intimidated to write up a review of a book you just read?Where you scramble to find the right words to best describe the full experience of what you just went through but come up with a page-full of inadequate sentences and ramblings that made little sense? This was how I felt when I read Jellicoe Road. The first few pages of this book confused me. I remember thinking that maybe I was out of my depth and that I should stop and save it for a day when my mind wasn’t so full of cobwebs. But there was just something about Narnie’s silent tenderness that wouldn’t let me stop. So I read; until the words off the pages became clearer and the characters of the book spoke with determined voices. I read until the book became a movie in my mind’s eye and the heartaches became so visceral that reading became a cycle of starts and stops. But no matter how much time I gave myself, the characters’ miserable plights became even more heartbreaking that I found myself tearfully wondering - why the heck was I putting my heart in an emotional blender? I am one of those readers who steer clear of angst and reality fiction for the simple fact that I read to escape. My life is real enough. I’d rather read of rainbows and unicorns and slain dragons. But after reading Jellicoe, I couldn’t help but feel that I was missing a whole lot.Before Jellicoe Road, I read Melina Marchetta’s Saving Francesca and The Piper’s Son first. Don’t get me wrong, both books affected me in their own rights. But Jellicoe Road is something else altogether. Once I figured out the elaborate web of this novel, I learned to appreciate the overwrought and emotional journey that Melina Marchetta took me at the time. I love the way Melina made me fall in love with a character that to some may consider flawed beyond redemption.Take Tate Markham, for example. She fell apart because the love of her life died; so much so that she couldn’t even stay sober for her child. She abused her body by any means necessary to stay numb. I found her selfish and weak, neglectful of the single person who should’ve been her solace and salvation. But throughout the book, did I feel any contempt against her? The answer is, no. I found it difficult to get angry when all I could feel was her palpable loss. Melina Marchetta's writing is that potent. I could go on and on about every character in this book, but I’d probably just end up repeating myself anyway. I read On the Jellicoe Road last May and it’s taken me a while to actually write a proper review. I have been re-reading this on days when not a single book on my shelf looks enticing. I can honestly say that asking me to pick which among of Melina Marchetta’s works is my favorite is like asking me to pick which of my two children do I love more. It’s just wrong. This is an award-winning book that rightfully deserves all the accolades it’s been getting. As for this review, all I can say is, I tried my best.",10,default,"['favourites', 'cant-put-these-down', 'own', 'marchettaisagod', 'aussie', 'aussome']"

It has teenagers in it, but it isn't YA. I can't see teenagers enjoying it like they might enjoy Looking for Alibrandi, which in my opinion is the superior book. But I've realized that the Printz Award is awarded to books that adults wish teens would read, not necessarily those that they would enjoy. I'm not saying that Twilight should have gotten the 2006 Printz. Rather, I wish this book hadn't been marketed as YA, because it isn't.It took me two months to finish it. The first 100 pages are very difficult to read through the first time around. I can't imagine most teens finishing the book, let alone getting past the first chapter. The story doesn't pick up until 1/3rd of the way through. Pacing is a major issue. Honestly, I wouldn't have finished this if I hadn't read Marchetta's debut. And the unabashed praise surrounding Marchetta was also persuaded me to stick through to the end. As a protagonist, Taylor is functional. She's neither brilliant nor depressing. She just exists, and I guess that's part of the problem. She doesn't have a well pronounced voice. Jossie, from Looking for Alibrandi, had a voice. Taylor has a whisper. She isn't memorable, which is why I wasn't running to finish Jellicoe.I didn't like Jonah Griggs. I heard some of you scream in anguish. Sorry, but it's true. Sure, he was throwing himself a constant pity party, and he was supposed to be ridiculously handsome, but I didn't like him. Much like I didn't like Jacob in Looking for Alibrandi, I didn't like Jonah Griggs. Their romance was kind of bleh. Their relationship rubbed me the wrong way.The inter-weaved plot lines didn't work for me. I would have rather Marchetta focused on either Taylor or Hannah. Both didn't work for me. Also, the family plot line and the territory plot line were a random fit. What did one have to do with the other? Favorite character: Either Ben, Chaz, or Sam. Sam's story, and consequently Taylor's backstory, was really grating. I would have rather the novel focused on them. That, I thought, was sad, not Jonah's tragic abuse story. I hate when characters are excused for their actions because of their tragic pasts. 2.5 stars. This wasn't for me. ",10,default,[]

Melina Marchetta has a masterful way with words. Her writing is simple and yet effective. She’s down to earth, whilst being thought provoking. Lamb dressed as mutton. I could go into a plot summary for you, but I think it would ruin the experience; therefore, I’ll say this:There is a story within a story that inevitably intertwines the past to the present, and both are vivid and remarkably told. The dust jacket and/or blubs will present this book as a mystery, but to be frank, that’s a bit false. All mystery dissipates 150 pages in, with the first 50 pages being a bit of a confusing mess. I’ll admit, I had my doubts about Jellicoe Road in the beginning. The narrative hops around way too often, in no seeming order, and there were times when I had no idea who was speaking. But I pressed on, hoping that the story would reveal itself in time if I could only endure for a little longer. I’ll note here that Marchetta has this way of luring you in against your will. In this instance, I was compelled by Taylor Markham, even though there were times that I was a bit put out with her. She’s just so lost, so solitary, so angry and she’s been so betrayed. You want to slap her, then give her a hug. Though, as Marchetta has proven with her other works, her narrator is never the only character to shine albeit they shine through a rain cloud as her characters are almost always emotional train wrecks. Nevertheless, everyone is complex in their own unique, intriguing way. You get the sense that these people exist, somewhere along the Jellicoe Road. Their stories begin to feel like your experiences, their pasts become your memories. You can’t help but fall a little in love with them.All in all, Jellicoe Road won a Printz Award for good reason, and if you can just stick it out for 50 trying pages, you will be more than well compensated.",10,default,['2010']

It is Australian Melina Marchetta's third book and the first of hers I've read. A fault that will have to be remedied quickly as I absolutely loved this knotty, painful, beautiful book. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School--a backwoods boarding school located somewhere in Australia. Abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, Taylor was taken in by a mysterious woman named Hannah and installed at the school. Now eighteen, Taylor is embroiled in turf wars between the Jellicoe students, the Townies, and the Cadets. But when Hannah up and leaves without a word, Taylor is convinced it has something to do with her mother and with a horrific accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road twenty-two years before. Past and present become harder to discern as the story unfolds. Simultaneously obsessed with and terrified of finding out what happened and just how closely it is tied to her own fragmented life, Taylor is forced to form alliances with the leaders of her rival gangs, including Cadet leader Jonah Griggs with whom she shares a confusing and painful history. This story grabbed me by the throat and shook me until I begged for mercy. Parts of it read almost stream of consciousness and you have to just let it wash over you as characters and histories distill and become clearer on the page and in your mind at about the same pace they do for Taylor herself. And by the time the wars really begin, you are so invested it's impossible to extricate yourself from the world Marchetta has created. Fortunately you don't want to. I was charmed by the dust and heat of the Australian summer, the layered language with its overtones of fear and longing, and the periodic chapters detailing the story of five children who were determined to survive after the world ended. This book will both stop your heart and then remind you how to breathe again. It's gorgeous and deserves every accolade it gets.",10,default,"['ya', 'belovedbookshelf', 'girls-who-do-things']"

Stunning.''It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la.''Jellicoe Road is a story about grief, love and family ties. (In an unusual way, I guess.) It follows two different story arcs. One being Taylor's life in a boarding school, and the constant territory wars between the townies, the cadets and the kids who attend the boarding school.The second arc follows a story about 5 kids, which Hannah, who is Taylor's 'guardian', tells her about. What this story is actually about, and how it ties in with Taylor's story, you have to find out for yourselves! At the beginning I was kind of confused by all of this, but that still didn't take from my reading experience. I was glued to the pages, even though I had a hard time figuring out what is going on.That's how amazing Melina Marchetta's writing style is.Breathtaking, beautiful, captivating.Sounds strange, but I feel like this woman totally got me! I've waited for a story like this for so long!The whole scenery and setting were right up my alley. The characters were SO real. I felt like I was there. With them.

We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.

This is Printz prize winner, which many have said is a clear indication of YA greatness.Taylor Markham is among the senior students of a boarding school, and the novel opens as she is given more leadership responsibilities to fight the Townies and Cadets, all of whose borders seem to intersect. All the teens take the rules and territories with utmost seriousness, the way teens do. This premise was a bit confusing to me as a reader at times, because it was hard to visualize some of the landscape (and do Cadets always live in tents?)Taylor's Mom abandoned her when she was 11, and she's lived at the school ever since (so here's the YA orphanish trope) but she's been looked after by a woman living at the school named Hannah. Hannah has her own book about a group of teenaged friends that Taylor starts to read, and it starts playing an even more important part in the story. And then Hannah disappears.And then there are serial killers and mysterious brigadiers and drug addicts and prostitutes.I felt it was a little uneven in the storytelling, to the extent that some of the characters lacked a certain realism. I actually thought the best parts were Taylor's connections with other people; the author is able to capture that heightened, ""this matters more than anything else so far in my life"" feeling, and also the inevitability of some relationships.

Then in between chapters we get the second story told in third person that follows a group of friends after they share a traumatic experience. Over the book, these two stories merged in such a way that it will leave you speechless. And that is where the magic of this book lies.So why not five stars? To be honest, I had a really hard time getting into the book initially. Marchetta throws you in with little no background or explanations and there seemed to be no solid ground to grab onto. I didn't understand the townie vs cadets vs students war that was going on or how it was so violent with no consequences. And I also didn't warm up to Taylor right away. She's a very prickly character who seems to care for no one - not even herself. As the story goes on, we get to know more about her and eventually I understand her actions. It was a bold choice to start the novel this way and ultimately it's why I gave it four stars.My absolute favorite part of this story was the past glimpses.

""It was boring and confusing then confusing and weird and then it was weirdly beautiful. I cried."" I can't give this book five stars, no matter how much I liked the ending or how much a re-read helps because my first read of the first 2/3rds of the book wasn't a good experience. I forced myself to finish it and you should never feel that way about a five star book so here's a review, eyes wide open.Jellicoe Road tells two stories, separated by decades, and neither of them was initially compelling for me. The story the highly quotable opening lines come from the first, older story. The first story set events in motion that the second story relies on. Unfortunately Melina Marchetta tells the first story like an asshole. I'm sorry, I tried to think of a better way to put it, but even my best alternative was just a watered down rephrasing of the asshole sentiment. Marchetta deliberately muddles a complicated series of events. She constantly obscures how the stories connect. It became frustrating, felt unnecessary, and really detracted from my experience. To stop you from connecting the stories too fast the characters that appear in both stories have two names. Yeah, characters. If it had to be done then it should've only been done once. I enjoy thinking while I read, but I don't enjoy crossword puzzles either.I experienced a bit of name soup in each individual story. There were so many character's running back in Taylor's story, the present day story, that I sort of gave up. There are little girls running around all of whom Taylor is responsible for, other house heads, her friends, the townies, and the military camp group. When you tack on a secondary story with characters who have nicknames and unrevealed proper names it just became too much. I don't think it was me because I've been perfectly capable of keeping track of a large cast before. Also, I had similar feelings about the cast of Saving Francesca.Taylor's story involves the territory wars -- a game the students at the Jellicoe school play against the townies and the military school, but the game is taken very seriously for some reason. Since these games only go on while the military school is out there doing training I never felt the game was as life or death as it felt to the characters. They had to tolerate each other for six (or was it eight?) weeks a year. The fact that the wars were so temporary made me really uninterested in negotiations between the various factions. I didn't get why it was such a big deal for the townies to get access to ""the clubhouse"" if the military school would be gone in a few weeks. It felt like a frivolous thing to invest so many pages on and I could tell the author went back and forth a little on how important the 'wars' were. At one point Taylor marvels at being in a place for the first time in years because they'd lost the territory back then and at other points she says they only actually have to be careful while the military school is around... Well, which is it?The end of the book connects a lot of people and events. It made little snippets of conversation or things peppered through the book come together. Re-reading I saw more connective stuff like 'oh there's the purple notebook' and 'oh mention of the postman,' but I wish this stuff had stuck with me enough to enjoy it all at the conclusion. Of course, if I hadn't found so much of it bloody inane I might have begun to guess at the importance of certain things earlier.There are some timeline things that made no sense to me, like Jessa knowing about the tunnels. Her mother died when she was two and her father lived as a hermit in the woods for years afterward. She doesn't know he was the hermit or that he died. It's implied he didn't stick around long after her mother died because he was afraid of tainting her. Hannah found her in foster care and brought her to Jellicoe, yet somehow her father who had been out of her life for a significant period of time let her know there was a secret tunnel in her dorm building? Eh... No. Unlikely. There were several dorm buildings and her father never knew Jessa while she lived at the school so I think it's all just a little too unlikely.As for the characters, Marchetta made my heartbreak for Tate even though I hated her. She made me feel the tragedy in Hannah wanting to live even after her brother died. She made me want Jonah for Taylor and Hannah's happy ending. I cried more than a little over an apology that needed no forgiveness and the author made the unfinished house from the beginning of the novel into a dream for me too. The conclusions of the book, even the serial killer story, made the rest of the novel worthwhile, but it doesn't blind me to the flaws or how difficult it was for me to slog through some of it. I think it's a good book, but unfortunately I didn't have a religious experience over it.",9,default,"['coming-of-age', 'gloomy', 'romance', 'young-adult', 'better-than-i-expected', 'printz']"

It’s teasing me, asking me to open it right back up again so I dip my head into the strong, lyrical verses of Marchetta’s writing so I can fall in love and hate with the characters all over again.Taylor Markham is a confused young woman. She was dropped off at some random 7-Eleven when she was just a kid by her druggie mother, and once she left the washrooms, was taken to the Jellicoe School by this woman who, throughout Taylor’s life, becomes the closest thing she has to a mother. But Taylor’s life at the Jellicoe School isn’t so great. Most of the children who attend don’t have families and are there because they’ve got nowhere else to go. Not to mention to territory wars between the two other sects of that area. (Note: this is where I comment on the confusion that takes place in the first 100 pages. Don’t worry; it all clears up later.) Taylor becomes the leader of the territory wars when she’s seventeen, a senior, and months away from graduating, it is finally when life begins to get even more complicated.Taylor was such a strong heroine. Some didn’t like her very much, but I found her voice to be true to her situation and found her quite accurately filling out the shoes for someone in her position. Her actions really made me think – most of the time, it seemed, she was performing an action over talking, but everything she did sufficed in making her life seem believable. At some points in the story, she made me feel like throwing myself in front of a zooming train for her, and during other points, I felt like hugging her to my chest to stop her breaking sobs.Griggs was so magical, so loving and heartbreaking and loyal and fantastic…I couldn’t breathe whenever he spoke. He had some of the most romantic lines I’ve ever read in my entire life, and forgive me, Taylor, but I was just so jealous of you. Griggs was everything you look for in a romantic partner, and even though he had his flaws, he seemed complete to me. Although Marchetta never went out and said he was extremely handsome or anything like that, the way I looked at him was with a blurry line crossing from beautiful to just an average guy whose heart could beat, too, and I loved seeing him like that. The supporting characters were so fabulous, and I’m talking about everyone who was anyone in this book. From Ben to the Mullet Brothers, I was happy (or furious, whichever it called for) with everyone. Although this story was told from Taylor’s POV, a key plot of this book was with a cast one generation older, the cast that makes up everything Taylor needs. I won’t spoil this review in giving away any details, but those supporting characters, and the story they had to share, was absolutely indescribable, and I cried and laughed along with them in turn.Earlier on in this review, I said that there were some foggy, slow part in the book that made others put this down. Although I never really found the story to be moving on too slowly, I will say this book, no matter how beautiful, is not for the impatient. The first 120 pages, before the book really begins to shine, is confusing, muddy, and although well written, just as mind boggling as the emotions that run through Taylor’s body the entire book. Warning: this book also isn’t for those who hate the heavy. Reading this is like dropping a box of hardcover books onto your back and then having to cross a desert with them there – it’s tear-jerking, unexpected, romantic, mysterious and questionable.I loved this book with all my heart and feel like, although I just finished it, reading it again to pick on all those little lines again. The highest praise I can give ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is a five-star rating, but even so, I wish it was more. More like a hundred. JELLICOE ROAD, without telling a lie, is the best book I have ever read, and is absolutely recommended. *Because this book had so many fantastic lines, I’ll share one shining quote with you, the one that stood out the most.“He shakes his head and, although it’s dark, I can tell he’s crying.‘What are you thinking?’ I whisper after a while.‘That you deserve romance,’ he says.Page 237On the Jellicoe Road by Melina MarchettaAudience: 14+ (sex, drugs, alcohol, suicide, and some older youth audience reading)Rating: 5/5 Recommend?: Yes in all languages.

here!
Here's a funny story I want to insert before I write the real review: when I first heard of Jellicoe Road, I immediately thought of that song from the musical Cats, ""...because Jellicoes are and Jellicoes do, Jellicoes do and Jellicoes would..."" I Googled the lyrics and looked for it in Youtube, feeling so cool that I remembered the song and everything, and then I realized it was JELLICLE, not Jellicoe. *facepalm* (By the way, if you're reading this from my blog, I inserted the video of the song below, just in case you want to hear it too! Careful, it gets quite catchy.)Totally unrelated (though hopefully funny) story aside, here's the review! (You: Finally!)Jellicoe Road by Australian author Melina Marchetta is set as a dual narrative, a technique which I have loved ever since I read Holes. It starts out sort of like a puddle of string, entangled in itself, with you hardly knowing what to do with them, but somehow, somewhere along the book these little string ends start finding each other and connecting and forming something beautiful and perfect that absolutely makes sense. It's hard to understand my explanation, but really, it's my subconscious channeling you to read it stat. As you journey with Taylor and Co., everything seems complicated but wait until you read the final pages. Ahh, so that's why this happened. You may find the resolution a bit long, but it's okay because it ties up all the loose ends which leave you in no doubt regarding the fates of the characters, while maintaining a little ambiguity as you wonder what happens to them beyond the book's scope.Feelings-wise, I think this book is so... passionate. Powerful. Intense. It comes across to me that way, not because of the vivid imagery or the intricate plot, but because of all the emotions the characters are feeling. I measure a book by how it evokes feelings in me, and this book takes home all the awards because I think it made me feel everything I could possibly feel at my age. I read this at the end of my college summer semester, where I felt like a prune, numb and empty from all the schoolwork and literally sleepless nights, but this book managed to make me feel good, which is not at all unwelcome (I'm like a grape now. Sorry for the food analogy, I just want to eat some grapes.) Wow, Marchetta.Also, Taylor Markham and Jonah Griggs both possess strong personalities, which definitely adds to the passion + tension + overall intensity of the story in a lot of ways. It makes for an interesting dynamic.But here's the thing: what really did me in was the prose. Marchetta's writing contains a flowy, dreamlike quality that is part witty and part poignant, among other things. It's an interesting combination that manifests itself several times in the text. Like this quote, for example:And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you're watching someone die. But there's a joy and an abundance of everything, like information and laughter and summer weather and so many stories.There are several others, believe me, but I didn't have the foresight to write them down because I was too busy reading everything that I finished the book in a day. It is THAT good. If it is not obvious yet, Jellicoe Road is something I DEFINITELY recommend you to read! The experience is nothing short of magical, as all dreams are, no matter bad or good. :)",9,default,"['2012', '5-stars', 'owned', 'young-adult', 'award-winning']"

It's not like my thoughts on the book have much sway on fellow readers. Original post  here.The connection? No, it wasn't all that difficult to figure out. In fact, I had fun with it. It's just like the matching type examinations in school, way back when. I appreciated the mystery and the hint of suspense, of course. It's one aspect of fiction that I thrive in. And even if I did figure out early on that Melina Marchetta was actually narrating two stories - one from the past, one from the present - and that they will eventually tie up in the end, I enjoyed reading this nonetheless. Jellicoe Road is a heartwarming story about friendship, family, love, death and loss, coming to terms with life's trials, and the ties that bind ~ all the important things that transcend time, space and distance. It's what I truly appreciated about the novel, actually. The author begins the story with something just a tad trivial - territory wars - and then comes out strong in the end with all the stuff that matter. The first half is a meandering mess, but the storyline builds up somewhere in the middle so that by the time you get to the second half of the book, you'll be so hooked you'll be unable to put it down. :) Unfortunately, much as I would like to expound on my observations, I highly doubt that I could give an accurate description without revealing too much of the plot, and we really don't want that. Like Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go, this book is highly spoilery (is there such a word?), and I don't want to be the one to kill the fun. The writing wasn't exceptional, but I liked its simplicity and straightforwardness. The characters? Well, there were times when I thought Taylor Markham was such a drama queen, but then I try to put myself in her shoes, and while I know I can never relate to her, I think I can comprehend where all the angst was coming from. Jonah Griggs would never be a ""literary crush"" in a million years, but he is perfect for Taylor, and they sincerely deserved each other. Everyone else - Raffaela, Chaz, Hannah, the Brigadier, etc. - were secondary personalities that helped build and shape Taylor's character. The Great Reveal - well, more like Great Reveal in Installments - didn't shock me as much as I thought it would, however. I think that I read through the chapters more for the purpose of confirming what I already know, and it didn't really blow me away. Still, it tugged at my emotions; the realizations and acknowledgments in the end broke my heart, and I appreciated people's histories and how these can change lives, in a major way. Because, more than anything, Jellicoe Road is Taylor Markham's journey to self-discovery, and the story of acceptance of the people around her.

I'm formally changing my 4 star rating to a 5 star one. I also still love Jonah Griggs with my entire heart.
It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, 'What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?' and my father said, 'Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,' and that was the last thing he ever said.
It's hard to review a book that you really like because it's so difficult to give it the justice it deserves. Melina Marchetta is an incredibly underrated author, who has a gift for crafting realistic voices for her teen characters. Her characters are flawed and she puts them through the emotional wringer, but Marchetta never allows it to get melodramatic. There's a perfect balance of the exploration of family, friendship, and romance. Marchetta's prose is absolutely beautiful. Seriously, I have so many lines highlighted on my Kobo. I don't really know what to say other than how I loved creatively and beautifully Marchetta wove all of her characters together. All of them are connected in some way, and go on their own emotional journeys. No character in this novel is left one-dimensional. Plus Jonah Griggs is a new favourite literary boy of mine. Just saying. 
Some of my favourite quotes:
“Taylor Markham,"" said Raffaela, ""I'm going to say a prayer for you."" And although I wanted to mock her and explain I didn't believe in anything or anyone, I realised that no one had ever prayed for me before. So I let her.”According to Dickens, the first rule of human nature is self-preservation and when I forgive him for writing a character as pathetic as Oliver Twist, I'll thank him for the advice.“So apart from writing letters home to your fantasy girlfriends,""Ben says, walking backwards, ""what do you guys do out here without television and phones?""""Men's business. Bit confidential,"" Griggs says patronizingly.""Wow, wish I were you,"" Ben says, shaking his head with mock regret. ""All I'll be doing tonight is hanging out in Taylor's bedroom, lying on her bed, sharing my earphones with her, hoping she won't hog all the room because it's such a tiny space.”“What are you so sad about? We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.”",9,default,"['young-adult', 'reviewed', 'standalone', 'own-as-ebook', 'get-your-tissues', 'awesome-heroine', 'awesome-hero', '5-star-reads', 'band-of-friends', 'tw-sexual-assault']"

I already know I'm not going to do it justice...so bare with me, as I try not to butcher it.Jellicoe Road is the past and present coming together to create one manginificently beautiful tale, full of grief and heartache and hope.I'm not gonna lie, this book is a hard hard read. If it's not the interlacing of two different stories, then it's the tragedies that these characters, from two different times, face. Trust me, the writing is pretty much impeccable. The bits of story we get about the past are confusing because Marchetta wants them to be...it's all part of the suspense of the book and ultimately adds to the climax of it. I think the confusion is really just mystery and gives us suspense.I would compare this book to a psychological thriller film. It's one of those where you're like, ""Am I supposed to know what's going on? Because I'm completely lost. Or stupid."" But then at the END it all comes together and makes perfect sense and you can't believe you were oblivious to the brilliance occuring right in fron of you because the whole thing has been amazing!!!!!After I read this, I layed in bed like a comatose patient, unable to move due to an incredible overdose of grief and sadness. It's not that the book has a sad ending, it's just that when I reflected on EVERYTHING these characters had to go through I felt miserable for them. Another confession....I sobbed. Horribly. At least 3 times in this book.It was really an emotional journey that I went on with this book, as cheesy as that may sound to anyone....it's true. A raw, emotional, exhausting journey. This was a hard read because of the content, but worth it and an extremely compelling journey. Seriously, my new favorite book.So do myself, and yourself, and Melinca Marchetta a favor and go out right this minute and buy this book. Lock yourself away and fall into the world of the characters who live on Jellicoe Road.",9,default,"['absolute-favorites', 'books-that-moved-me', 'contemporary-ya']"

 5 AMAZING STARS!
 Quite easy one of the best books I've read this year!
“I live on the Jellicoe Road. Where trees make canopies overhead and where you can sit at the top of them and see forever. My aunt built me a house there. Remember that.”
 Now and then I come across some little book that not everyone is raving about, definitely not the book of the month. It catches my attention when one of my friends is reading it, I add it to my TBR list and soon I forget about it. Few months later it catches my eye again and I do wonder when will I start it. Some other flavour of the month book comes to the scene and once again I let it go. I easily get caught in this race and little gems like this book get forgotten in the never ending TBR pile, but then comes one day when I'm tired and a bit disappointed by these popular books, let down by the hype and reach for the book that has been forgotten.What a revelation! I started reading and instantly loved it. I got invested in it and just couldn't put it down. I got caught in a magical whirlwind and lost myself in a brilliant story. I got emotional, sad, sentimental, I was touched deep down and through teary eyes I reminisced about life, love, friendships, memories and didn't want this book to end, ever. I felt I knew the characters, I felt part of their existence, I wanted to leap into the pages and give them all a big hug and whisper something, anything. These are the signs of a good book for me. I couldn't put it down, I got so involved I lived and breathed with them all, I kept reading and losing myself regardless of the life still going on around me, but at the same time I didn't want the story to end. 
 “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.” 
 Well, let me tell you, this book was definitely a  Journey!This book will have a special place in my heart.",9,default,['top-tbr']

This is a frequently five starred novel, but I think I went into this with all the wrong expectations.The story follows a girl named Taylor Markham who was abandoned by her mother. She is the leader of her house in their war games (a significant plot in the novel), which is complicated by her blossoming romance with Jonah, one of the other leaders. On top of that, the person Taylor is closest to, Hannah, has disappeared, leaving behind snippets of her novel which may contain more truth than fiction.I guess I just assumed this was a contemporary novel written in a normal format, but the way the narrative was structured was extremely confusing to me. Hannah’s story is interspersed with Taylor’s, and for most of the novel I had no clue what the point of Hannah’s story was. It comes together in the end, but as a reader who prefers a more linear format, the way the novel was presented just didn’t work for me.I can see where others got such enjoyment out of this book - it's a highly emotional story, but also ambiguous in a way that can be rewarding once you piece the story together.Despite its strong points, this one just wasn't for me. I personally didn't feel enough of a connection to the characters to feel invested. Coupled with the annoyingly confusing nature of the story, I didn’t get much enjoyment out of this.I also really hated the whole war games plot line - by far the least interesting part of the novel.I’ll say I’m kinda bummed that Jellicoe Road didn’t work for me, since it has been on my TBR for years and one I had always assumed would be a favorite once I actually got my hands on it.Recommended for patient readers who won’t mind being confused for a large portion of the story, as well as fans of YA contemporary that deals with heavy themes.",9,default,['2-star']

As a travel buddy, this book kept me awake. It failed to bore me long enough to leave it inside my bag. In fact, as I was trekking the mountains of Mambukal, I can't help but look for my own Jellicoe road, the type where the canopies of the nearby trees form a tunnel. The type where I would set my eyes on the five friends bonded by fate. Sadly, my gaze did not meet anyone with the eyes that seemed to belong to Narnie but it did not lack smiles through which for a brief moment I connected with. As days crept on, so did my curiosity for these five friends who, I believe are the real heroes and heroines of this novel. This is their history, present and future. Everything that made Jellicoe Road rich in amusing events and games were created by these fab five. Their presence have etched too deep into the hearts of the townpeople including the police, the mayor and etcetera that their lives seemed to eveolve aroudn them. Taylor, the supposed heroine of this story stood out as an important link in the completion of their fate. It felt like I prowled into Taylor's diary who was then retracing her heritage to cope with her identity crisis and occasionally bumping into those entries where she wrote about her crush/lover. I guess, if Marchetta did not explore the story of these five friends, Taylor's diary would be common.This is readable and enjoyable. It does not really evoke change in me or that type that makes me want to get up and run. But it does pinch you in your heart, enough to make you feel that any friendship is not perfect but it truly exist for anyone who wants to leave loneliness alone.",9,default,[]

I opened up to the first page and it was so heartachingly beautiful that a single tear slipped out of my eye. That was nothing compared to how I felt when I finished this. I was actually sobbing- you know the ugly crying where there tears and puffy eyes and snot and wailing? It’s gross but thats about what I looked like. This book is beautiful, emotional puzzle that you, as the reader, are able to piece together as the book progresses. I’ve honestly never read something so emotional in my life and I can’t find a way to express how happy I am that I picked this book up. I was confused, I laughed, I smiled, and as realization kicked in, I cried - oh God did I ever cry. This book changed my life in a way I didn’t completely believe books could. The story alternates between Taylors life at the Jellicoe school with the territory wars, which i’ll be honest are pretty confusing, and the story her guardian, for all intents and purposes, is writing about 5 young kids. I grew so attached to the story Narnie was writing and the kids in it. I loved Taylor and I loved Jonah and, oh gosh I just adored all of them. There wasn’t one character I didn’t like.It’s such a poetic novel. One minute nothing makes sense and the next it all makes sense and it will tear you up I can assure you of that. When I look at my friends reviews on goodreads a lot of you have it marked to-read and I’m telling you right now to stop procrastinating on it and read this book.

On the Jellicoe Road is technically a YA book, and certainly it is a coming-of-age story with adolescent characters. However, the term 'YA' somehow feels pejorative when describing this book because this story (these characters, this plot) just feels bigger than that. This is not a book for lazy readers. It is intricately plotted, weaving between the past and the present, and for the first 100 pages or so it's difficult to grasp all of the characters. The mystery is deliberate, though, and the reader is feeling the same confusion that the book's protagonist Taylor Markham does. Taylor is 17, and the reluctant head of house at a boarding school for children from troubled backgrounds. Her background is complicated, murky, painful; she was abandoned on the Jellicoe Road at age 11 by her drug-addicted mother. Hannah rescued her, but who is Hannah? Friend, guardian, substitute mother? Hannah lives in a half-built school by the river, next door to the school. At the beginning of this story, she disappears - leaving no explanation - and this is part of Taylor's emotional unravelling, but also the catalyst for a journey (both literal and figurative) of self-discovery.The Jellicoe Road School is somewhere out in the bush of Australia, but it borders a town. The Townie kids, the Cadets and the boarding school kids have been engaged for decades in a complicated turf war. There are shades of the Outsiders in this aspect of the novel, although it's not nearly so much about poverty/class - and nor are the divisions between the three groups so insurmountable. Indeed, Taylor has a complicated history with Jonah Griggs - the leader of the Cadets; and her best friend Raffy (a Townie) has a complicated history with Chaz Santangelo, the leader of the Townies. At first I wasn't convinced about this aspect of the plot - I was afraid of a 'Lord of the Flies' scenario - but it is handled so deftly, and Marchetta connects it to the past in a way that is immensely satisfying. The book begins with an accident on the Jellicoe Road: two cars are in a head-on collision, and two families are nearly wiped out. If you do read this book, read this passage carefully. Read it several times, and commit it to memory. The past storyline and the present storyline merge together in a way that is, frankly, ingenious. The emotional impact of it is intense. About halfway though the book, as I began to make connections and predictions, I became intensely invested in Taylor's journey in figuring out who she is and how she is connected to the other characters. In many ways, this is a tragic book; nearly all of the characters in the book are damaged, and it is beyond what is realistic to for them to be made completely whole again. However, it is also a hopeful book - and it takes love, loyalty and friendship very seriously. Adolescence is an emotionally intense time anyway, and this book understands that and gives the reader emotionally intensity which is both authentic and earned. Highly, highly recommended. Marchetta is one of my favourite YA authors, and this book deserves 'classic' status.

The only other five-star book I read in 2012 was Once Was Lost, and that was way back at the beginning of the year-- so I guess you could say I was overdue for an amazing read. In lieu of writing a normal review, I thought I'd make a list of the ten moments or... aspects, I guess, that lingered or stood out in some way. Because, as anyone who's read this book knows, Jellicoe Road is so beautiful and haunting that writing a regular review of it is far too daunting a task. (I didn't include any real spoilers in the review, but I did put some stuff under spoiler tags just to preserve the reading experience as much as possible-- if you click them, it won't ruin the ending or anything.) So without further ado, here are the ten things that, a week after reading, my mind still won't let go of.10. Poor Sam. He breaks my heart, especially because he's probably only 14 or 15 years old himself-- this boy is in desperate need of some help. His role in the book is minimal, but his impact was not.9. Santangelo. (You will be seeing quite a few secondary characters on this list.) His evolution over the course of the novel was natural and gorgeous. I knew from almost the moment he was introduced that I would be keeping an eye on him, and my how that paid off!(view spoiler)[Favorite Santangelo moment:""It's like when I was in year eight and we had to study The Diary of Anne Frank. I mean, she died of typhoid. Can you believe it? How could Anne Frank die of typhoid? The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying, and it was like nothing could kill what was inside of her. I thought, okay, maybe a gas chamber or a firing squad could kill her but not an illness that other people survived.""I'm very disturbed to find out that the leader of the Townies has a soul and I'm beginning to develop a bit of a crush on him.Me, too, Taylor. (hide spoiler)]8. The Prayer Tree. I found it to be a symbol of home for many of the characters, especially Taylor and Raffy. It was a marker of the past and, somehow, the characters were able to connect at the Prayer Tree in a way that they couldn't elsewhere. It brought people together, even when time and prejudice seemed to separate them.7. This quote.He's the most beautiful creature I have ever seen and it's not about his face but the life force I can see in him. It's the smile and the pure promise of everything he has to offer. Like he's saying, ""Here I am, world; are you ready for so much passion and beauty and goodness and love and every other word that should be in the dictionary under the word life?"" Except the boy is dead... It makes me want to yell at the God that I wish I didn't believe in. For hogging him all to himself. I want to say, You greedy God. Give him back. I needed him here.This is probably the moment where the tears started forming, and they never really went away.6. I already mentioned Santangelo, but I have not yet dwelt on Raffy. She was a wonderful friend to Taylor, and even more than that I loved watching Raffy and Santangelo's interactions. Loved. Marchetta never clearly spelled out what their history was, but in the end I don't think that was the point. When Santangelo ate Raffy's pickles, I swooned a little. (There's something I never thought I'd say.) 5. The fifth tin. I hate it.4. Oh my oh my the friendships in this book made my little heart melt. There was the perfect mix of hilarious camaraderie and touching earnestness. (view spoiler)[Hilarious camaraderie:""We can give you a lift,"" [Santangelo] says grudgingly. Griggs is looking straight ahead as if he doesn't give a shit.""But just say we get finger marks on the seats?"" I ask. ""Can we borrow your hanky?""Raffy and I are both amused by my humour.""Just don't touch anything.""Touching earnestness:Do I remember what Raffaela said in the car park of the Evangelical church?""Who do I believe in?"" she had repeated as if it was the dumbest question she'd ever heard. ""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""So beautiful. The interactions of Taylor, Jonah, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben made me alternately laugh and sigh. (hide spoiler)] 3. Taylor's voice was unique and I loved being in her head. She has this wry sense of humor that is so engaging, and I was quite drawn to her no-nonsense attitude, prickly personality, and the way she tried to suppress her own longings. 2. The magical realism of Taylor's dreams was just... gah. So good. The boy in the tree, the wailing-- it was all so haunting and really got under my skin.1. Hee hee... this will strike most of you as a strange favorite aspect of the book, but for some reason I was drawn to the silly little rivalry between Griggs and Ben. I think it was because they both were important to Taylor, yet had completely different personalities, Jonah being self-contained and intense, Ben being sarcastic and self-deprecating. (Loved. Ben.) There is nothing I would love more than to see a burgeoning bromance between these fine young men.(view spoiler)[For this reason, one of my favorite, favorite parts of the book was when Griggs saw Ben playing the violin and kinda-sorta apologized for messing up his fingers earlier. Hello there, let me just type out the entire exchange because it lights up my soul.When it's time for Ben to play his solo-- his eyes closed, his mind anywhere but here, his fingers so taut and precise that it almost looks painful-- my eyes well with tears. Because you know from the look on Ben's face that he's somewhere you want to be... The place goes off. I can feel Griggs's shoulder against mine and I hear him mutter something under his breath.""What?"" I say, irritated. ""He's fantastic.""There's a look on his face that I don't recognise and I don't quite get it until Ben jumps off the stage, surrounded by Townie girls.""Hey!"" Griggs calls out to him. ""Violin guy!""Ben points to himself with that who me? look, walking towards us.Griggs doesn't say anything for a moment, but then he clears his throat. ""If I had known... I wouldn't have gone for your fingers that time.""D'awwwww.Also, in my frenzy of obsession upon finishing the book I read tons of interviews from MM. In one, she delivered this shocking revelation: Ben and Jonah will one day be roommates. I read that and then fell over dead with cuteness and wonder. Goodbye everybody, I must go pray fervently for a short story to someday be published detailing their life and times together in Waterloo. Ahhhh.

I'm not articulate enough but still, let me try. Melina Marchetta has written a book about two sets of young people who have lost much in life. Taylor Markham is abandoned by her mother at eleven outside a 7/11, to be picked up by a complete stranger and placed in a boarding school called the Jellicoe School. She grows up having no identity because the two people who should give her one are gone. She spends the next six years being angry and aloof and not allowing herself to become too hopeful about good things. Narnie, Webb and Tate lose their parents at twelve when their cars collide in a terrible accident out on the Jellicoe road. They are left to fend for themselves, along with their new psycho-hero-friend Fitz and the ever reliable Jude. A tragic story for all of them and I was sad, I really was but I was surprised that the strongest emotion I felt was envy. I was envious of them. Not for having suffered so much, but for having each other. They are left alone with no one to guide them or love them. So they guide and love each other instead. What I love about Marchetta's writing, and I've loved it ever since reading Saving Francesca, is how harrowing her stories are but she smooths the edges of impact by doing it with gentle hands. Its subtle and simple but so painfully honest that its elegant. Its not fancy words but what she observes; its how she sees the world that makes her writing poetic, not necessarily the way she's telling her story. Taylor, and again I felt this way about Francesca and Tom in The Piper's Son, is a specific part of us. She's that quality that makes us react against those who care about us, that makes us push them away because we don't want to seem vulnerable. We piss them off but inside we're praying they see through it and realize that we do need help, and more than that, we're lonely and can't live without them. We throw everything we have at them but hope they'll be the ones to crack the walls we've trapped ourselves in. She's our anger, uncertainty and aloneness and yearning. And then Taylor does us a favor and she cracks. She breaks open completely and demands from the world everything she wants. She demands and takes and in then end, I hope she wins. I know this isn't making sense anymore so if you'd like to move on, feel free to leave me here. I'll keep going, if you don't mind, until I've unloaded all I have in my head and my chest because I just, have to. Marchetta writes an adolescence I wish I had the guts to have had. Her characters are so well-drawn. From Taylor, Raffaela, Santangelo and Jonah Griggs to Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude and Fitz...its quite a group to keep track of. But you do because when they come on the page, they're not characters but feelings. Sad feelings, a lot of the time, but strong and they won't let you forget them. To expose yourself in the way they do, what they reveal of themselves to each other is both admirable and enviable (that word again). Let's just say, its hard enough to do as an adult. I certainly didn't speak so unreservedly and meditatively about myself at that age. But I wish I had. It all comes back to this quote (which if you’re not too anal isn’t really a spoiler) (view spoiler)[
  
""We end up with the Townies and Cadets at the McDonald's on the highway at two in the morning. I look around at everyone and can't help thinking how normal we look and I don't think I've ever felt normal. I watch Raffy as she removes the pickles from her hamburger and hands them over to Santangelo without them exchanging a word, and I realize there is more to that relationship than spelling bees and being enemies. These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well that they can tell what I'm thinking. Jonah Griggs takes my hand under the table and links my fingers with his, and I know I would sacrifice almost anything to keep this state of mind, for the rest of the week at least.""

(hide spoiler)]. Its about belonging and I think that's ultimately what Marchetta is writing about. Don't get me wrong, this book is overflowing with serious life lessons. She talks about sacrifice, acceptance, redemption, guilt, keeping promises, perseverance, so many things. But belonging and solace, she says it right there in Chapter One. Throughout the story we find Taylor belonging more than she thought she did to people and places she never would've guessed. And the ending ends peacefully enough. As much peace that can be gotten from all the tragic events she puts her characters through.With all of that said, its not a perfect novel. But what is, I ask you. What is! Yes, like many complain, its a rocky start. But you survive. I love the opening lines so much that I would've endured a hundred more pages of jerky narrative. The plot was impressively tied together. The mysteries, however, weren't quite as mysterious. I would call many of the plot twists early on after which I would smack myself for my own damn cleverness. The territory wars...a melodramatic ploy, in my honest opinion. It was all a very long laugh that they took too seriously. But Taylor's inevitable connection to it later in the novel is sweetly satisfying. Another point to Marchetta's well-connected dots! This novel is just impossible to put down. Its not that you force yourself to stay awake, its more like you sit and read and forget to stop. You think a minute has gone by but suddenly you’re squinting your eyes because the light has dimmed. Has the sun set already? I still don’t know if Jellicoe is real, or if there is a Jellicoe school that served as inspiration for her novel, but all of these characters found something of themselves in this seemingly inconsequential town...to commemorate a place like that the way she does is amazing. Its as if any place in the world can suddenly be beautiful. I try to stay away from grand proclamations because I’m constantly changing my mind and so my feelings and opinions shift in kind, but such gestures are to be expected when you read someone as good as Melina Marchetta. So I’ll say this now, she’s my favourite young adult writer, full stop. A few come a very close second, like Malorie Blackman and Carolee Dean, both to whom I’m devoted after only one book and J.K. Rowling, of course. How can I not when she owns my entire childhood, which she keeps in pretty jars along with the rest of the childhoods of my generation? (Also, to be fair, I’ve only just this year started reading YA, so I’m sure there are hordes of other great authors for me to discover).And finally I think the reason why I love and envy Marchetta so much is that she writes compellingly the very stories I wish I could.",8,default,"['this-shelf-is-divine', 'identity-and-psychology', 'ok-fine-its-ya', 'goosebumps', 'hit-me-in-the-heart', 'own', '21st-cent']"

That’s the trouble when I read stories discussing the issues of teenagers. Good thing this book talked about values of friendship and family, or else I couldn’t find anything good to like about this book. I can imagine negative comments on this review, and yeah, bring it on.What I don’t like in the story:The reader will be introduced to the territory wars between the Townies and the Cadets, through the story telling of Taylor Markham. That is where most of the story will revolve. I don’t appreciate that part of the story; it’s like a stupid scheme to be implemented in a boarding school. I know it’s hard for me to relate on that side of the story since I didn’t get to live in a boarding school, but I’ve heard enough of the territory wars, even the small scale one. It may be a good component to a new storyline, but to be reading numerous chapters just to discuss about territory wars, which doesn’t have any strategic ideas against the other troop, only a story of falling in love with the enemy is tiring. It’s like I want to pull the hairs of the girls and pinch the boys on their sides to tell them to be serious on their business, and studies.Taylor will eventually search for her guardian, Hannah, which somehow confused me. She doesn’t seem to mind the existence of Hannah, so what’s with the sudden eagerness to find her? I think Taylor’s character is too dysfunctional that her emotional attachment to Hannah is as confusing as her character. It can be said that she’s trying to keep herself detached from anyone, but I hope she showed a little heart since she’s speaking in the story. It could be a positive side to the story telling, but I find it annoying. I know it’s only me.A boy in the tree, the Hermit, the Brigadier, Hannah, Jonah Griggs, the serial killer, Santangelo, the Prayer Tree, the Club house, the territory wars. They are all put together to create twist and confusion to the story, which eventually will be put in order as the story unfolds. Sounds exciting, it sounds thrilling, a page-turner one can say, but I say annoying, and trying-hard. I think the author tried too hard to put confusing aspects of the story to put suspense and mystery. It’s a good factor in the story telling, but I think it wasn’t written at the right place and time. I don’t know, I may be wrong, but that is what I feel. Throw stones on me now.Taylor’s coldness and stiffness annoyed me more. Her character is too cold, inside and out, that it’s kind of hard to understand her interest on other people’s business. Her concern on Hannah looks fake, and her falling in love with the enemy is stupid. She is also so eager to find her real parents, but her emotion was too shallow to understand her purpose.See, it’s hard for me to appreciate stories written about teenagers. I know I’m talking like I wasn’t a teenager once, but I am confident to say I wasn’t as annoying and stupid as these characters.What I like about the story:If I don’t like Taylor, then what three stars are for? It’s for the story of friendship and value of family that the story tackled.Italicized portion of the book will introduce the reader to another story. One may find it confusing, but only if you would not pay much attention to the early part of the story. Honestly, I like the italicized part better than the story of Taylor and her dysfunctional leadership in the territory wars.The italicized part is not just any story of a manuscript but a story taking account of one of the character’s story. I must say that part is well written and thank goodness to this part, the rest of Taylor’s silly storytelling was put in order. This part talks about the friendship of 5 friends from the boarding school, who originally started the territory wars. So, yes, it explains the silly territory wars the group of Taylor is engage into. The five friends were united by the accident in Jellicoe Road, and a friendship tight enough to keep them together started. The 5 friends experienced different issues in their younger years, but they remained supportive of each other. They grew up, lived a life away from each other but their lives are still tangled altogether. Their friendship keeps them connected at one point to another. And that is what I appreciate in this story. I remember my friends, and the unwritten rule of loyalty we once made. I remember the faces of my good friends who’ve been my confidantes since grade school, my close friends from the teenage years, and those I met in the University. This part of the book is close to my heart. It’s a rare gem to find friends who will stay with you up to the end. The friends who will remain by your side to lift you up when you’re down. And the italicized part didn’t fail to convey that heartwarming message of friendship and importance of family.I feel the need to acknowledged Manchetta’s effort to intertwine the story of 5 friends to Taylor’s own story. There are twist and turns, suspense and intrigued, and practically the end eventually justified the means. Though I still can’t help but hope that Taylor’s character was given more depth, and I know there’s a better way to tell us the connection of the 5 friends and Taylor’s life. I really find the emotions I feel for Taylor’s character were too shallow, for me to even appreciate her existence to the storyline.",8,default,['the-child-in-me']

This is one of her books, that has been heaped with praise, so I thought it would be a great next book.I must say, the book was a journey, for both me and the characters. I went from ""this is weird"" to ""what the heck is happening"" to ""THIS IS AMAZING!"". There was this beautiful story of connection, forgiveness, love, and friendship wrapped up in a mystery. Taylor had been abandoned on Jellicoe Road at age eleven, and more or less, cared for by Hannah, whose disappearance set the whole story in motion. In her search, Taylor found Hannah's manuscript, and though it seemed random at the time, she was soon able to draw parallels between the fictional lives of the characters and her own.At the same time, Taylor was leading her team in the annual boundary battle between her school, the townies, and the cadets. Alliances formed, and grew into something quite wonderful. These unlikely friendships brought me so much happiness, and it meant a lot to me, that Taylor found her people.As Taylor found more and more clues in her search for Hannah, I watched all the pieces fall into place, and then, all the feels were unleashed on me. Once it started, I couldn't stop the avalanche of emotions that began filling me up. There were lots of tears as it all became clearer, but there was a lot of joy in there too.I had to be patient, and let Marchetta lay the foundation for this wonderful tale.

Now about the book and how I felt while and after reading. I was looking forward to read this book for ages. I had read so many 5-star reviews to this book that it never occured to me that I could be not charmed by it. The weird thing is, I tried to love it. I honestly did my best to find a way into the story and warm up for the characters and learn to love and suffer with them. Unfortunately, I didn't find my way into the story. The first 100 pages or so were meant to be confusing, well, to me they weren't. I sensed such a connection after, like 50 pages, and when everything came clear I just inwardly nodded and shrugged, because it was a bit obvious to me, really. Why else would an author connect two stories like that? And why else make them so ""tragic""? The two main story-lines seemed a bit weak to me, by the way. I was highly annoyed with the war games. They seemed pathetic and useless to me, because well, they really had no use except for bringing Taylor and Griggs together. I actually wondered how people come up with such stupid games and ideas, while reading, I wondered whether there are people in the real world who act the way the characters acted. If such people exist I am persuaded that I should avoid these people, for otherwise the urge to strangle somebody may turn out to be stronger than my self-control. Taylor was pathetic. To me she was just pathetic and that's absolutely it. One second she was all analytic and serious and icy and the next she turned into an 'emotional' mess who hid somewhere in the corner. She was chewing on her 'problems' the whole bloody time instead of doing something, or accepting the past and getting over it and just living. It felt like Taylor was walking circles over and over again and I just wanted to slap her, hard, and walk away. What use is there from moping over your ""terrible-terrible"" life in your room? There is the world, there are responsibilities, things that have to be done.Her relationship with Griggs wasn't any better. It was 
beyond weird
 and completely unrealistic to me. No real romance, and definitely no chemistry at all. Hannah could have acted in a more grown-up manner too, but well, I didn't judge her. As for the other characters... Well, they weren't anything special, expect maybe the one who was always mentioned and remembered, but never appeared. I couldn't make out a real plot in this book. Just a story moving really really really slow. I wasn't exactly bored, but I was 
impatient
 and just wanted it to end as soon as possible after about 70% of the book. Exasperated. That's the word for how I felt. To the majority of the people the write style of this author seems magical, amazing...whatever. To me it is forced, difficult to swallow and weird. It doesn't get me, I cannot get into a story with such a write style, it is like a dead text to me. The whole story with all its characters and places and descriptions and plot twists felt unrealistic, forced and 
'un-alive'
. As if the author tried hard to be unique and impressive and failed. I'm sorry, really, but the whole time while reading I felt either like shrugging or rolling my eyes. The face I made the most while reading (like 80% of the time): ",8,default,"['i-prefer-rum', 'hate-the-heroine']"

Little accidental foray into the YA world for me, and my feelings are mixed.I see why it can feel satisfying to gradually piece together a story from a set of ambiguous puzzle pieces; for me, though, it's a style that often makes me feel alienated. I usually like to be grabbed immediately and to feel like I'm living inside the book, not to find myself scratching my head and saying, ""What's happening here?"" And because I'm like that I often end up detaching from books like these and failing to figure things out, as much out of emotional distance as out of the book's actual ambiguity. Occasionally, though, the style works for me and I feel really brilliant for having solved the puzzle and satisfied that I stuck with the book. This particular experience fell right in the middle of those two poles. What appears to be the main plotline of the book is pretty unclear at first, and is interspersed with insets from an even murkier subplot where you really have no idea who's talking or what's happening. Of course, the two stories are connected and the hows and whys of that gradually unfold -- a little too gradually for my taste. To the book's credit, though, I did stick with it and was rewarded -- mostly -- by increasing clarity after the halfway point or so. I might reread it and appreciate it more the second time around, if I cared enough to do so.I will say that the plot, once it finally unfolded, was pretty brilliant. Some of the characters and their dilemmas were interesting, although I never really felt like I knew any of them well. The romance was a bit too crafted for my tastes; the guy was that oh-so-perfect balance of tough and sensitive, macho yet emotionally available for the heroine. Yawn. I also get a little tired of the whole I-want-you-but-I'm-too-proud-to-let-you-know-so-I'll-just-endure-my-own-private-heartbreak-until-someone-hits-me-over-the-head thing.I'm not usually a YA fan and this book didn't convert me, its merits notwithstanding.

Having been abandoned by her mother at age 11, her erratic, mercurial and depressed moods does not make her a favourite among leaders. When Hannah, her mentor and guardian disappears, Taylor is burdened with the anxiety and the numerous questions that come with it. To top off her worries, there is a territory war going on between the Townies (kids populating Jellicoe Road) and the Cadets, who visit for 6 weeks each year for training. In the search for answers, Taylor not only uncovers mysteries regarding her mother and Hannah, but begins to mature and develop her identity.Meanwhile, a story from the past of 5 friends, Webb, Jude, Fitz, Narnie and Tate, is being told. At first, these storylines seem completely irrelevant and unrelatable, but as the story develops, the past and present collide.Placed in the middle of a muddled town, Melina Marchetta left me completely baffled. However, in the midst of confusion and tragedy, the story continues to surge forward, and as questions were answered, I found myself lost in the captivating worlds of Jellicoe Road. Taylor’s coming of age is evident, especially after a beautiful, bittersweet ending. On the Jellicoe Road ends with life, identity, and characters, laughter, death and a road that will be remembered.This book is highly recommended for all. Melina Marchetta’s powerful use of words and breathtakingly beautiful moments differentiates good books from excellent, and will reside in your heart.",8,default,[]

This one's tricky to understand how I feel about it... On the one hand, the lyrical writing hits me deep in the feels many times and makes me laugh. I also feel so in awe of the complex plotting that Melina Marchetta did. On the other hand, the format/structure felt clunky and I couldn't really get into the story until about halfway in when I felt like I finally got at least a grip on how the dual narratives might connect. The idea of the territory wars then felt quite abandoned halfway through too, when I don't even know how I felt about this elaborate territory war game thing yet. But the twists were twisty surprising and the characters were quite diversely unique. I love the characters Raffy and Chaz, and Taylor was interesting. In the end I think the biggest thing that bugged me was how melodramatic the book was... It got too sad, like for the sake of inserting some drama into the story. Taylor cried so much, had panic attacks so much, and I couldn't balance her magical dreams with the forcefully realistic sadness. Great to see Melina Marchetta get ambitious and develop her writing, but for the book among all she has written that gets the most raved reviews, I definitely prefer her others. ",8,default,[]

I finished this book last night and I WEPT through the last few chapters! My heart has been ripped out of my chest. My God, this book! This book is BREATHTAKING! This book is a triumph! It is that truly rare gem that you know will forever redefine excellence in your mind, and every other “great” book will now be compared to, and you already know will likely pale in comparison to. This book is the BEST YA novel I have ever read. This book may be one of the best books I have EVER read in my LIFE!Honestly, I don’t have the words to describe the astonishing beauty that is this story and this prose. What a privilege it was to have this reading experience! What a privilege it was to know these characters! What a privilege it was to be captivated by this gorgeous prose! A friend of mine who’s an avid reader had been recommending this book to me for years! I wish I had listened to her much earlier! This book should have been my absolute priority! When I finally started reading it, I was very confused! I spent the first 25% of the book not knowing what is going on. In fact, I read the first 25% twice, in hopes of finding some important info I had missed the first time. Then I got very nervous that I’m not going to like the book because it doesn’t make sense and I’m going to disappoint my friend by going back and saying I have no idea what she liked about this book! O, Ye of Little Faith! I needn’t have worried one bit! Every single sentence here has a purpose. Every single piece of the puzzle will masterfully fall into place. It all comes together BEAUTIFULLY! I don’t really want to talk about the plot. In my opinion, it’s best to go into this book knowing as little as possible about it. And if you really need to know what the story is about, it’s been discussed in great detail by so many other reviewers. I’d rather talk about how it made me FEEL all the feelings. Suffice to say that the book explores some heavy themes, but at its heart, it is a coming of age story; a story about finding who you are and where you belong, and where you long to be. it’s a story about devastating heartbreak, loneliness, immense loss, but also resilience, the absolute healing power of friendships, the beauty of first love, and the places and people who make us feel like we are home.This book has a complex plot, one that is structured intricately. There are dual narratives and a large cast of characters. You could say there’s a lot going on, and the book is under 300 pages! But what you have to understand is that this is not your average run of the mill YA. You’re in the hands of a true genius! This is a rich and complicated tale. And it’s very sophisticated, both in the themes it explores, and in the art of storytelling. The author seamlessly moves between the dual narratives, and slowly, slowly, unravels the mystery elements and unspools the thread that will connect all the pieces.By the end, you’ll sit there, absolutely stunned. Not just by how the dual narratives come together perfectly and harmoniously, but by the small details, the subtle connections that truly take your breath away. You’ll come to find that nothing was wasted here. That every little comment, every tidbit of info, and every thought was there for a reason, and they all create such a tsunami of emotions within you! The prose is truly hauntingly beautiful. Melina Marchetta is an astonishing wordsmith! Few can do what she has done here! Very few!It is extraordinary how the author manages such a large cast of characters so masterfully. Every character is rich and three-dimensional, and I couldn’t help but to care about each and every one of them. God, I don’t remember having read many books where I fell so deeply in love with so many of the characters, even the minor ones. And the punchy dialogues! They were so real. I giggled reading some of them. But then again, I also cried many times, reading Taylor’s narration of her story. What an emotional rollercoaster this was!This book did something to me. It sliced through my heart, cut a piece of it, and stole it forever! This is a book I will never forget! One I suspect I will come back to again in the future. This book deserves to be read by all, and not just young adults. Not the likes of Twilight, which for some incomprehensible reason steals the spotlight. This is the caliber YA literature should be.I kneel before you  Melina Marchetta. You’ve bewitched me. You’ve somehow bottled up magic and served it up in this 300-page package. Thank you for this book! We are not worthy!5 shiny starts, but only because the GoodReads scale cannot do this book justice! P.S: I know this book was written before the age of hashtags on social media, but can we make this hashtag a thing? #JonahGriggsForever",7,default,[]

Melina Marchetta’s The Jellicoe Road was the first contemporary Young Adult novel I’ve read, and to be honest, I was not sure what to expect. The story started with a shock, the car accident involving the Schroeders and the Markhams, and I asked myself, will this be one of those sad and tragic stories? Then it was revealed that it was part of a manuscript that the narrator, Taylor Markham, was reading. The setting of Taylor’s world was quite unfamiliar: the school system in Australia, the Houses, the Townies and Cadets, some of the terminologies that were used, all of these for me needed a little of getting used to. I’ve already gone by the first 5 chapters yet I was still not sure how I can get into the story. I felt like an outsider looking in while reading Taylor’s narration and I was not sure if I really care what these kids were going through with their school struggles and seemingly pointless territory wars. My interest was more attuned to the manuscript: the story of Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude felt like it has a lot more grounding since I was a witness to the friendship they forged amidst a horrific tragedy. Then I was in the part in Taylor’s timeline where Hannah left suddenly and Taylor could no longer contain herself and she just needed to confront the principal about it. She revealed that she hated the thought of appearing weak in the eyes of the other students even though deep inside, she felt weak without Hannah. It felt like I understood Taylor a little bit for the first time, for who hasn’t even once in their lives hid what they were really feeling inside, pretending as if everything was ok.I thought there was an inverted contrast between the struggles of the Fab 5 in the manuscript and Taylor: For Taylor, who was having trouble trusting anyone because of her past, her life-question was: how can I trust anyone ever again? Those who were involved in the accident needed each other to survive. For Narnie and the rest, their life-question was: How can we live if we didn’t trust each other to hold us up? Thematically, I thought this was where both worlds would converge, that through friendship, they would find their own self-worth. But not everything’s as neat and ideal as I expected. The novel was dedicated to unfold tragedy after tragedy, and everything began to unravel because of the disappearance (and death) of Webb. Webb was the lynchpin of the Fab-5’s friendship, he was the one holding everyone up, the one who’s passion for life inspired them to continue living. Without him, the consequences were disastrous: Tate left suddenly, Fitz became crazy, Narnie and Judd both harbor guilty feelings about what happened.There was this scene where Narnie and Judd was talking in the river. Narnie said that if Webb disappeared, there will be no one left for her, and she felt she might disappear, and Judd was the only one who was making her feel that her existence has substance and reality. That was a beautiful portrayal about how friendship matters to some people: the presence of others, especially their connection to us, helps ground our existence, the glance of the friend confirms that we are alive, that we are somebody worth it worth it worth it!At first I was disappointed with how the story was progressing in the case of the 5 friends. I thought that in spite of their friendship, they were unable to see their own self-worth, that the friendship didn't give them the strength to survive and flourish. Especially Tate, I thought, how could she leave so suddenly, and how does that honor Webb’s death? Upon further reflection, that was what I wanted to see, but what was the novel actually trying to show? Instead of in spite of, I realized they were able to form friendships that could last a lifetime despite what they've been through. How much could we say about our own lives?It was obvious that there was a connection between the 5 and Taylor’s world. When all of these connections were slowly revealed, Taylor’s issue on trust was being put to the test. Jonah Griggs was her main gateway to recover that capacity to trust again, Raffy and Chaz were the supporting pillars of that gate. Truth be told, I was imagining what my impression is if I met Taylor in person. Without knowing her history, I probably wouldn’t like her because of her moods and attempts to push people away and piss them of in the process. This novel reminded me to always look at a person without judging eyes for we never know what his or her story is. I find the author’s writing style fascinating and frustrating at the same time, it was descriptively sparse and half-the-time muted, it is as if the reader was watching a scene outside a window draped with translucent curtains, never revealing the whole scenery, bending the light and obstructing small portions of the unfolding story. There were some things that the book was silent about that I would have loved to know: how did Taylor react when she was found out that Fitz was the one who killed her father? How did Tate react when she found out about this, or did she ever know? What was going on inside Narnie the whole time that she lost her brother, how did she manage to be strong all of a sudden?Another thing that I liked about the novel was the dream scenes that Taylor included in her narration. I thought dreaming in the novel was how the author showed that people we love who have already passed-on never really left us. A touching moment was when Fitz was finally reconciled with Webb through Taylor and her dream. It is as if to say, some friendships do endure even beyond this world. Even with all the tragedies and the traumas the characters endured throughout the novel, most especially Tate and her daughter, this is one of those books that ended so gracefully and satisfyingly. Taylor, who had trust issues from the start, dropped her insecurities and found the grace of forgiving her mom. Through the inevitable darkness of death, both daughter and mom found intimacy and freedom. Narnie, who had lost her ability to wonder after the car accident, through the healing of belongingness and friendship, finally regained that which speaks volumes: peace within herself and hope for the ever surprising renewal and enchanting journey towards tomorrow.Here are some of the lines in the novel that I really love:“See, I remember love. That’s what people don’t understand. And what I also remember is that in telling that tale to the Cadet on the train I got a glimpse of peace.” – Taylor“These people have history and I crave history. I crave someone knowing me so well they can tell what I’m thinking.” – Taylor“Webb was grinning. Tate, too. They always grinned in unison. Like they were thinking the same mind, sharing the same heart.” – Hannah Manuscript“And then you came along and you spoke to me and nobody had looked at me in the eye for years.” – Jonah talking to Taylor“And he knew that, but all his life he’d been treated like crap to the point that he believed that he was crap. He’d never done anything good and nobody had ever said anything positive to him. But that night, on the Jellicoe Road, it was like he was reborn. The lives he saved gave him purpose and he loved those kids more than anything.” Taylor telling the story of Fitz“I remember love. It’s what I have to keep on reminding myself. It’s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that’s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It’s not the pain they’re getting over, it’s the love.” – Taylor“Then we spoke about our dreams and how we always felt safe in them, no matter how bad everything else seemed.” – Taylor talking about the Hermit“I want to yell out to everyone, “It’s a game, these territory wars. They loved each other.” – Taylor“I’m here because of you. You’re my priority. Your happiness, in some fucked way, is tuned in to mine. Get that through your thick skull. Would I like it any other way? Hell, yes, but I don’t think that will be happening in my lifetime.” – Jonah to Taylor“But living in the heart of Narnie was the only home he had ever had. Deep down he knew he wasn’t enough to keep Narnie alive for the rest of her life. But he could try.” – Jude“What are you thinking?” I whisper after a while. “That you deserve romance,” he says.” Taylor and Jonah“Naw. You just have to belong. Long to be.” “By blood?” “By love,” Narnie said, without looking up. – Jude, Fitz and Narnie“If you close your eyes, you get to control your own darkness,” Jude tells Santangelo.“If I want more, I need to go and get it, demand it, take hold of it with all my might, and do the best I can with it.” – Taylor“I want to tell them that the brilliance of that memory of lying between them won’t be easily surpassed and that the stories of their love for each other touch me in a way I didn’t think possible.” – Taylor about Hannah and Jude“But my mother said she wouldn’t die until she had something to leave her daughter.” – Taylor about Tate",7,default,"['young-adult', '2012-reads']"

I don't think I'm satisfied with this. Will revise eventually, especially after I'm done with my rereading. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This feels more like a dream.Meet the tenacious Taylor Markham. She's a girl with issues. Not issues like who she's going to go to the dance with, nor like contemplating the next move in the chess game she's about to win, by the way. These are deep-seated issues, like looking for a mother in the drugged figure who changes her name every time they move, or facing a terrible lonesomeness amongst people she doesn't quite know to be a friend or a foe.This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like, to quote a song title, a beautiful disaster. I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow. Very raw, very deep. It cuts into the very soul; it's about that hidden side of us we don't want the world to see (and which it turns its back upon - ironically, sometimes just when we need it the most). This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side. Really, it's quite the emotional roller coaster - it will make you cry, laugh, cuss and dream, all in the same page.Essentially, this isn't a book that invites you to keep those rose-colored glasses on. This is a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. { Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical. }This is a book that doesn't seem like a book. This seems more like a very personal journal of a girl, trying in vain to keep herself sane. There is here some talk of the most sensitive subjects: teenage pregnancy, drugs, poverty, prostitution, murder, depression. These are, however, merely mentioned in course as seemingly everyday objects - which, in truth, they are. { This may also serve as a reminder that it never hurts to look twice at the dark alley or the sleeping figure on the train; they may very well be linked to us in a way we may never know. }However, as bleak as the world seems, Marchetta does offer us something to hold on to. It may be just a few words carved in the tallest tree, or a song quietly repeating in a dream, but there's always something good to look forward to behind the bad.There's always wonder.Other notes:I had *a lot of* problems with the storytelling (I believe that there could have been a better way of using foreshadowing), but the story itself - wow. Very raw, very deep. It cuts into the very soul; it's about that hidden side of us we don't want the world to see (and which it turns its back upon - ironically, sometimes just when we need it the most). This is definitely very intense, especially on the emotional side (get ready for a roller coaster there!).About halfway, I somehow felt that I didn't (or couldn't) like this book - but then I realized that it was because I saw a lot of parts in me here that I 1) shun today, and 2) tried (and trying!) hard to change. To see those little behaviors and feelings that used to be how I operated and felt suddenly made me understand that what I was going through, while I was in the same stage as Taylor (though, of course, not of her circumstances!), was not as unique as I thought. I wasn't alone in that sense, though I felt back then that I was. I disliked being brought back there - but, hey!, it's a coming-of-age story, so you really see negativity, uncertainty and inquiry at this time of life. Kudos to the author for showing this - every aspect of growing up, not just in terms of the physical.",7,default,[]

Those who are regular readers of Persnickety Snark know that I am a HUGE Melina Marchetta fan because she's a talented writer, she has created many intensely personal and real characters and I think she's the bee's knees as a human being as well. This is biased. But then again the Printz award, and the plethora of other awards she's won for this title and the others, show that (perhaps) I have exceptional taste.Jellicoe is my beloved. I adore it. I have read it many times and recently listened to it as my first ever audiobook experience. I can't objectively review it anymore. So instead of writing a proper review, I am writing down the twelve reasons I love it.1. At first it has a more confusing structure than the Christopher Nolan movie, Momento. Relax and let all the carefully crafted threads start weaving into a tapestry of awesomeness. The results? A scene that will squish your heart into minced meat. It also makes Jellicoe Road a fantastic book to re-read multiple times as you always pick up something new.2. Shows that tween girls really are terrifying and that they can make teen boys quake in their boots.3. All of Marchetta's boys are crushable. But she has a way with kissing scenes...don't believe me, check this out - ""When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don't know who is breathing for who, but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don't know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already."" Melting yet?4. Jonah Griggs, the MOST compelling tortured love interest in YA. He's not supernatural, he's just supernaturally divine. He's an ass, a joker, a tough nut, a sensitive soul and a great snogger. He's also kitted out in fatigues most of the time. He's perfection in his detailed imperfection. Only he could swear at a girl and still make you swoon.5. The band. Don't want to ruin it but if you've read the book you know why. Comic relief in mullet form.6. The past - heart wrenchingly awful and beautiful in one clearly imagined intro. The rest is gravy.7. Hannah - the heart of the book and one half of the soul of the book. Her story and that of the one she loves, is just....ahhhhh.8. Territory wars. Forget Hogwarts and Voldermort, that's child's play. See what happens when boarders, townies and cadets battle over territory. Enormously fun, sometimes brutal and a great use of the Aussie bush.9. Santangelo and Raffy. He might be a bully and a cad and a hardheaded mule but his bickering with Raffy cracks me up. He's a good sort and she's a fabulously strong, maternal, uncompromising chick in a completely different way than Taylor.10. The way in which grief, desertion and family are all integrated so beautifully with love, friendship, war and identity. Big ideas but delicately crafted.11. The boy in the tree.12. Taylor Markham.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book, and when it started I suspected a hint of dystopia, with weird dream-like interludes (because, seriously, it’s hard to find a YA book at the moment that’s not dystopian!). Not so. I'll admit the first few chapters are confusing and you may be tempted to put the book down - DON’T DO IT!!! It all becomes clear, and then you can sit back and enjoy the ride. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting (at 2am this morning in fact, which may explain why I'm having trouble stringing sentences together at the moment). The story is set around the life of Taylor Markham, the 17 year old newly elected ‘leader’ of a boarding school on Jellicoe Road. Taylor was abandoned by her mother when she was 11, and her only recollection of her father is riding on his shoulders. The only adult influence in her life is her mentor Hannah, who lives in an unfinished house by the river and who has suddenly vanished into thin air.To top all of Taylor’s problems off, there is a territory war about to start between the boarders, the Townies (kids from the Jellicoe Town) and the Cadets (a group of boys who come for a 6 week training exercise every year to Jellicoe). The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother. The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again.Running parallel to Taylor's story is the story that Hannah has been writing, about five kids who grew up in the town 20 years ago. This story is shown in pieces throughout the novel. I loved the way the two stories (past and present) were interwoven. Even though you start to figure out how it all fits together as you read, it doesn't ruin the storyline at all, in fact I found that it enhanced the story as it all meshed together and I started to understand how everything related. I also loved the story of the territory war. Not only because it made for some good laughs but also how it starts as one thing and changes into something else as the story progresses and the characters come together. I don't know where to start with the characters, they were all so real, and each a product of what they had endured in the past. Of course the back stories are slowly revealed throughout the book so you don’t know why they are the way that they are, sometimes until the very end. It was amazing to watch the characters change as their relationships developed and they came to terms with their past. I particularly loved the characters of Taylor, Griggs and the Brigadier - from the beginning you just know that each of them are much more than what they seem. The 5 kids from Hannha’s story and the secondary characters Chaz, Raffy, and the rest of the kids from the boarding school, are well fleshed out and add to the story. I’d recommend this book to everybody. Lots of laughs, and a few tears as well. A fantastic book by a great Australian author.

I've had years to marinate over the (nearly) unanimous love for this book. It has a tendency to raise expectations, you know. So maybe if I'd read it years back, I wouldn't have found it good, emotionally effective, but a bit disappointing.The first 100 or so pages were kind of a slog. I very nearly checked out more than once. I simply wasn't interested in the turf wars between Boarders, Townies, and Cadets. It all seemed so silly, so entirely overblown, that something that lasts only a few weeks would have such an incredibly high importance for everyone involved. It's not like these are rival schools, just across town, not entirely. The Cadets are only in town for about two months a year and surely have other things to do with their time. Rivalry made sense, but elaborate decade and a half wars with treaties and maps? Just kind of silly, and not terribly interesting. I only kept reading because I found myself becoming invested in Taylor despite myself. I got entirely caught up in her voice, in her emotions, and in wanting to see things turn out better for her. That, I think, is where this book really shines. And not just when it comes to Taylor herself. The teenage characters in this book all feel so real, and Marchetta put in serious effort in developing them to be so. And so I kept reading, to the point where the plot became bearable, just because I kind of loved these characters in a story that I didn't care about at all.I sometimes complain about a lack of actually present adult role models, and that's rarely more true than it is here. But I generally forgive the book for that, because that very absence is sort of a plot point, instead of a convenient device. Taylor's personality has been molded by her mother abandoning her at a young age, and by not having a true substitute parental figure in her life at all. Hannah is the closest thing she has to an adult who cares for her on a personal level, and she's always kept her at arm's length and vanishes at the beginning of the book. (view spoiler)[Seriously, Hannah, what the hell? I get that Taylor's mother specifically asked her not to be a mother to her, but there's no reason she couldn't have been an aunt. And there's also no reason for her to put the vague wishes of Taylor's absent, drug addicted mother over the very real needs of her young niece. I'm so sad for Taylor that the one person entrusted to care for her still wasn't able to put her first. (hide spoiler)] So yes, while it's a trope that I'm a little sick of, it was used very well here.I do wonder if reading this sooner might have made me feel a little more forgiving towards those first 100 pages. Then again, without the vast reputation this book has, I doubt I would have continued past the first 100 pages. It was worth it, in the end.",7,default,"['contemporary', 'young-adult']"

I was so overwhelmed for hours thinking about what I've just read. Reading the first 200 pages of this book was a slow and almost agonizing process for me. I kept looking at other friends review to reassure myself that this book was worth it in the end. And boy am I glad to have kept reading, oh yes,I am !!There are still one or two things I don't understand about the story. (view spoiler)[How intense was the territorial war? Were the kids ever serious? What exactly are Cadets sand Townies? Are they like kids that are sent to a summer camp or something?  (hide spoiler)] I had a very hard time placing the scene in a certain time line. It seemed ""dystopian"" at first but it mentions Michael Jackson and Harry Potter which made me even more confused. But apparently the Townies, Cadets and the Houses were at ""war"". It just didn't seem like a child's game of tick tack toe. Aside from this major conflict there are questions to be asked about Taylor (the main character) and her past. And the story about Webb, Narine, Fitz, Tate (who I only realized later was used as a woman's name =P) and Jude. (who turned out to be used as a male's name) The story of these five people that didn't fit at all in between chapters. You realize how hard it was, and I'm quite amazed and proud of myself for not quit reading then and there. It was exactly at page 218 when I started to put jigsaw puzzles together. And once that name ""Xavier Webster Schroeder"" was said, I had goosebumps all lover my arms and realized that those 200 pages were well worth it. But there were so many other mysteries to be solved and I wasn't going to stop until I found out every single one of them. And the author's way of slowly revealing them was genius. This book is about I'll-die-if-you-die kind of love, my-whole-life-has-changed-because-of-you kind of love, I'll-go-insane-if-you-leave-me kind of love. But it's also about friendship built on love and trust. Redemption and forgiveness. I'll recommend this book for those who wants to feel.

I dare you to prove me wrong.I'm not kidding though somehow she's done what I started to assume she would do and not only amaze me again but put me in my place as I read through this book.

She's done it again"" and I wonder will she ever cease to amaze me.Special Note: I will go on record stating that the audiobook isn't perfect. I won't say I would avoid it.

I am still stunned. Just as ""Saving Francesca"" and ""Looking for Alibrandi"" by Marchetta, this book has made me cry. But additionally it has made me sit in silent stupor on the sofa afterwards, because even the hopeful and positive ending could not erase the enormous sadness the story instilled in me. It is difficult to explain without giving to much away concerning the mystery of Taylor Markham's past which unravels piece by piece. Taylor is a state ward in an Australian boarding school. She was abandoned by her drug-addicted mother at a Seven-Eleven and almost immediately found by a woman named Hannah when she was eleven years old. Before Jellicoe Boarding School Taylor lived with Hannah for a year, who is a counselor at Taylor's dormitory now. As newly elected head of her house Taylor is responsible for the well-being of her house-mates, but also for the traditional territorial wars with the so-called Townies and the Cadets, a bunch of boys from a military school camping in the woods. Taylor's past catches up with her, when she has to negotiate with moody cadet Jonah Griggs. Four years ago she got rather close to him him when she tried to run away to find her mother and he was trying to go back to his family. Taylor still blames him for getting caught, for betraying her. The situation gets even messier, when Hannah suddenly disappears without telling Taylor. Taylor begins to realise how much Hannah means to her and that there might be a connection between the story Hannah has been writing about five kids living on Jellicoe Road twenty years before, Hannah's distance and her own life. The narration alternates between the present told from Taylor's point of view and snippets from Hannah's manuscript. I read and read and felt so sorry for Taylor, for Hannah, for Jonah, for the five friends, for Jessa, the Hermit and other people. Not likely to forget them.

And I don't know :) (haha waaa sorry I'm emotional ^^)This book is about broken people, lost people, people who life has -I'm not going to say mistreated them- but whoa that's a lot of baggage to carry, just saying.But the story is so beautiful that you get yourself into it. And it starts so silly (that territory war really? I was just seriously how could they have drag that thing for 17 years!?) but then it begins to get so serious and intense!This book is about friendship... and you know this saying ""Friends are the family you choose"" or something like that. This people didn't choose each other they found each other, and saved each other. It was just so heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time.I wanted to give it 5 stars but they are just some small things that.. Well, the book starts pretty confusing! They are two stories and so many characters and names and stuff going on that you don't get anything, and when you finally start to get it then it gets predictable. This is not entirely bad, it just annoyed me. But everything else was so good that you really don't care for this.One thing I like to say is that I usually don't like books with two or more stories in them because you usually get attached to one of them and the others are just in the middle of the whole thing and you just want to skipped it or read it fast so you get to where you want.

Everything about this book, from the characters to how they relate to each other to the emotions, is intense. I finished reading this a couple of days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. Book hangover alert! This is such a beautiful book about love, friendship and family.

One of her boarding school's house mothers, Hannah, picked her up and watched out for her ever since. When Hannah suddenly disappears without an explanation, Taylor realizes that her past is somewhat tied to Hannah's and she has to uncover mysteries to learn more about herself.I admit that I was lost and confused by the first few chapters of the book. Taylor narrates but interspersed in her story are pages from Hannah's manuscript about the incredible friendship of five kids who used to live in that area. Hannah's story occured more than twenty years ago so basically you're following two story arcs as you read. I think this is also the first time that I've read a novel set in Australia so some of the terms used and the school structure were a bit confusing for me. Just keep reading and by the time you get to the middle, I'm sure you won't be able to stop. Each revelation will make you want to know more. I love the characters in this book - Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz and also the kids in the manuscript: Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude and Fitz. They're all a part of this amazing story. And the sizzling connection between Taylor and Jonah has fed my YA romance hunger. I highly recommend this to fellow YA fans or even those who aren't into YA.

Melina Marchetta is one of those authors. I love how she manipulates words. Sometimes, I still feel like crying myself to sleep over The Piper’s Son and Froi of Exiles only improved on the second reading. On the Jellicoe Road is a different animal. The stories of Taylor Markham, Jonah Griggs, Ben Cassidy, Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude never really came together for me.

Of a character driven story. See what I did there.When I’m reading a character driven novel I need to be able to connect with the secondary characters if not with the—unreliable—narrator. Every fragmented scene was merely an anecdote that had happened to someone else, to people I don’t know or wish to meet. It was all so far, far away from me. I’m not talking about the fact that I live in Northern Europe and the author with her characters lives in Australia, I’m talking about the emotional connection that never was. I did not care. On a technical level I can admire what Marchetta was trying to achieve by indulging in non-linear storytelling and I wish there were more books like this—only better—to challenge readers of all ages. The problem is she’s not good enough author to pull it off. Neither was Hal Duncan, come to think of it, no matter what the award committees might think.

I don't like being sad. A lot of authors feel manipulative when they make me cry - doing bold awful things to their characters. It feels like they're squeezing the tears out. But here I was happy to cry. If I tell you what the books about it sounds silly. Taylor is at boarding school - playing a war game with the kids from town and the cadets from a military school each fall. She's also trying to figure out who she is - literally - not a euphemism. Taylor doesn't know her parents. And it seems like she doesn't even know where to start to get the answers - but it turns out they're right in front of her. So the book is a mystery. And a romance. And a growing-up-and-getting-better story. All of it lightly done - the story has a gauzy nearly ephemeral quality. I read the first ten pages of the book four times. I thought I was missing something. It literally made no damn sense. But I was reading a puzzle - and when you're just looking at the top right corner piece you're not seeing the waterfall. I think this may be the best book I've read this year. It may have usurped those 42 dead Japanese kids. But I'm going to readdress that question in a few days - when this buzz has worn off. Bc - no lie? - I have a book high like you would not believe. I just read a story with so much sadness and so much love that it was magical. Ps - the romance aspect? It was a 6 out of 5 stars.

I live on the Jellicoe Road. There are the Townies who think they own the place, and the Cadets who come once a year. Then there’s the Jellicoe School – a collection of abandoned and troubled teenagers who have all congregated at this bushland boarding academy.And every year, there’s the territory war.For as long as anyone can remember the boarders, cadets and townies battle it out for territory around Jellicoe – from the prayer tree to the club house, bike tracks and river walks. Jellicoe is a puzzle, and whoever gathers the most pieces, wins. This year Taylor Markham has been voted leader of the school. Santangelo is the Townie boss, and Jonah Griggs the Cadet commander. Between the three of them they’ll wage war … but when the battle gets underway, the fight takes a turn none of them saw coming.Taylor and Jonah have a history. They ran away together when they were fourteen years old. Taylor was running to her mother, the one who abandoned her on the Jellicoe road when she was eleven-years-old. And Jonah was just running.When the war gets underway Taylor’s house mentor, her beloved Hannah, leaves unexpectedly with no word of when she’ll return. Taylor travels down to Hannah’s half-finished house everyday, searching for clues… like Hannah’s manuscript. The novel-in-progress tells tale of five Jellicoe children; Narnie, Jude, Tate, Webb and Fitz. The plot is out of order and mired in tragedy, but the more Taylor reads the more she’s convinced that there’s truth to the story. And maybe, just maybe, Hannah’s story will fill the gaps in Taylor’s own memory.First published in 2006, ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is Melina Marchetta’s standing ovation. Winner of the 2009 Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature, ‘Jellicoe’ put Marchetta on the world stage and for many young readers it is the Marchetta book of their generation.‘On the Jellicoe Road’ was a real departure for Ms Marchetta, and as a result the book seems to have a polarizing love/hate effect on audiences. Both ‘Looking for Alibrandi’ and ‘Saving Francesca’, Marchetta’s first two novels, were told in linear. But ‘Jellicoe’ is not that easy. Narrated by Taylor Markham, readers are subjected to her fragmented mind – we are privy to the holes in her memory where something from her childhood is simply too awful to recount, but little pieces come floating out of the ether. Taylor’s memory is jogged by the sudden disappearance of her beloved Hannah, the woman who found her abandoned on the Jellicoe road all those years ago … with Hannah’s disappearance Taylor is forced to link the tragedies of the past with the events in her life today.Aided by Hannah’s unfinished manuscript, Taylor delves into the tales of five Jellicoe teenagers; reading about their antics and friendship, the sadness that bought them all together and the tragedy that tore them apart. The tale of the Jellicoe five becomes the parallel story to Taylor’s, told in fragments as Taylor reads various pages of the manuscript and pieces the plotline together…This, I think, is the biggest hurdle for readers to overcome. The backwards and forwards momentum of the novel and the duel stories, coupled with Taylor’s determined forgetfulness around the events of her childhood … it means that the novel comes to us in drips and drabs, the story leaking out like a dripping tap. But, therein lies the beauty of ‘Jellicoe’. This is a tough novel, to be sure, but it’s also one of Marchetta’s most rewarding and heart wrenching. ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is a novel that stays with you long after you’ve read the last line. Taylor Markham leaves an impression, and if you persevere with the novel (despite lingering doubts) you’ll never regret having met her.‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is especially beloved for having such a wonderful array of characters. From the Townies to Cadets, but especially the Jellicoe School, this is one novel that offers up a smorgasbord of secondary characters. There’s Townie leader, Santangelo, flanked by his Mullet Brothers (also affectionately called Heckle and Jeckle). His father is the resident Jellicoe cop, and Santangelo has a dubious and complicated past with Raffaela (a townie girl who attends the Jellicoe School). Ben and Raffaela are Taylor’s reluctant confidantes, the only two Jellicoe students who don’t immediately doubt Taylor’s capabilities as the new leader in their territory war. Then there’s Jonah Griggs. Josie had bad-boy Jacob Coote, while Francesca pined for strong silent type, Will Trombal … but Jonah Griggs is in a league all his own amongst Marchetta’s men. Taylor first met him at a train platform when they were both fourteen years old and running away, now they are each leading their own factions and fraternizing with the enemy is strictly forbidden. There are rumours about Jonah. Rumours about what he did to his father when he couldn’t take one more beating. Rumours about what he does to those who trespass on Cadet territory. But the most persistent rumours concern him and Taylor … Jonah Griggs will break your heart, only to melt it again. I think he remains Marchetta’s most complex male lead (though Finnikin and Tom Mackee are giving him a run for his money). Jonah is beautiful for his complexities and many shades of grey. He has a violent past that continues to impact him today, but with Taylor he seems to find an inner peace that is born of their intense love. Taylor and Jonah are definitely a stand-out couple, especially for their proof that you can heal after tragedy, but not by yourself. How does Jonah Griggs get to be a ten? He sits on a train with me when we’re fourteen and he weeps, tearing at his hair, bashing his head with the palm of his hand, self-hatred pouring out of him like blood from a gut wound in a war movie, and for the first time in my whole life I have a purpose. I am the holder of the grief and pain and guilt and passion of Jonah Griggs and as we sit huddled on the floor of the carriage, he allows me to hold him, to say, ‘Shhh, Jonah, it wasn’t your fault.’ While his body still shakes from the convulsions, he takes hold of my hand and links my fingers with his and I feel someone else’s pain for the first time that I can remember.As I said, ‘On the Jellicoe Road’ is not an easy tale. It’s tough and bitter – Taylor’s past will haunt and anger you, Jonah’s confession will have you choking back tears and the unravelling tale of the Jellicoe Five will leave you a little bit heart-sick. But God, this book is beautiful. Marchetta took a chance and wrote a complex backwards-and-forwards novel, based largely around the memory gaps of one girl’s delicate psyche. She writes about an ages-old territory war, which is intrinsically linked to a town’s history that has seen an abundance of sorrow. This novel is filled with characters you’ll never forget, and two stories that will imprint on your heart and have you re-reading again and again and again. Not an easy read, but then again the best one’s never are. How to describe my adoration for this particular novel, when I love all of Melina Marchetta’s work so very much? Well, it’s probably best summarized by Taylor Markham herself;  I fall in love with these kids over and over again and my heart aches for their tragedies and marvels at their friendship.

I’ve been hearing about this book FOREVER, it seems. Since I’ve read Finnikin of the Rock and loved it, I knew Melina Marchetta’s writing was for me. So I figured this was book would be an excellent choice to start off 2016 right. But omg, I’m caught between holy shit this book nothing is ever going to outshine it this year what a perfect choice and why the fuck did I wait so long to read this Holly you’re such an idiot for putting it off after you got a copy? It did take me a long time to ease into the story. Things were so, so confusing in the beginning, and I had no idea what was happening. And it took a little bit of patience on my end, and more of an effort to keep myself into the story. But once everything started making more sense, and the story was easier to follow along with, I was so hooked on the main character’s voice, and I couldn’t stop reading.Taylor Markham is chosen as the Lachlan’s house leader, reluctantly. She doesn’t seem to care about the wars, or about anything, really. She’s pretty much an orphan, bitter about the world and about her life. Feeling trapped by her past and all of the kids in her House leaning on her for comfort and safety. And when her friend, Hannah, disappears, those feelings of helplessness just increase tenfold. I’ll be honest, Taylor isn’t an easy character to like (and, well, neither is Jonah). She’s cold, pushes people away who just want to make her feel loved and cared for, and she makes decisions without thinking of the consequences or of who’s going to get hurt by it. But underneath that hardened, tough exterior is just a girl who doesn’t know how to let the shadows of her past stop her from moving on. She doesn’t know who she is, and throughout the book, she’s learning right along with you. I loved her story; I loved her character.I loved her strength and her fierceness. I loved that she wanted to be a better person, and that she started trying. I loved that she didn’t let anything stop her from going after the answers she so desperately wanted. And what she finds is, not only her past, but a future worth living for.And in that future lies people she never expected to be in it, least of all Jonah fucking Griggs. This guy. Whoa, boy. He’s not a nice guy. In fact, he’s kind of an asshole who does assholish things and who never apologizes for them. But his actions speak louder than his words, and so, even when he’s being a dick, you can tell there’s a heart underneath that roughness. He just doesn’t really show it, not even to Taylor. But as you learn more about him, you find that perhaps he’s just a kid who’s just sad, who’s hurt and embittered about the world. Perhaps he’s just using that meanness to keep people away, because he doesn’t want to get hurt further than he has been. Perhaps, he even deserves a bit of forgiveness for the way he speaks to others, and to Taylor. Though I feel like we could have gotten to know him better, that he could have been a bit more well-rounded as a character, I think I see the reason why he’s not. Because this wasn’t about him, it was never about him or what he could be to Taylor. The story was Taylor’s story, but one that he wanted to be a part of. She didn’t NEED him to be a better or stronger person, but she had his support and his fumbling attempts to give her the romance she deserves.Melina Marchetta has this subtle way of writing, where she doesn’t outright tell you something, but uses her words in such a way that it has more impact. I don’t even know if that made sense, but omg, just like. She’s a phenomenal storyteller, and the way she unraveled the two colliding stories was utterly brilliant. I’m not sure if I was supposed to be paying close attention to the connections, but I did. And because I did, nothing was a surprise to me. I was able to figure out (almost) everything that had happened in the past, and about how Taylor was connected to the accident that happened 22 years before. But you know what? Knowing didn’t matter. I was still hit with the impact of everything. I was still caught up in the mystery that Taylor is trying to figure out. The question of “where is Hannah” led her on a quest that helped her move on from her past. And man, the manuscript, the story of the five kids whose lives were irrevocably changed on the Jellicoe Road that fateful day, dug deep into my heart. I was just as invested in the past as I was in Taylor’s present. I was not expecting that, nor was I expecting the amount of tears I shed over a book that I never thought would be… inspiring.And I think that had to do with the friendships in this book, the connections between people who you would never expect to become family to one another. Through a tragedy, five lives are forever changed. And over the course of the story, you see how much strength and happiness and peace is gained through the connections the characters have with each other. And that happens with Taylor, also. Not only does she find a relationship with Jonah, one that gives her courage and support, but she finally starts to let other people in. Raffaela, Santangelo, Ben, Hannah. The former two, they become hands to hold as Taylor’s life unravels and she loses sight of who she is. But don’t think that means they’re one-dimensional or anything. Maybe except for Ben, everyone else has their own stories and personalities too, and it makes the book even richer. I especially loved the scenes with Raffy, Santangelo, Jonah, and Taylor. They became their own gang, outside of the wars, and one that gave Taylor a new appreciation for life. Because they stuck by her through everything, even when she tried to push them away. And that kind of friendship, the unshakable kind, is beautiful to behold!This book was expectedly and unexpectedly brilliant. I don’t know how to really express the ways in which this story meant the world to me, but I tried. I hope I did it justice. Jellicoe Road was so much more than what I had thought I would get out of this story when I started it. And I know, I know this book isn’t going to be one that I’ll forget anytime soon. Nor will its characters, who managed to break and heal me in the same moment. It was a stunning, honest, and deeply felt story that captured my heart completely.brb moving to Jellicoe Road.Rating: 5 Paw Prints!",6,default,"['made-me-cry', 'amazingly-wonderful', 'inspirational', 'left-me-speechless', 'i-ship-this-couple', 'feels-feels-everywhere', 'tortured-heroes', 'bff-goodness', 'get-rec-d', 'all-time-favorites']"

My first Melina Marchetta contemporary
Okay first is a lie. Technically ON THE JELLICOE ROAD is my second Marchetta contemporary because I had to read LOOKING FOR ALIBRANDI in high school. Either way, I loved this as much as I loved FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK! I cannot wait to delve into more of Marchetta’s contemporary fiction, or all the other books she’s written really.
Dual storylines
I loved the way this story was told. There are two dual storylines, one from the manuscript and Taylor’s, which overlap a tonne more than I was expecting. So much is inter-related and every single aspect is interesting. I loved the territory wars (it made it so much more entertaining than your usual romance/ family based contemporary) and the depth of the relationships between all the characters.
Super Australian
I’ve never been to boarding school but I’ve been to school my entire life here in Aus, and I can tell you the atmosphere of the Jellicoe school is 100% accurate. Yes, we do have school houses but they’re not as cool as the Hogwarts houses. The lingo in this is also spot on and I really appreciated the use of an Australian narrator for the audiobook!
Taylor’s growth
I’m so proud of Taylor. From a girl who really didn’t want any responsibility in the beginning, she grew so much and became a fantastic leader. I can’t believe how much stuff she’s been through in her past, how much many of the characters have been through in their past honestly. They’re all so precious.
So many emotions
I did not expect to be so ruined by this book but it really does destroy all your emotions multiple times. Even the most minor characters pull at your heart strings. It’s so easy to become incredibly connected to every single character, you really feel for them when bad things happen, and when you learn about their past you just want to tuck them under a blanket and give them a massive hug. They’re all so precious.
In Summary
I’m so glad I’ve finally had the opportunity to read some Marchetta contemporaries. ON THE JELLICOE ROAD was fantastic, so full of feels and emotions, I loved everything about it. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of Marchetta’s stuff. Highly recommended for fans of contemporary novels.",6,default,"['audiobook', 'read-2017', 'own', 'favorites', 'library']"
1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1204945492,1204945492,2015-02-18,5,Eri,/user/show/5509001-eri,"3/20/2015I was rereading this yesterday so I think it's finally time to write a review for it.I thought I had experienced the brilliance of Melina Marchetta's writing when I read Saving Francesca, a stellar novel that reduced me to an aching mess. That was nothing compared to the emotional wreckage that came with reading Jellicoe Road. It is a beautiful novel, well deserving of its high praise, and it is at once a heartbreaking tale but also one that will warm your heart, down to thedark depths of it. It's not the easiest book to get into, especially because the beginning is hard to understand, at least it was for me until the third attempt to start it. But it is well worth that initial struggle. This is the story of Taylor Lily Markham, a girl with no parents. A girl with a past that she doesn't even understand. The story of love, loss, family, and the beautiful power of relationships, all kinds. 
See, I remember love.
 She is a part of a long tradition in her town, the border skirmishes that involve the three parties of the Townies, the Jellicoe School kids, who include herself, and the Cadets. The Cadets who include Jonah Griggs. It isn't a laughing matter, but a serious one that encompasses an old set of rulesand bloodshed. This year, now that Taylor is the leader, things are going to be different. But facing Jonah, who is the leader of the Cadets, is another story altogether. With a shared past, Jonah Briggs is the last person Taylor trusted, before things went horribly wrong. I don't want to give much away but there is a story behind every past, and theirs is the kind that elicits the urge to hug the characters. Or at least, in my case.Jonah Griggs, let's say he and I didn't get off on the right foot. I was unsure ofwhether I was going to love him or not, but I should have had faith. By the halfway point in the book I was utterly in love with this boy. This book isn't quite a romance but the part of the book that was, I wholeheartedly loved, especially the way it unfolded. Beside Taylor are lovable side characters, the other Jellicoe School kids, each with an endearing face that will make you long to be with them. It's impossible not to fall in love with them and the cherish the bond that holds the characters together. In particular, Raffy and Ben are the ones that feature the most and in whatever universe they truly exist, I wish them the best (view spoiler)[*cough* Raffy with Chaz and Ben with Justine is preferable (hide spoiler)].
""I believe in you, Taylor Markham.""
And there is the question of Taylor's past, how Hannah, the one adult that Taylor can trust, features in it and so much more. It is truly a journey to travel with her, through the heartbreaking joy and tragedy that follows her.A vital part of this story is about five characters whose intertwining lives are the heart of this story. To divulge anymore would be a crime, but all I can assure you of is that by the time all is revealed I was earnestly sobbing over them. Without them and the fateful incident on Jellicoe Road, this book would have been lost and I am eternally grateful that Melina Marchetta has the mind to write such a beautiful book. 
...who set out on their separate journeys that day not realizing the tragic ironies and joys of that collision of worlds on the Jellicoe Road.
I don't often think this, but if any young adult book should be featured in english classes in high school, it would be this book. It is truly an honor to read this.Read this review hereFirst Read: 2/18/2015I'm currently silently crying because of this book. Some books leave a mark on your heart that will never fade, and I can say with surety that Jellicoe Road is such a book.

Can't re-call if this is my 4th or 5th time reading On the Jellicoe Road, but it is still just as beautiful and moving and leaves me tearing up on the couch, feeling so emotional!I'm pretty sure I will never stop loving this book. It is just the most gorgeous writing and story! Melina Marchetta knows how to crack your heart open and writes the most moving characters!On the Jellicoe Road is a bit of an older YA book now, published in 2006, and is set in rural Australia. It definitely has one of the more bizarre-sounding plots, and I will admit to being a little bit confused the first time I read it because there's a lot of characters and I didn't realize at first that the story was switching between two different points of view, so I'll warn readers about that up front. The main story is told by Taylor Markham, but everything that's italicized is a different point of view.The novel is set at a boarding school called Jellicoe, which is located about 7 hours drive from Sydney, right next to Jellicoe Town. Every year from September to November, a group of cadets come to Jellicoe to practice their outdoor skills and set up camp in the woods for 6 weeks. There are three main factions: the kids boarding at the Jellicoe school, the Cadets, and the Townies, who live and go to school in Jellicoe Town. During the 6 weeks that the Cadets visit every year, the Townies, Cadets, and Jellicoe School have a secret war going on behind the teacher's backs and duke it out to win territory from each other. This year Taylor has been selected as the leader of the Jellicoe School. Taylor has an unfortunate history and was abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road when she was just 11 years old. She was picked up by Hannah, who lives in a small house next to the school and spends the next 5 years attending the school. Taylor knows very little about her past and struggles with the pain she feels about being abandoned by her mother and hesitates to let anyone into her life. She is tested when at the beginning of term, Hannah, the only person who's ever been there for her, disappears. Taylor wants more from the people in her life, but she's afraid to love or let anyone in lest they abandon her too.The only thing Hannah leaves behind for Taylor is an unfinished manuscript about 5 kids and a tragic accident that happened on the Jellicoe Road 22 years earlier. Taylor is confused by the story, but starts developing an attachment to Hannah's characters, wondering if they might have more to do with her past than she realizes. Every single thing about this story is beautiful. The best thing I've always loved about Marchetta's writing is the bonds and relationships she creates between her characters. Marchetta really understands friendships and our need as humans to belong to something. Taylor is slowly falling apart in this novel and I love watching the relationships she builds with the other kids in the story and how they become friends and support each other. I love how each character has this incredible backstory that brings so much depth to the novel. I love that even Marchetta's minor characters are fully realized individuals and that every character matters. There are never throw away characters in Melina's novels.This is ultimately a story about growing up and self discovery. As someone who has been shuffled around, Taylor craves history and I love the history Marchetta creates between each of the characters. Many of them are very broken people and I love watching them grow throughout the novel. Plus, the writing is so dreamy. I think the manuscript is really well written, but I also love Taylor's inner monologue. There are so many great quotes in this book and it hits me right in the feels every time I read it. You do not have to be a teenager to enjoy this book. It actually has some pretty dark and mature themes and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! Please read, it is by far one of my most favourite books of all time!",6,default,"['favorites', 'young-adult']"

It’s impossible to write a review for this book without wanting to cry. No, I didn’t in fact cry after reading this book because it didn’t have a sad ending; however it was a sad book. When I say sad book I am talking about the fact that there is so much going on in this book, so many characters who lose hope and need to find it again, so many reasons to not go on in the lives of the characters. If that doesn’t make you feel depressed I don’t know what will. Do you ever have those days where you just want to drop down and not care about anything? Where you don’t know what the purpose of your life is and you feel so miserable you have no idea what to do? Imagine having to read about characters going through that, if you can relate to it, it’s somehow worse because when we read a book we want AWAY from reality, we don’t want to have to face the reality of our own situation.In the end though, I believe this book is about never giving up that little bit of hope you will always have stored inside you because once you lose it, you are done for.The stories of each individual character is so amazing, there are no flat characters here. It’s so hard to find a book where each and every character has some sort of meaning to them or are connected to the overall plot somehow instead of tid bids here and there. Marchetta though, fits everything together perfectly, like a puzzle; you wouldn’t even know you were reading something that could be of some importance until you read it. Then you would just be surprised because you’d see what a genius Melina Marchetta was.I was a bit vary going into this book, I mean I’d read Finnikin of the Rock and it didn’t necessarily live up to the hype. Plus this book was a sad one. I don’t usually do sad books because hold this kind of power over me that multiplies all the emotions in the book, so if the book is sad, I am going to be depressed, but after reading this, I gave that rule up. I mean I haven’t gone on a “read depressing books” spree but I don’t avoid them anymore.Although the thing about this book is, I would read it again a hundred times despite how sad it made me because it was also one of the best things that ever happened to me. You see seeing I am not the biggest fan of contemporary/realistic to love a book of that genre this much is pretty amazing, but the thing about this one is that it also has that magical aura to it. Like a dream. It’s so beautiful yet heartbreaking. I think I should probably kill myself for not reading it earlier. It’s not a book for everyone, but the ones lucky enough to love it, they will walk away with one of the most beautiful experiences.Right After Reading the BookHoly. Freaking. Crap.My feels. OH MY FEELS!People are always going on about how great Melina Marchetta is. I read Finnikin of the Rock and I liked it.But this book takes her writing to a whole new level.There is so much pain and love in this book. It makes you want to crawl into a corner and cry your heart out.It hurt so much when you realized that (view spoiler)[ Webb is dead, I always liked him from how Taylor described him and how he was in his own story. But I always suspected it would be him.  (hide spoiler)].There aren't enough words in the world to describe how I feel about this book, but one thing is for sure, it redefines how I will rate my books in the future.This book shouldn't get a 5.

What a gorgeously written, emotionally exhausting, brilliantly constructed and effortlessly executed piece of art this book is! I can't tell you much about this book without spoiling, but it's honestly something that everyone needs to experience themselves. Yes, the rumors are true: it takes quite a while to understand things but when you understand you're in it for the long haul! I knew that this ""not understanding"" part could be an issue, but I just tried to go with the flow and enjoy it as much as possible until the turning point. This book does NOT disappoint, let me tell you!
“A home to come back to every day of their lives.Where they would all belong or long to be.A place on the Jellicoe Road.”
This is foremost a book about characters AND THEY ARE ALL SO AMAZING! Quite frankly idk who I love more, because they're all so squishy and lovable and broken but you can't help but root for them and then you want them to all have the world and oh god I'm getting extra, aren't I? Alright. Um. Um. Ummmmmmm even though the book is mostly character-driven, plot doesn't lack one bit. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and there are so many twists and turns and there are OMFG kind of happenings and everything. There is quite a bit of fooling around (in every possible sense of this term) and I loved following all of these dorks during the Territory wars. The book itself has two narratives. One where our MC Taylor leads us through the ""now part"" and one another set of characters. But really! I can't tell you anything more, because oopsy daisy! I wouldn't want to spoil youuuu. So is it finally proper time to speak about my feels since I can't talk about anything else?OK SO THE SHIPS??? I AM BROKEN IN PIECES BUT PUT TOGETHER ALL THE SAME. THIS BOOK IS SO AMAZING ON THE ROMANCE FRONT BUT DON'T LET MY SCREAMING FOOL YOU; JELLICOE IS PAIN! I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I CRIED SO MUCH WHEN IT WASN'T A KRISTA AND BECCA BOOK? MAYBE DURING FIXING DELILAH?? ANYHOW, THIS BOOK BROKE ME IN A THOUSAND TINY PIECES AND AFTER THE BOOK WAS DONE I WAS A SOBBING MESS. I TEXTED KATIE AND ERI THAT I COULDN'T STOP CRYING AND I JUST CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED. THIS WHOLE BOOK IS SO EMOTIONAL [and quite honestly a tad bit fucked up] AND I'M GETTING SO EMO JUST THINKING ABOUT IT ;___________; THIS BOOK IS MAGIC AND YOU SHOULD ALL READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. YOU. ARE. MISSING. OUT. KKKK.This is the place where I apologize and bow down to Tanja and Rashika who have been pestering me for years to read this book. I was stubborn and resisted, because most of Aussie writers' books I've read haven't suited me that much. The books I've read all have this distinct style of writing where words and scenes are cropped and rushed. While Marchetta does have that in her prose, it's very minimal and I never really turn much attention to it, because her books do what very few books are able to: these books suck you in and consume my mind, heart and soul.

Happy 104th read for the year! I loved this just as much the second time around - if not just a little bit more because I didn't have the initial confusion that I had last time and this time around I loved Jude and Jonah from page #1. Magical.Original ReviewOk. Ms Marchetta has totally broken me with this book. There is a reason why this woman is my fave author of all time. Every book she writes just pierces my heart and takes me weeks to recover from emotionally and this book is no different. I went to hear her speak recently and I brought in my entire stash of books to get signed and I am so delighted that I got her to sign this book for me.... With all honesty though, for the first 150 pages of this I was convinced this was a 2 star read and I felt gutted that I had finally read a book by her that I didn't love. I had NO idea what was going on and it is the biggest criticism of this book when you read the reviews (with lots of DNFs attached to it). The story switches between two time periods and for the first third of the book you have no idea who is who and what the three groups (cadets/townies/Jellicoe School kids) are. Actually at the end of the book I am still confused about the five houses - was it a boarding school or an orphanage or something else? I do wish that the three groups were a bit more clearly explained and although part of me realistically wanted to give a lower rating for making me work so hard to get into this story - I just can't as I love this book. I hit page 178 where Jonah makes a reveal (view spoiler)[ ""I wasn't there that day to get on the three forty-seven to Yass,"" he says. ""I was there to throw myself in front of it""  (hide spoiler)] and I just lost it. I totally adore Jonah (what a beautifully broken soul). I love Hannah. I love Jude (and boy does Jude and Hannah remind me of Captain and Beatrice from Finnikin). I love how about half way through the book the two time periods come together and the ""war"" takes on a whole new meaning.I also love when a book with a mystery makes me fall for the red herrings (clever!). I was so convinced that (view spoiler)[ Taylor was the daughter of Hannah and Jude and that she had been kidnapped by Tate. Nope...  (hide spoiler)]. Although I did guess the other mystery surrounding Webb :-(. Oh that again broke my heart into a million pieces. The dialogue is perfect. This is one of the most beautiful books I have read - such friendship and such tragedy, such broken characters - but yet such a story of hope and optimism in the end.

I want to CRY. I just wrote the longest review that got wiped out. Urgh.Alright, I try again, but more concisely.Jia at Dear Author recommended this book: ""I have a bone to pick with you. I’ve got a packed read-and-review schedule for the next month or so, and I need to be able to move from book to book. But you’ve made that impossible. Yes, I blame you. It’s your fault that your book, Jellicoe Road, left me so drained and dazed that I can’t read anything else.""http://dearauthor.com/wordpress/2009/...That statement right there convinced me that I had to read Jellicoe Road. I LOVE that feeling. That feeling I get when I've read something SOOO consuming that I can't move on. I walk around for days in a daze recalling the story and just wanting to be back in that world. So, I knew I had to read Jellicoe Road. I put it on my wish list and then didn't read it until now because many people's reviews have described it as ""slow start"" or ""difficult to understand"" so I began to look at Jellicoe Road as something that would be a chore, but worth it.It wasn't a chore to read at all. I was hooked from the first few pages. The writing is haunting, emotional, and just simply beautiful.Jia also wrote: ""In fact, “enjoyment” seems like too mild a word. After its slow start, the book gathered more and more momentum, until I was completely swept away from thoughts of my own life. I became so invested in Taylor and the other characters in the book that some sections seemed heartbreaking to read, albeit in a cathartic and healing way. I laughed and cried — or, as my husband put it, “blubbered.” When I finished this book, my tear ducts felt completely empty.""This is the story of Taylor Markham. A 17 yo student at the Jellicoe School. A private/state school in rural Australia. When she was 10, Taylor was abandoned at a 7 Eleven by her mother in a nearby town, and has lived at Jellicoe School ever since then. This is also the story of five kids that attended Jellicoe School (or 3 attended Jellicoe school, one was a cadet, and one a Townie) in the generation preceeding Taylor's. Their story is slowly revealed, as their relationship to Taylor is revealed. Jellicoe School students engage in territory warfare with the local kids and a troop of cadets that camp nearby for 8 weeks every year. At the beginning of the story, Taylor is instated as the leader of the Jellicoe kids so she must engage in negotiations and strategy at a time of great confusion for her as she slowly unravels the mysteries of the past. The woman at Jellicoe School whom she has become the closest to has disappeared with no word to her. Taylor is left feeling betrayed, confused and mentally unbalanced.This story is HEARTWRENCHING and absorbing. I loved it. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars (due to my complete love of the characters) is some frustration I have with almost every adult in this book.I don't like their secrets. They are unnecessary and cruel. I also don't like that they all supposedly love Taylor SO MUCH, yet Taylor has NO ONE for the majority of her life. I hate that with a white hot passion. So I docked a star, despite that I strongly suspect the Jellicoe Road will hold a special place in my heart for years to come. ",6,default,[]

It should be recommended to all people who want to nurture their soul. In the past four years I’ve come across a plethora of books that didn’t leave an impression. A positive one.This is why when I stumbled upon this blurb and I read Emily May’s review, I knew I had to have it.I turned the last page twelve hours ago and I haven’t stopped thinking about it ever since. After one year and a half of mediocre novels, discovering this one was like coming up for fresh air. Well-crafted, well-thought, perfectly balanced.    The head nerd of the Cadets is my partner and when it’s over he asks me for my number. I say no. “It’s because they don’t have coverage out here,” Griggs tells him.“No,” I say, looking up at Griggs. “It’s actually because my heart belongs to someone else.” And if I could bottle the look on his face, I’d keep it by my bedside for the rest of my life.  I can’t give away too many details, because when it comes to this book and these characters tiptoeing around the plot (and its sub-plot) is the best I can give you. What did Jellycole Road remind me of? Another YA. We were liars. Where the line between reality and dream was so thin, I couldn’t discern what was happening and what was not.Dream. Such a weak and solitary word if we think about it. But for Taylor, the main character, a dream held so much power over her, she kept chasing it over and over again. A dream was the culprit of her parting ways with Jonah, years prior. A dream was where she had named herself.   “Go to hell,” he said, but there was a desolate fear in his eyes and I couldn’t look away. “Been there. Trust me. It’s so overrated.”  I liked every single character. Every.single.one. Raffy with her sentimental, but firm attitude, Santangelo with his stoic voice, Ben the violinist turned advisor and Jonah. He blew me away like no other YA male character ever had.    ""Jonah Griggs standing, watching me. Like he did on that station platform. Like he did those times we lay side by side on our way to Yass. Staring like he’s never stopped. For a moment the mask slips from his face, but by that time I’m almost out the door.""  This author, made me feel. So much. It’s a novel that makes you think. It’s a book that leaves you guessing. It’s a book that makes you question the outcome and perhaps a little bit of your own sanity.It’s the first five stars rating I’ve given after reading All the ugly and wonderful things one year and a half ago.Go in blind, go in with your heart and your open-mind.

There are no words to describe this. What do you want me to say? That her writing made me weep because it's so beautiful? That it's so vivid, it feels like I'm watching the story from the sidelines? That it's so engrossing I'd yell like a banshee at anyone who tried to talk to me? That her whole idea of the book is sheer brilliance? That I wish I could be part of their world? Be a part of the territory wars? To be super close with Taylor and Raffy and the rest of them? Because this book is all those things, and so much more. There is incredible character development-Taylor's development. At the beginning, she's a devil-may-care, don't-give-a-shit-about-shit angry girl, whom, in different circumstances, I would've detested. On the contrary, I loved her from the get-go. She possesses spunk, brilliance, personality and charm. Later on, as the story progresses, we see the kindness in her, the love and respect she has for everyone and the faith, without losing her other admirable attributes. She is awesome, amazing; absolutely unforgettable. In fact, all the characters of this novel are unforgettable: Raffy, Ben, Jude, Hannah, Webb, Tate, Fitz, Chaz, Jessa, Chloe P., the Mullet brothers, Jonah, dear God, even Richard. They all have their distinctive, wonderful personalities. They all fit in the story without taking space. They are one of the best supporting characters I have ever had the fortune to read of. To meet. To remember. Moreover, the romantic parts of On the Jellicoe Road don't take over the whole story. The story's about Taylor finding herself, her past and present. Although the romantic bits are kept to a minimum, they're far better and far more swoon-worthy than a book that is all about romance. That Jonah Griggs, he makes my heart skip multiple beats, and I'm sure them aliens can hear the butterflies fluttering wildly in my tummy and my heart pounding when it isn't skipping multiple beats. Furthermore, it made me cry, this book. Because of the sadness of it all, the beauty of it all; the desire for it to not end, not just yet. A little bit longer, please, because I don't want to part with this book, this brilliance. The only disappointment I have is that I guessed everything a few chapters into the story. But that's probably due to watching a lot of crime shows. Or maybe I'm a crazy genius. I think it's the latter. This is my first Melina Marchetta book, but it most certainly won't be the last. If all her books leave me speechless like this, then I will gobble them all up like gummy bears till the end of time.

(along with picture quotes that I made).This is a book that's been sitting on my shelf for almost three years. Not kidding. I bought it awhile ago, not having a clue who this author was, or even knowing anything about the story, and thought I'd give it a try. I made it maybe a few chapters and felt completely lost and gave up. Who is this lady? And who told her she could write? I thought it was totally confusing and I should not waste another minute attempting to decipher it. Back on the shelf it went.Fast forward a year and I decide to give this author another try with Saving Francesca and then with The Piper's Son. Woah. Now I was completely aware of who she was, and immensely blown away by her writing. Everyone kept telling me I needed to read Jellicoe Road, that it's amazing. But I was also warned it's a book that takes awhile to push through. You have to give it time to marinate into your bones, simmer awhile inside your soul, but keep pushing through. I kept adding this book to my bookish resolutions, TWICE, to read it that year. But this fear kept creeping inside me, pushing it further back on the shelf.Well, folks. It's finally happened. I feel like I've just conquered a huge reading milestone in my life.I've read Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta.And what a beautiful, majestic, breathtakingly heart ache of a story it is.So what's the story about, you may be asking. I know I questioned this myself before I read the book, and never got a true answer. Something about a group of kids, on the Jellicoe Road, a tree, and a Jonah Griggs. But WHAT IS IT ABOUT?? I honestly don't think I can give the answers to that either. It's a book you have to experience for yourself, and quite possibly go into it blindfolded. Just know that it's a story so rich and pure with a plot that twists and turns, cultivating into the most beautiful ending your literary heart may ever experience.Shut out your fears, jump off that fence, and read this book right now. There is never going to be the ""right time"". NOW is the right time. Trust me when I say this, you're missing out on something extraordinary without knowing the beauty of this story. Melina Marchetta already chiseled out a place inside my heart with the previous two novels I read by her, but now she's solidified a spot in my top honors of writers who can never be topped, no matter what.I am so happy to have finally found my place among these Jellicoe Fans.

I have titled her as the Queen of Feels and Destruction. I know my rating for this book suggests otherwise, I did enjoy this book. It was my least favorite out of all the books I have read by her, though. Let me explain.First of all, I did not understand Taylor Markham. Reading her narrations felt like I needed her to explain more about how she felt towards her problems. There was a lack of a voice in her. With Marchetta's other female characters, I understood their frustration or their anger towards something, but with Taylor I felt like she was a brick wall. I didn't like her at times because she acted like such a stone cold bitch with her friends and Jonah. I just could not relate to her. And a lack of personality in her also did not help. I also did not enjoy the interweaving plots with Taylor's story and Hannah's. Not only was I utterly confused (because I am a very slow human being), I was just aggravated at the times where I needed to read Hannah's manuscript about the five kids on the Jellicoe Road. I skipped those parts, to be honest. I was just not interested, and that may have completely destroyed my understanding of the book, but oh well... I just did not have the patience to jump back and forth from past to the present.Lastly, the pacing was a bit off at times. Sometimes the book went slowly and then it soared. What I did enjoy about the book were the characters. Jonah, Chaz, and Raffy were such sweethearts. They were great friends to Taylor! I loved their backgrounds and I did not feel as though Marchetta left any of them out when it came to character development. I appreciated that. I also enjoyed the beautiful writing, though that is not a surprise when it comes to Marchetta. Her writing is perfection. Overall, I could not handle the feels at many parts of this book. Hell, I cried reading the prologue, and the story didn't even start at that time. I realized. Do you guys ever categorize authors when you pick up their books multiple times?

Maybe I will have to give it another shot sometime. As it was I mostly found myself bored and impatient with it, a bit. I found myself skimming forward quite a bit, just wanting to know what was going on so that I'd be finished. The book moves back and forth between Hannah, our protagonist, and the five other people that the book is about, and honestly, it just... didn't grab me? I don't know. After this and We Were Liars I've come to realize that it takes a very skilled book to grab me and slowly reveal something without me getting so impatient that it completely spoils my enjoyment of it. Added to that is the fact that honestly, Hannah is incredibly unlikable. She's definitely been through some shit, but there's only so far that my patience will extend with dealing with that if I don't empathise with the character. Somehow that was lacking for me, here. I mostly wanted to shake her and tell her to get over herself, honestly. The way that she treats others, the way that she lashes out... I hated it, and mostly found myself sympathizing with other people over her. I was similarly impatient with one of the other characters in the book, Griggs - for him to be as compelling as the author clearly wanted him to be, the arrogance and the attitude would have had to be toned down a bit. So yes, between the plot that didn't grab me and the characters that irritated me, not entirely what I was expecting from this book, and a little disappointing. Maybe a reread someday in the future will make this book gel for me in a different way.",6,default,"['read-in-2016', 'disappointing', 'needs-more', 'blah']"

Yet, there were enjoyable parts, and it never got too serious or depressing for me. I would highly recommend this for those looking for an emotionally hard-hitting older YA book. There were a ton of emotions going on for me while I read, which seemed to arise pretty naturally from the story, without much manipulation from the author (although I thought a few plot points were somewhat emotionally excessive and gratuitous, but I'll forgive the book for that). The characters and character development were very well done. I loved Jonah, and Taylor rang true for me as a portrayal of a teenager who had grown up in very difficult circumstances and then been abandoned as a child. I really felt for most of the characters. What I loved most was how the characters frequently acted like real people, not perfect facsimiles. This made the relationships between the characters rocky at time, but much more touching.I do, however, have some criticisms. First, I just didn't ""get"" the territory wars in which the three groups of teenagers participated. The war didn't sound fun for the most part to me, in fact quite the opposite, so I don't understand why they would keep competing/fighting with each other. Did they really have absolutely nothing better to do with their time? Plus, where was the adult supervision? But ultimately, this issue of mine didn't really end up mattering. Secondly, I did find a number of things somewhat predictable.An excellent book overall and one that I anticipate will stay with me for a long time.",6,default,"['read-ya', 'reviewed', 'read-novels', 'gladiator-games']"

I'm usually not one to get caught up in unraveling a mystery, especially in the form of flashbacks, but the way the timeline played out was so cleverly done that you couldn't help but fall in love with the secondary set of past characters who are introduced throughout the book.

I don't know that I've ever connected with a teen heroine so much in my life as her. You can feel every last bit of her pain and confusion and growth. And don't get me started on Griggs, her love interest. An instant, lifelong OTP was made here today. There's not of that cliche YA nonsense happening here.

It's only appropriate, really, for the beginning to confuse us, since Taylor is sort of lost herself. Since she is telling us the story as she struggles with her role at school, her missing mother, the disappearance of a favorite adult, and needy peers, we see her frustrated state of mind. There are intriguing hints of a story that took place a generation before, and slowly the two stories connect. The ending is an unexpectedly forceful tearjerker, with happy and painful moments crushed together. At its heart, it feels like a story about how character and friendships can be formed at an early age, and how those moments never really leave a person - but it never turns the story into anything cheesy. I do think that this focus will appeal to teens who are in that intense friendship stage. This begs to be reread.Recommended to readers looking for an emotionally gripping story who have the patience for a slow start. There's some violence - car accidents, fights, a suicide, hints of child abuse - that are more emotionally intense than graphic, as are the brief sex scenes. Updated: she's won the Printz!

The word 'enigmatic' is used in the blurb above and I couldn't think of a more perfect way to sum up this novel. Marchetta leaves clues beginning right from the very first page and by the end of the book you'll be slapping your forehead in disbelief you didn't pick up obvious - yet crucial - elements. The story starts off at a slow pace as the reader tries to figure out what the deal is with the territory wars and just what kind of background each character has come from. However, Marchetta eases the readers into each of the lives on Jellico road and has them wanting exactly what Taylor Markham wants - more. The book comes together like a beautiful puzzle and has Marchetta's trademark stamped all over it - characters that feel so real they could be your best friends.

It’s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that’s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It’s not the pain they’re getting over, it’s the love.
I really liked it but being honest, I was expecting to be wowed about it just because it is the most infamous and best rated Melina’s book, excepting Lumatere’s sequels. I have really enjoyed the reading. The story, the characters, the pace are good as you could expect from Melina but I found the writing in her Lumatere’s Chronicles superlative and remember Saving Francesca more captivating, even though the later is a simpler story. Still loving Merchetta, though, 
because I do love the second half
.”I think back to my dream of the boy, because in it I find solace. I like that word. I’m going to make it my word of the year. There is something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong. Belong. Long to be.I would have liked it much more if Melina had enlightened me at least about the generation of the characters earlier in the book. There were a lot of moments during the first half where I didn’t have a clue about who was who in Hanna’s book or at the territorial wars, how old they were, if they were contemporaneous or whether they were related to each other or not. Part of reason why was the mystery needed to be solved (the boy of the tree in her dreams) but another part could have been easily fixed with just a few clarifications. I might have missed the hints even if they were there for me, but I know that I’m not the only one out there being so confused and therefore fearing through almost all the first half to be put out of the story -That didn’t really happened because I enjoy trying to get my bearings in this kind of books-. I don’t think I’m spoilering anyone with some clarifications. The book is told from Taylor Markham’s -a Jellicoe Road student- point of view. Somehow her thirtysomething tutor’s past in her teenage years –at that time she was known as Narnie, but her actual name is Hannah- will has repercussions on Taylor’s life. We get Hannah’s POV in third person via a book written by her. Jellicoe Road and its summertime territorial wars against Cadets and Townies were first fought by Hannah and her friends twenty years ago, but the teens war still takes place each summer until now and those are a few of the many connecting links of both characters and stories.”We’ve lost a substantial amount of territory. It’s been split up between the Cadets and Townies.”Love the characters. All of them, but I specially loved Griggs, Webb, Ben, Santangelo and Jude in this story (warning, I’m mixing two different timelines here ;P. Don’t get lost, teehee). I know, I have mentioned almost all the male characters. Melina makes up amazing male characters, all age included!The territorial wars were also fun – they brought me back sweet memories from my childhood when I read The War of the Buttons, one of the few books my father recommended to me when I was little – … and Richard booms, “No prisoners! No prisoners! – which is ridiculous, because it’s not as if we’re going to kill them, but he has this Lawrence of Arabia obsession…” Loved the (arch-enemies’s) friendship. Love grown-ups and teens relationships. (view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier’s: ”Suddenly, I’m somewhere else, in another time. On the shoulders of a giant. I had wanted to be my father’s shoulders an all this time they were Jude’s. But he holds on to me in a way that Hannah never has. I feel his relief, like he hasn’t held someone in a long, long time. And he’s wanted to. (hide spoiler)]Loved all the love stories. They are small but so deep felt! Melina, you do write amazingly about feelings.(view spoiler)[Loved Hannah and the Brigadier’s…: He had never heard emotion from Narnie before and now… now it was so loud, so gut-wrenching that he wanted to cover his mouth with his hand. but Taylor and Jonah’s was so beautiful too! (hide spoiler)]In the end it was not the big tearjerker I was fearing of (and I’m happy that it wasn’t) so if that’s what was holding you back, that cannot be a deterrent for you either, really. As I say, you don’t really need to be looking for signs of incoming tragedy as I did. Heartbreaking past tragedies are there to overshadow Taylor Markham’s, Jonah Griggs’s (and Hanna’s) present -as it happened in Lumatere’s and Charyn’s kingdoms- but thanks to Melina I could handle all the sad events that took place in the Jellicoe Road in both timelines. (view spoiler)[Okay. I did cry a little at the last “Look at my beautiful girl” scene... but I would have thrown the kindle if Griggs had died in that damned tunnel! (hide spoiler)]Had you already had Jellicoe Road under your radar? You should read it. I think is a great read for everybody, no matter the age. Recommended to lovers of How to kill a Mockingbird, The Diary of Anne Frank and The War of the Buttons.I fall in love with this kids over and over again and my heart aches from their tragedies and marvels at their friendship.",5,default,[]

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen.”- Jellicoe Road, PrologueAnd so begins Jellicoe Road, one of the most frustrating but rewarding books i have ever read. Jellicoe Road contains many stories; the book weaves together past and present, family and mysteries, loyalty and friendship, and at times it is heartbreakingly sad.Taylor Markham has lived at a boarding school ever since she was abandoned by her mother many years ago. The story is hard to explain; one narrative takes place in the present, with Taylor trying to figure out where her closest friend and guardian, Hannah, has disappeared to.The second story is set in the past and follows four friends. The prologue is part of this second story.The flashbacks were a breath of fresh air and the way they tie in to the present-day story is simply amazing. I had figured out the twists behind When You Reach Me because I had heard there were secrets lurking in the story; I didn’t think that Jellicoe Road would have any plot twists, but when they were revealed not only was it shocking; it felt right. Not like “What the heck was the author thinking?” but “Ahhh, it makes sense.” Just what you want in this little puzzle of a book.I could barely read this book when I first started it. Actually, that’s not totally true; the introduction is simply amazing. I read the first few pages and thought that the rest of the book would be just as gripping- but instead, the plot became incredibly convoluted and confusing.The story springs right into Taylor’s life without any exposition whatsoever. Usually I love these types of stories; figuring out what’s happening is usually fun. But in this book, I was just frustrated.I couldn’t seem to care about the characters; the back story to the plot was either to brief or vague; some plot elements made absolutely no sense until the very end. I found Taylor to be an unsympathetic lead; she seemed so caught up in her teenage angst.Reading it began to feel like a tiresome trip; I tried to encourage myself to stay with it (it won the Printz award! That prologue was breathtaking!) but I eventually just gave up and put it down for a while. After wondering if the plot actually got anywhere, I picked it up again to read the ending (it’s a bad habit).And I decided to give it another try. And I was completely blown away. I couldn’t put it down; I cried like i had just read the ending of The Book Thief for the first time (well, almost).Thing is, it didn’t get that good until i was 3/4 through the book. Once I was about to read the final chapter, I actually decided to read the entire book from the beginning again to see what I had missed; it made the epilogue all the more powerful. Reading it the second time through, it almost seemed like another book. There are a whole bunch of little details that you miss the first time (mostly because what the heck is going on?!?!) but you can take the time to get to know the characters the second time through. And the characters, I find, are one of the most important elements of a novel.Final Verdict: An amazing book. The way the Marchetta ties together the past and present is nothing short of genius. The frustrating confusion at the beginning drags the book down but it’s all worth it for the ending. ---Apparently I read and reviewed this book when I was around thirteen. Every time I re-read Jellicoe it never loses its power; although I've fallen harder for Melina Marchetta's characters in other books since then (and she's easily become my favorite author), I still marvel at how everything falls into place so skillfully here. If I had to pick one novel that really stands out in being a gateway to the stories that shaped my high school years, this would be it.",5,default,"['all-time-favorites', 'i-cried', 'gorgeous-writing', 'surprisingly-good', 'best-characters', 'contemporary', 're-reading', 'oh-my-god-that-ending', 'highly-recommended']"

I started thinking about how to kick this off when I reached the halfway point in the book yesterday. I thought about starting with some kind of song. Some lyrics. Coldplay kept popping into my mind, but then I abandoned the idea and moved on. Hence, the beginning of this review is just me telling you about how I don’t know how to begin.When I don’t give a pretty great or well-loved book five stars, I like to explain why it lost that one star before I talk about how it earned the four. So I’ll start there, and even in my criticisms, I promise to be respectful of this novel and I hope I never sound as though I didn’t really love it. Because oh, how I loved it. Please don’t think me over-sensitive. There are a few things that sometimes really bug me in a book. The F-word. I don’t think it needed to be used so often. Of course I never think it’s necessary to use it at all, but I can deal with it being in there several times. But this seemed like a lot to me. I know everyone has a different conception of a lot. I just would have liked this so much better if there hadn’t been so many F-bombs. Maybe it adds realism or something for some people, but I just don’t think the F-word does anything for a story but take away from it. I’ve never said that word, I don’t much like to hear it in my head. That being said, I’d like to say that the “love scenes” were handled very well, being pretty vague. Less is more, people, less is more. I didn’t feel like my brain was being infiltrated with filth and I didn’t have to skip pages. Yay, Marchetta! If this hadn't been handled the way it was, it would have ended up being a complaint. But it's not. I applaud the author for this.And oh my goodness, these characters are wonderful. All of them. From Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, and Jude. To Taylor, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz, and even Ben. Notice that in both cases it’s a group with 3 boys and 2 girls? Ben is sort of left out sometimes, but I’m finding that rather interesting, even though it hasn’t got much bearing on the story at all. xD Can I just say right now that I love Jonah Griggs? Okay. I love him. I also love how the two different stories are interwoven. This is literary genius. It’s like a mystery but not a mystery at all. It was fun to pick apart the two stories and figure out how they fit together. It really kept me interested even through the slow parts. (view spoiler)[But I’m such a dunce that I didn’t figure out the thing about Fitz accidentally shooting Webb until the last chapter. Yeah, I am blushing about my stupidity. (hide spoiler)] Basically, I’ve go to say, this book starts out really strangely. I was totally confused through the first few chapters. But then it starts to make sense, and it just gets better the more we figure out what’s going on. If you stick with it through the odd beginning, you’ll be glad you did. Finally, I’d like to touch on what this book is, at its heart, about. It’s about grief and hurt and it’s about forgiveness. It’s about getting through the toughest times and learning to trust and love. It’s about learning to let people in.I know someday I'll read this again. I don't know how soon that day will be, but I know I'll travel down Jellicoe Road again eventually. It was a worthwhile journey. I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand.""

I am always skeptical when a book gets an overwhelming amount of rave reviews because I have been sorely disappointed too many times. No disappointment this time. JELLICOE ROAD deserves every five star review it has gotten. It took me on a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and I was sad to see it end. Taylor Markham attends a boarding school in rural Australia. She has been chosen as the student leader of her house and appointed by the graduating class to lead the school in their territory war against the Cadets and the Townies. As you can imagine, the Cadets are a military school and the Townies are the local school kids. Chaz Santangelo leads the Townies and Jonah Griggs, with whom Taylor has a mysterious past, leads the Cadets. As the territory wars heat up, Taylor’s house leader and ersatz mother, Hannah, disappears. Left with only Hannah’s unfinished memoir as a clue, Taylor teams up with Jonah to find Hannah. Their search leads Taylor to Sydney and ultimately to self-discovery. Have your tissues handy! I guarantee you will cry at least one tear when reading JELLICOE ROAD. My heart broke when I read this book, but ultimately the message was one of hope and redemption. Although it was sad and dark at times, I found it refreshing to read a YA novel that was where good things don’t just drop out of the air for the heroine. Real life isn’t like that, and boy does Taylor Markham know it. I had absolutely no idea what was going on for the first few chapters of the book. For a while I thought I was reading a dystopian novel or something. Then the fog started clear and things actually started to make sense; from then on, I was engrossed. After finishing the novel, I decided I liked how confusing everything was in the beginning. It’s a lot like Taylor herself: she didn’t really know who she was, who her family was, or why she was at the Jellicoe School. Taylor’s journey of self-discovery was paced equally with my own discovery of what the heck was happening. Ingenious! Loved that little element. Part of my confusion was about Taylor and Jonah’s past. What happened to them? How did the y meet? Who was The Hermit? What did Jonah do to his father? The details about their shared past were slowly revealed. By the time I had the entire picture of how they met and their past mistakes, I was rooting for both of them and for their budding romance. The carefully doled-out details of their history really added depth both to their character development and to their relationship development. Although I was skeptical of all the gushing reviews for JELLICOE ROAD, I am so glad I picked it up and read it. It was so very different from the YA novels I usually read and I loved JELLICOE ROAD all the more for it.",5,default,['boarding-school']

This book left me speechless.What do you want me to say? What could I possible say? It was so overpowering and magnificent that left me with no words. Seriously, I have never read a contemporary book so, so good! Melina Marchetta is beyond my understanding. First, I idolized her for the only book I read of hers, Finnikin of the Rock. Now, she absolutely left me speechless. Jellicoe Road is something else, something indescribable, something capable to marvel any reader around the world. It doesn't matter the genres you prefer nor your age or your cultural background because Jellicoe Road is capable to reach the most inner core of human being, the soul.How can so much sadness and love belong -long to be- to the same place? I wonder... how is that possible? in this book it is. Two stories masterfully intertwine on the Jellicoe Road, linking the past and the present, the characters and their stories. This book is a Road full of enriching, humane and soul-touching life experiences about self-discovery, belonging, understanding and forgiveness. This book is certainly a Road you'll want to walk by yourself and absorb everything it has to offer.I am so ashamed to say that I waited so long to read this book, but I am also proud to say that now I have this book on my shelf. I knew Jellicoe Road would amaze me, Finnikin of the Rock which is also by Melina Marchetta, highly did and I was ready to read something absolutely great in this book. However, what I did not expect was that Jellicoe Road would touch every single cell of my body with such strength that even my soul would be overpowered. The intensity of this book will absorb readers's souls and wont let them go until they shed the last tear. After that, it will be the readers that wont let go of this book.Melina Marchetta must be a writer sent by God or something, because I doubt I'll ever read something like this ever again. For me, she excels among any YA writer and Jellicoe Road is the physical proof of it. The lyrical and emotionally evocative writing style will steal your breathe countless of times. The characters, the plot and the countless themes in this story, makes this book a must-read and a must-have. I don't know what else I can say to express how I feel about this book. How can I let readers know that they should pick Jellicoe Road and read it not only once but twice, and then a third time and a fourth... Seriously, this is a book to re-read. I certainly want to walk over and over again on the Jellicoe Road.Jellicoe Road is a story that has certainly engraved itself into readers' heart and memory and it will certainly engrave its own mark through history. Now, if you haven't read this book yet, go and get it as soon as you can and turn to the first page... That is your first step to walk ""the prettiest road I'd ever seen"" (p.1) Now go and walk this inspirational, meaningful and overwhelming story on the Jellicoe Road.",5,default,"['young-adult', 'favorites', 'best-ya']"

Just like the rating scale, I feel the adjectives are limited and would not convey my truest feeling I have for this book. Ugh, this is so frustrating. If anything, this book merits recognition from the entire human population if not the universe as a whole. There, that should count for something, right?You know, if I had ever doubted Marchetta’s writing competency in the past, that feeling was now completely eradicated and I have this book to thank for that. I’m not implying she doesn’t write well because she does write well. The point is On the Jellicoe Road is so adeptly written, you’ll be reminded the reasons you worship Marchetta. This book particularly is the greatest reminder of all.On the Jellicoe Road is an engulfing read. I won’t lie to you and say that you’ll dote on the book right from the very first page because you won’t, though I have no doubt the lyrical prose will immediately pull you in. Truth be told, I was disoriented for about 100++ pages or so because I felt everything was all over the place and didn’t seem to follow the conventional storytelling. In other words, it was like reading the story from backward. But do not be disheartened by it, my fellow comrades. The unconventional storytelling is exactly what On the Jellicoe Road needsto make it an outstanding reading. As the story progresses, the plot is revealed bits by bits and when you’ve finally caught on with what’s happening, I swear to God, you’ll be so consumed in the story you’ll forget everything else that doesn’t have to do with the book. You’ll forgive Marchetta for making things so confusing in the beginning because the story as a whole is so worth the damn twisty route. I am already missing the book as we speak. This is one of the books that I wouldn't mind if it went on forever. In fact, I demand for it. I don’t know how to do this book justice, my words won’t cover even an inch of that, so I think the best way to do it is to encourage for you to read it for yourself. Except I won’t encourage. That's too mild. I will bug you until you all have given in. But seriously, give it a go.  Recommended! P.s.: Psst! Just between you and me, I think Marchetta made a pact with the Devil because this book (and all of her other books I've read) are to die for, no kidding!

But there's nothing more endearing for me than a tale about friendship, family, loss and trying to do the right thing. Last year I read Saving Francesca by Melina Marchetta, it was my first book by this writer, and while I loved her writing style and narration, I couldn't fully connect with the story, the characters were likeable and the story was full of witty remarks and smart little jokes, but still it was just an ok read, for me. But Jellico Road! oh man! this book broke my heart, but it was so worth it!Jellico Road is centered in Taylor's story, her life, we help her discover where she comes from, what mysteries surrounds her and the people around her, and how everything intertwines with her mother's childhood, her only companion Hannah, the manuscript Hannah is writing and the man that visits Taylor every night in her dreams. This book was magical, really! the atmosphere, the sadness and melancholy aspects of the story are things I've only encountered once or twice in books, and those are the sort of books you go back to from time to time, looking for that little spark of emotion that most YA contemporary lack nowadays. I love how Melina's writing is not pretentious or manipulative, even thought its a very emotional book. I feel like some authors play with our emotions and calculate every scene in their story with some sort of ""cue for crying part"" bits, they manipulate the reader and they plan every aspect of their books, and strategically place the sobfest bits in order to get a reaction from us. Melina does emotional and sadness in a effortlessly manner, and I loved that about this book. Those are the books that really catch me of guard. The only struggle I had with Jellicoe Road were the first 100 pages. It was confusing to read about all this territory wars between the schools and the Cadets, it was not very interesting to me, and I would've like it a lot more if in between all this sort of ""useless"" details we maybe get to know Taylor a bit more. Also, I think the author dedicates too much time in that aspect of the story that serves little purpose at the conclusion and resolution of the problematic in hand. Regardless of my struggles with the first part, I 100% recommend this book! I think all you need is patience and curiosity to not DNF this book. The writing style and pace makes it easy to continue reading, and once you hit the 53% ish mark, you can't put it down. I will definitely will re read this book at some point, and I'm not a big rereader, but this one deserves it. And I will definitely checkout other books by Melina Marchetta, I'm sold on discovering more of her work, if this is just a little taste of what she can do.

I’ve read books by Melina Marchetta before, the Lumatere Chronicles, but this is a contemporary novel and that was a high fantasy series. Completely different worlds, but the execution of the entire story was impeccably done in a way that left me heart broken, jubilant and full of wonder all at the same time. This book was amazing.Jellicoe Road is a book best gone into without really know what it’s about so I’m going to be very vague with the details. Its a book about loss, rivalry, death, pain, confusion, secrets, hopelessness, and fear. But its also about friendship, trust, wonder, faith, family and LOVE. While reading this book I was happy, sad, angry, afraid, confused, I laughed and cried, felt sorry for the characters in some instances and was proud of their triumphs and bravery in others. Every character in this book has a role and every single one of them plays an important part in the overall arc of the story which was a roller coaster ride in and of itself. There were times when I was reading and I felt like there were pieces of the puzzle that I had to find and fit together. And then there were times when I felt like the puzzle was already finished but I had to take it apart and examine each individual piece to really understand what was going on. It was an amazing feeling while reading. Being given little bits and pieces of information but not knowing their significance until hundreds of pages later and realizing just how important a small line or an entire passage was. Melina Marchetta did an amazing job of weaving this intricate and complicated story together in a way that kept me not only invested but actively interested in what was going on at all times. I literally could not put this book down. I had to know what was going on, I had to find the next piece of the puzzle and figure out how it fit into the overall story. An overall story about overcoming adversity and conquering your fears, learning to forgive and allowing yourself to love. An overall story that turned out to be both beautiful and tragic. I know this a very obscure review but just know that this book is definitely worth a read. If you liked Winger by Andrew Smith you will LOVE this book. And if you hated Winger you will LOVE this book. Definitely give it a try. Winger was one of my favorite books of 2014 but it pales in comparison to Jellicoe Road.This book is one of the most heartfelt and poignant books I’ve ever read with a message that is universal to anyone who reads it.

Most of the time I'm not quite sure what I'm feeling. It's some kind of overwhelming empathy and humanity and just pure raw emotion. And every time I get that feeling, I remember why I love books so much. On The Jellicoe Road definitely had that effect on me. I got into this book knowing nothing about it. Nothing at all. Nada. And for the first third of the novel, I was confused. I did not know where it was going, not even sure what was going on. Who are these people? What is this ""war"" they're talking about? What is this? But I'm actually glad I got into this book like that. The introduction was great for what it was ahead of if, the set up for the plot was beautifully done. That kind of introduction was perfect to lead to the mysteries that followed.And once again, I'm so glad I did not know anything coming in. It enhanced the experience. I took in details I may have never had thought of. This is a perfect example of the ""just get into the story without knowing what's about"" kind of book.I kind of fell in love with Marchetta's writing. Even though I was confused at the beginning, I found myself drawn to these words. I had to keep on reading. There's something mesmerizing about how she put together this story. The way the two perspectives were woven together. The darkness of it. I love YA that does not censures itself and this one definitely did not. The grimness of some of the mysteries revealed gave even more dimension to this whole story. The characters, god I love this characters so much. I fell in love with them. I care for them. I wanted so badly to things to go right all the time for them. Although the story got a bit predictive towards the middle that didn't matter cause I cared about the characters. Flawed, three-dimensional, well-written characters. And as usual for me, it was the characters that made me love the story. Plotwise, there were some elements that did not completely fit in and I wished for a more thorough explain, or an explanation at all about these holes. It's such a simple story on a base level, but it does have its intricacies and I do love me some layering.It did not hit me how much I loved and enjoyed this book until I had finished it. Until I thought about it, and the more I think of this book, the more I love it.The bittersweet after taste of that kind of book gave it away. That feeling in my gut. How my chest felt like it was expanding and no matter how much oxygen I'd take in, it wouldn't be enough for it not to be painful.

Yet I failed, which caused me to miss out on this excellent book until now. When I tried reading it previously, I was deterred by the initial chapters. Several characters are introduced and discerning the relations between them is difficult. The narrative voice and year switches without notice, and there is something about a battle between Townies, Cadets, and Houses but it's nearly impossible to figure out what it is. Later on, of course, I realized how crucial these chapters are to the story and their confusing nature sets up much of the plot; however, for a person sitting down to read this without any previous knowledge of the book, I understand why he or she may leave it unfinished. If I recommend this book to anyone (and I likely will since it's fantastic), I will reassure them that the beginning is confusing and hard but it will all make sense in a wonderful book payoff. Besides the beginning, the rest of the book is nearly flawless, except for perhaps some of the ending. Jellicoe Road is a dramatic book, but near the end, I felt like it somewhat descended to melodrama, but maybe that's just my apathetic, unfeeling self talking. I was willing to excuse it because of the book's dramatic nature; I mean, the story commences with an accident involving five fatalities. Squashed between the minorly problematic beginning and end is a glorious middle section crammed with territory games, discoveries of past stories, a magnificent love interest, and even a serial killer! When I remember this novel, though, I'll think of the friendships shared between the original five friends--Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz, and Jude (even their names are amazing)--and the modern friends--Taylor, Griggs, Santangelo, Raffy, and Ben. The adventures of the original five, though tainted with sadness, reminded me of when I was younger, traipsing around with a troop of neighborhood kids, inventing wild games from morning until the moon came up. Although none of my childhood friends died, we are no longer close, so the nostalgia and regret felt by Narnie and Jude reflected something I think all grown-up childhood friends must cope with: the loss of that idyllic time and its relationships.

For at least an hour after finishing On the Jellicoe Road last night, my head was still mulling it over, putting all the pieces in place. I actually got up and re-read some passages, and only then some of the real brilliance came through. This is probably one of those ‘very good’-on-a-first-read-but-‘outstanding’-on-a-re-read books.Melina Marchetta tackles some of the big themes in this book: About parents leaving their children, about tragic events that ripple through the rest of your life and into that of the next generation. About relationships you don’t actually know the significance of, and about the meaning of ‘home’.I do have to admit that this book didn’t have the same emotional gut-punching power her other earth-based young adult novels have (Saving Francesca, The Piper’s Son). I had heaps of Kleenex next to me, but it wasn’t necessary. The only character that came close to getting to me was ‘The Brigadier’: Clearly the good guy, taking care of all the others, desperate to belong, but even the important things he has passed onto other people, like safety and love, are being attributed to someone else in their mis-shapen memories.The story itself has 5 star potential, but I can’t shake the feeling that this book could have been so much better still. Structurally, I believe it was more confusing at the start than it needed to be. Why are we reading the manuscript as a reader before Taylor finds it? Wouldn’t it have been more logic to wait?Content-wise there are a few gaps too that don’t get explained (spoilers ahead): why did Hannah leave without saying a word – it seemed totally out of character? Why did Hannah never mention what her relationship was to Taylor – it seemed like there were many options here? I also could have done with less teen romance to be honest, because the relationship between the adults and the kids are what made this book so exquisite, and the romance angle got in the way for me.Still, it’s a really good young adult novel, and I definitely enjoyed reading it. Somewhere in the middle it became perhaps a bit predictable, but to be honest, I didn’t mind: seeing it come true was emotionally so satisfying that I would have hated any twists and turns in the plot.",5,default,['young-adult']

Finishing this book is one of the reasons that I love reading reviews before I actually read the book. If I hadn't read the reviews I wouldn't have known that every single one of them urges you to keep going--to plod through the beginning and finish the book, and I may have given up and not read past the first 30 pages or so. The first half of this book is like being the lobby of a beautiful hotel in a foreign country. You love your surroundings but you don't know what the hell is going on because no one speaks your language. Eventually the pieces in the story fall into place which allows you to slow down and focus on the words and the feelings behind them rather than spinning madly trying to figure out what is going on. I know that this is a writing technique held in high regard but between us, I thought that the book was wonderful regardless/would have been even more powerful if Marchetta had just let the reader know what was happening from the beginning. It wasn't until I understood the relationship of the characters that I was able to latch onto to them and believe that they were real. Of course, it's not my novel, so who am I to decide? And I understand in retrospect that we were learning the story in the same way that Taylor learned her own story--in bits and pieces and not in chronological order. I spent a lot of the time reading this book with that dry, scratchy feeling that your throat gets right before you are going to cry. It's pretty heartbreaking and the characters are sad in that beautiful, stilled-in-time sort of way. The only thing I can actually say that I disliked about the novel was the whole territory storyline which seemed to dominate the first half and which I didn't really understand. Why would these kids care if townies or cadets were walking on their path? It seemed like such a strange focus of their lives but I figured that maybe you have to be Australian to really appreciate the implications of another teenager invading your territory (or from Texas lol).",5,default,[]

When I read it the first time, about a year ago, I thought it was the best book I had ever read. I still love it but that honor has been replaced by Melina's most recent book ""Finnikin of the Rock"". In any case, Jellicoe Road is fantastic and a book I will cherish for a long time to come.Taylor and Jonah's relationship is INTENSE. In addition to being leaders of opposing teams in the turf war, they have history. Oh, and what a history. They met 3 years earlier and spent a few days together. These few days transformed each of their lives. The beginning of their relationship consisted of each being utterly vulnerable to one another. Even though they didn't see each other or talk in the years that followed, they couldn't possibly forget each other and what happened between them. This history makes their present day interactions heated and explosive. Despite this, there is a tenderness between them that is, at first, so subtle. You see it building through the course of the book into a love that is convincingly true. Actually, you get to see how they fell in love with each other twice, once at age 14 and then presently -- with the first fueling the second. Each of them is fiercely independent and, due to misunderstandings from their earlier history, they are so cold to each other when they meet again in the present. Reading about their relationship conjures up the image of an iceberg melting into warm, soothing spring water. You get to see how these initially strong, negative reactions to one other transform into very strong, loving, self-sacrificing openness to one another. As individuals, they each carry around so much pain. At their best, they are able to offer solace to one another in a way no else can. Loved it.",5,default,['young-adult']

I picked it up and read it. I can see why it is so well-loved. Jellicoe Road is a moving story full of heartache and hope.I'm going to keep this review short because I think it's better to go into the story knowing as little as possible. You're guaranteed to be confused but trust me when I say it's better that way. The mysterious air made the characters much memorable and the story more profound.As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of the story, I was very confused. Nevertheless I found myself completely engrossed in piecing together the stories. There was so much love but also great losses. The closer we got to the big picture, the more anxious and dread I felt. The way the story flowed made it so you know the undeniable truths but you really don't want the reality to be confirmed. Ms. Marchetta skillfully ties everything in. You don't know you needed the little details (view spoiler)[(the postman in Yass lol) (hide spoiler)] until they're given to you.The story of Jellicoe Road is thoughtful and quietly intense. There were many different types of relationships and they were all very sweet. Each subtle on the surface but overflowing with feelings at its center. ""Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love."" (p. 262).The territory war was my favourite. I love a good rivalry and seeing the boarders, Townies and Cadets in action was such good fun. They meant business but not so serious that they couldn't be friends and have some laughs together. Even if no one knew how it all started, it was a meaningful game.A book rich in emotions with excellent characterization, Jellicoe Road is a must-read for readers of all genre and all age.

Like, seriously, if you've heard that this book is complex, profound, absorbing, fascinating, gritty, depressing, and downright flawless...well, you're about to hear it again.Basically, I can't even give you a brief summary, I mean, God knows, there's enough and I just hope you're reading this to get my opinion, not hear another person give you the shortened facts. I wish I could, really, I do, but I feel if I dwell too much on the storyline, I'll completely lose sight of what made this book so magical, and that - in my opinion - is the raw emotions and feelings that a brief summary on the back of a book can't give you.I mean, gosh, it's been less than ten minutes since I finished it and I feel like a basket-case on withdrawel. I've been known to read/adore tragic books (Looking For Alaska by John Green being one of my all-time favorites) but Jellicoe Road takes tragic, depressing, shocking, and haunting to a whole new level, and if you think I'm overreacting or even not thinking straight, then you haven't read this book properly.If I had to pick one qualm about the book, it would be that you really had to perservere past the first 50 pages. Even I was ready to be all like ""Ehh, I don't know if I'll finish this"" most of the time, but I think around page 70 I realized there was no way I could put this book down, crappy or not.Pfft, I can't even talk about the characters, storyline(s), or anything, I'm still reeling.Just...read the book.

This was such a unique story. Taylor is a teenager abandoned by her mother and who now lives at a boarding school. The woman who she is most attached to disappears one day and Taylor is desperate to find out where she went. In the meantime, the school is entrenched in territory wars with students from other organizations, including one led by a boy with whom Taylor has a lot of history. Entwined in this narrative are portions of a story written by the missing woman which offer hints of Taylor’s past. I thought the teenagers were written exceptionally well. Sometimes I just don’t feel like YA authors are writing recognizable teenagers. I love teenagers and teach high schoolers and the conversations and humor that Marchetta has created were so authentic. I love the relationships that were built and the realistic portrayal of their emotions. I have already put a library hold on Marchetta’s other books and look forward to picking them up!

It is imaginative, poetic, emotional, and masterfully written. It is young adult fiction with very mature themes (e.g. childhood trauma, drug addiction, suicide, and death). The characters are broken down to the core, and from the depths of their vulnerability and resiliency, they find themselves. The first 100 pages of this book is confusing. It feels like fragments of a dream that you can’t quite piece together. Then at about 1/3 of the way through, it suddenly clicks, things start to make sense; you feel the haze lifting, and the dream is actually a nightmare that is as devastating as it is uplifting.

I read this book once and immediately re-read it the day after, as, although the layers and complexity of this book make it captivating, it also makes it a bit difficult to piece things together and remember everything. Reading it again makes me appreciate everything this book has to offer so much more. The first section of the book is a bit difficult to swallow, even for the second time reading it, with confusing details that barely make sense, but they got better, and the confusing-ness really reflects the thought process of Taylor Markham, the main character.

First, it’s been on my TBR for ~6 years. I’m glad I finally read it but damn... that hurt. Glad it lived up to the hype from people I know!The blurb doesn’t really give away much so I felt like I went in blind. I’d sell this as a young adult coming-of-age story overall. There’s a bit of romance but I found the mystery aspect the best part along with the stories of the two generations. This is a sad and beautiful story that will stay with me for a while.Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 since I initially had issues with the writing. The first 1/3 of the book felt like a slow set-up I could do away with but it got so much better after as things started unraveling. A few things also didn’t age well in this book haha (it was first published in 2006!)",3,newest,"['2021-favorites', '2021', 'favorites-young-adult']"

I flew through this book so quickly that I feel like I need to go back and savour it all again. While the beginning of OTJCR is definitely confusing and seems (almost) dystopian, PERSEVERE! After a hundred or so pages it all becomes clear, and you begin to go deeper with the characters & connect with them. It's one of the best YA novels I think I've ever read; it's real and gritty, with flawed characters that don't make all the right choices, but you at least understand why they do what they do.I'm a sucker for good character development, and I do feel like Taylor - and some of the supporting characters to a lesser extent (Jude! Jonah!)- go through quite a bit of change; I love watching as characters learn to open up and let people in. I really liked the 2 timelines, and trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle and figure it out. The more I think about it, the more parallels I can see between the 2 friend groups and their stories. (I love way the 2nd group is kind of a redemption of the 1st, and they come out even stronger). The friendships that are formed are my favourite part, I loved Chaz, Raffy, Jonah!!, and Taylor. Around 60% I did figure out the biggest ""reveal"", but I was still eager to see how the characters would find out. It's a beautifully written book about broken, hurting people and the friendships that save them. (I'm a sucker for cool friend groups, they made me think of the Marauders in a way).",0,newest,[]

I don't recommend it. From reading other reviews, I'm not alone in this thinking. This story is SUPER confusing and requires your undivided attention.

I totally didn't get that in the audiobook.I think I like the premise, but there are things about it that I just thought were pointless-like the territory wars. I still don't understand how that had any bearing on the actual story. It seemed kind of pointless and added to the confusion. The first half of the book is incredibly confusing.

Melina Marchetta did it again, she wrenched my heart. This book was really… something. It started off very confusing, not going to lie, therefore hard to stick to it. Kids talking about House leaders and territory wars and what faction owns what and Taylor’s very difficult personality and my attention span was not having it. It was also hard to differentiate what was a POV, what was a flashback and a dream, it took me until chapter 9, where our protagonist mentions one of the original 5’s name as part of a story she is reading that I realized what was what from whom. And then, Taylor grew on me just like her house girls grew on her and I understood her and where she was coming from and I just could not stop reading. I just needed to know what happened to these 5 kids and I just needed Taylor to get her answers and I needed to know how all their lives were connected. Marchetta has a talent for that, knotting people’s lives in her stories in such a beautiful way. I have so much love for Taylor and Jonah and Raffaela and Chaz and Ben and Jessa even Anson Choi and the Mullet Brothers. It was beautiful to see their friendship bloom. I had the strong need to protect every single one of these characters throughout the whole book.I am in love with the way Marchetta writes emotions, and how strongly you can feel her characters feel them. She also has a talent for presenting you a character who you might not see in a good light at the beginning and instead of giving them this miraculous redemption arc, she explains their reasons and you, without noticing, accept this character, root for them.

It was intense and gripped me so much that I almost couldn't believe it was YA fiction. It's a book centred on teenaged characters, but it feels very mature, and a lot of the subject matter is heavy and dark - I don't think I could imagine myself reading this as a teenager. I thought the way the author connected the characters and tied up all the storylines was very elegant. Half the story is written from the main character, Taylor Markham's perspective, while the other half is written in italics. At first it was really difficult to keep the two storylines and numerous characters separate, but at the end, it becomes very clear and every character is significant and has a clear connection to each storyline. I took 1 star away because I thought the ""territory war"" between the Townies and the Cadets seemed juvenile and out of place. I felt that it wasn't as realistic as it could have been, because the characters seemed so mature, and at the same time they were participating in some odd war game. I wish the plot didn't centre so much on the territory war since it was pretty insignificant near the end. Anyway - if you are a fan of YA fiction and are looking for something that is well-written and mature, I would recommend this one.

As she tries to learn and understand her new role as a leader and fight off those intending to vote her out, her past begins to catch up with her. She knows that her friend Hannah knows more about her past than she has let on, but when Hannah goes missing Taylor is left wondering just how much she knows. The leader of the cadets is Jonah, another reminder of her past that she is forced to reconcile. Trying to juggle a pretend war, school, her past, and the sudden vanishment of Hannah leaves Taylor struggling to understand herself and what's important. I found myself relating to Taylor a lot more than I thought I would. Her struggle with her mental health because of her past is relatable and heartwarming. Hannah's story is also being told during the novel, and while I enjoyed it sometimes it took me out of the story that I typically found myself right in the middle of. I was rooting for the main characters the entire time and appreciated how unique tone of voice the author had. ◦ Sexual Abuse◦ Child Neglect◦ Drug Abuse◦ Themes of Suicide ",0,newest,['books-1-10']

Grand reveals aren't as exciting when you have been waiting for the usually-smart protagonist to finally have her ""aha"" moment after waiting 200 pages (and she doesn't even figure out 75% of it by herself, the rest has to be told to her).But it was still a moving book that I can't quite bring myself to rate as three stars like I had been planning.

At times I had to really prompt myself to view all of this from my 15 year old self; reading this is as an adult is humbling. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unnatural, especially in how the boys interact with each other and it was somewhat off putting, if I were being hypercritical I’d say it perpetuates the toxic trope of men’s aggression and emotional repression.

If I searched for the finest combination of words and managed to come up with a pragmatic sentence like “this book was a primal example of top-notch storytelling”, it would be like diminishing the lengths of its emotional reach just to make it fit in a closed space of category, turn it into something you can shelve and put away, and it deserves more than that. Marchetta’s story was an orchestra of paradoxes that exploded and sunk into itself at the same time — it talked about love and hate, comfort and grief, harvesting and destruction, life and death. It talked about friendships and war and how sometimes it can only take one second for your entire world to fall apart, burn into dust. And I can’t even begin to express how reading it felt so heavy, like the weight of gravity was suddenly pressing down on me, and the cold melancholy it oozed out of every chapter frosted my fingertips and made me feel numb. I don’t know if my next sentence will make sense, but this was the type of story that makes you feel like you’ve drunk too much and that the world is moving too fast for your hungover brain to keep up with everything — which is good. Art means a whole lot more when it is capable of inciting emotions of that caliber in someone.Don’t ask me to explain the logistics of this book. It was confusing and a little nauseating at first, seeing the feud between the Cadets, the school and the Townies present itself with scattered pieces and chaotic figures. But trust me when I say that the unfolding of the thread that binds these three forces is an experience unlike anything you’ve read before. Through the painfully nostalgic perspective of Taylor, the story behind the accident that happened in Jellicoe Road and of the people who lost a family but gained another because of it appears like colorful dust in the air and reading about it is like trying to grab everything at once. But your hands get stained and there’s still so much to see and you want to consume this book all at once even though it’s so sad and inflammable that it hurts. I loved it so much but... Damn I need a walk-in-the-park of a read after it, an Emily in Paris but in book form, basically.

Jellicoe Road is insanely sentimental, and if you don't have a stomach for that kind of thing, this is a tough hang. It is the most YA book of all time, and I mean that in a lot of the good ways and all of the annoying ways that implies. It's not an exaggeration to say the main character has an emotional breakdown every five pages. The number of tears shed in this book could power a water park or keep a family alive in the desert. I'm all for tears, but when every moment is given equal hurricane-esque emotional weight, it's hard to take them as seriously. (Then again, that's basically what it's like to be in high school, so it's not like it's inaccurate.)The ending is really strong, and I think the afterglow skews the ratings a bit, because the rest of the book is less so. Then again, I am not 14 years old, and this book isn't for me :) So I should probably stop talking. If nothing else, this book is genuine and deeply felt.",3,newest,[]

At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor’s the reluctant leader of her school’s underground community, but her closest friend and mentor is Hannah, a woman who lives on the edge of the school grounds. When Hannah disappears Taylor’s search for her unveils a truth that might not just settle her past, but also change her future.The story is told in two different timelines, the past via a manuscript that Taylor finds, and the present. It’s so well-written and planned in every little detail and so suspenseful in how it slowly reveals the connections between events in the past and present times. It’s a beautiful story about friendship, but it also deals with a lot of heavy topics such as violence, death, grief, loneliness and desire to belong, suicide and self-harm.This book is so emotional and happy and sad at the same time. I had smiles and tears all over my face while reading it. It’s a book that made me suffer and that broke my heart, but it also made me so happy and I just loved every little thing about it! I cannot even try to explain how special and wonderful this book is, more than to say that I recommend it with all my heart!",0,newest,['tearjerkers']

A day and a half later, after I turned the last page of this book, I wondered how in the world I hadn't picked it up before.If you like reads where a past story mixes with the present, this one's for you. I really appreciated the flow of the book. It was easy-paced and suspenseful enough. I didn't really like the final mystery-reveal-slash-plot-twist, but it made the story all the more unique.I've got a secret love for the kind of conflict like the ""territory war"" in On the Jellicoe Road. No weapons, just teens trying to outsmart each other following the idea of a war but without casualties. In this aspect, this book has got a lot of 
The War of the Buttons
 in it.IMO, the character growth throughout the story is worth the read. The dynamics. The growing friendships. The book starts cold and progresses towards warm. I can't say more (let's avoid spoilers, shall we) but there is a beautiful underlying message of how, most of the times, conflicts are unnecessary and founded on flimsy reasons.

It's got a very interesting first line which holds a lot of promise but the following chapters are very slow and can be confusing. The author also assumes that the readers are familiar with their local school system so it contributed to my confusion too. Now the biggest problem with this book is that it took around 150-200 pages until things really make any sense and a lot of people will understandably DNF this before getting to the turning point where the book lands an impact.
“My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted.
Whether the final pivotal chapters are worth all the build up pages is really dependent on if you're reading this with others or solo. This is definitely a good book for discussion but it's also the kind of book that's very polarizing. I think this line basically sums up what kind of experience this book will take you on:
""What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?""“When we get there, you’ll understand.""

It doesn’t use exaggerated language to describe tragic events. But it describes it in simple language like it is a fact of life until it roots in you deeply. That this is, indeed, life. A culmination of ugly and beautiful things that most often we don’t get to choose. We get dealt a lot and it depends on how we play the cards. The realization crept up on me slowly, until the story settled within my skin. I couldn’t read a book for a few days after because it was hard to get this story out of my mind. And that in itself is the mark of a five-star read.I love how effortlessly Marchetta weaves the tale of Fitz, Tate, Web, Narnie and Jude that took place so long in the past alongside Taylor’s own story and interspersing it with the tiny amusements of the Territory war that allowed friendships to grow between Taylor and the contemporaries from the other school. There are enough light moments to balance the dark ones out so that the book doesn’t become a total grief fest.Read the full review here - https://thezoyaproject.com/2017/12/21...",0,newest,[]

But the journey it took to get there was just so needlessly convoluted. I just felt the construction of this story didn't work for me. It's like it was doing everything possible to confuse me by constantly flitting between present and dreams and Hannah's story, but I don't feel like it actually added anything to the overall story by doing that. Like I still guessed all the revelations and it didn't make it more impactful by confusing me the entire time, I feel like if it was told in a less random time-jump way I could've felt these moments a lot more. There's these great emotional beats at the end that honestly didn't hit me the way I knew they should have because it took so long to get to it. Also the beginning plot of their 'house wars' or whatever was as dumb as it sounded and legit led nowhere. It felt like such ridiculous forced conflict and wasn't even well explained enough for me to care. It took itself far too seriously and I found myself eye-rolling for a lot of it and waiting for the real meat of the story to happen. I also found the main relationship and Taylor herself super grating. All of their decisions are beyond frustrating and I know they're teenagers and I know they need to grow in their arc, but I didn't really find myself routing for them for most of the book. By the end I enjoyed them enough separately that I was like, 'ok sure, fine' but again didn't hit me the way I felt it should've. Overall this book was just super weird. It's certainly different and I'm all for fresh ideas, but it just didn't do it for me at all. Not my fav, but I can see why others may have enjoyed it more.",0,newest,['read-in-2020']

I ran to my library to get a copy after seeing a quote on Instagram. I had no idea that seeing that quote would lead me to my favorite book of all time! But since it was my favorite when I was just starting high school, I was scared that if I re-read it now that I’m older, it wouldn’t be my favorite anymore. I didn’t want the idealized version that I had in my head to leave, so I put off my re-read for years.Until I slipped into a reading slump and couldn’t stop thinking about it and found a beautiful new copy at a bookstore I only stumbled across and said “hey, this is fate.” And here I am at 2am clutching this masterpiece of a novel as close to my chest as possible wishing I could literally bury it physically into my heart because it was somehow so much better than the version I had in my head. I am cursing at myself for waiting so long to pick it up again and I am crying because I have too many feelings about this book.This will put you through it, okay? It will send you through such a spiral of emotions that in the end I promise you will be clutching it to your body just as I am right now and I promise that it will NEVER leave you. This is the only book I have ever read that I can just never stop thinking about.The characters are everything, the plot is everything, this book is EVERYTHING.It could be a little confusing in the beginning, but that’s only because you are trying to piece together Taylor’s life along with her. You feel every bit of emotion and confusion Taylor feels, and I think that is just the best kind of confusion.If I haven’t already convinced you, let me leave you with this: whenever I see this book in a store, I have a physical reaction. When I see it new, I literally almost cry and thank whatever god or force there is out there that the store even carries it and I clutch it and shake as I bring it up to the counter to buy it in a heartbeat. When I see it in a thrift store I have to just stand there in shock because I can’t imagine why anyone would get rid of it! And then of course I buy it even though I already have multiple copies because it is the book that makes me feel like it isn’t just a bundle of paper.

At the age of 7, Taylor was abandoned by her mom at a 7-Eleven in Jellicoe. When she was 14, Taylor attempted to run away to Sydney to find her mom. But the boy she was with called for help, and her journey was cut short. Three years later, Taylor is now the head of her House at Jellicoe school, and she must take lead in the annual territory wars between the school, the Townies and the Cadets. But when Hannah, the closest thing Taylor has to a parent, Taylor starts down a path of discovery that will reveals a tragic history on the Jellicoe Road. One that she is a part of. I truly enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed the territory wars between the three factions and how this year's leaders have entangled histories with each other. As this novel is told from Taylor's POV, it is interesting to see her view of things contrasted against the dialogue of other characters. There is a particular instance where we learn that despite Taylor's behavior, the girls in her house truly care about her. There book contains lessons on friendship, the pain and healing found in tragedy, and how a single life event can completely alter the course of ones life. The story has a few triggers. It mildly touches on drugs and the destruction they bring about, and there is one mention of child pedophilia. However, suicide plays a heavier hand in the book.Looking back on the book, I realize there are plenty of characters involved in the story that I wish we got to know a bit better. In the moment, I was caught up in Taylor's experiences, but I would have loved to know more about Jonah, Chaz and Rafaela's histories. Also, I got stuck for a moment between the epilogue and chapter 1. The book states there is a 22 year time gap, but when chapter 1 starts, Taylor is 17 years old. Took me a few minutes longer than it should have to think ""Oh, Taylor must not be one of the people involved in the epilogue.""Overall, a great read. This is the second work of Melina Marchetta I've read. I enjoy her writing style and stories, so I'll definitely be checking out her other works!",0,newest,['mandy-s-bookshelf']

I loved this book. It made me nostalgic of my childhood and reminded me of the 'gangs' we would form in my tiny primary school of just 40 kids, where each gang had a peppercorn tree as their base and there would be battles for territory and people. One gang even made a tunnel. So I found the main storyline and premise of the territory wars between the Jellicoe School, the cadets and the townies absolutely believable. Melina Marchetta can write such amazing and complex characters, and Taylor Markham is the perfect example. At times Taylor is all about Taylor, but she is also vulnerable and can bring people together. I don't even know what to write to do this book justice, there are so many good things in the mix. I was sad to finish the book and leave the characters behind (there were real tears), but I hope to return to them another time in the future.

I couldn’t really appreciate much of what went on in the earlier chapters as a twenty-year-old but it’s the kind of storytelling that would have compelled me to write more nuance to my material at that age instead of going stagnant in my later teens.Marchetta offered little distinctions to set out a clearer picture of the grounds or the characters but I take it down as personal style and it’s not like it worked against her. The focus she set upon literary devices such as a Chekhov’s Gun was pronounced enough for younger readers to appreciate without making it unnecessarily complex. The text was haunting and wistful. It’s not the kind that would have made it difficult for me to put down but if I do, I’d somehow regret it because the story is littered with bits and pieces that are easily relevant to the plot later. I did get a little annoyed at some points when something is mentioned or introduced and the reader was expected to just take that in as it is despite how slightly important it is to remember it later in the story. It was a good piece. Yet I personally didn’t appreciate how the intentionally dispersed excerpts muddled the story in a way that hindered it rather than stylise or emphasise the plot.",0,newest,[]

And I don’t quit books easily. However, at 35% percent into the story, the writer should have provided a general overview, but this novel was entirely directionless. Without the blurb, I would not have had a clue what is going on. This scene threw me off: a panel of senior students from a boarding school discussing territorial rights with the leaders of the local school kids and a neighbouring military school. In fact, the council is about access to waterways - as if any of them had any actual claim to the land. This territorial dispute is never even properly explained. The novel seems to have two main characters. On the one hand, there is Taylor, now 17 [I will never understand the trend to upgrade occupations into female first names], who at 11 was abandoned by her mother at a petrol station, and at 14 tried to run away from said boarding school to find her mother. On the run, she somehow fraternized with Jonah, a ""Cadet"" and now her antagonist. However, this backstory is structured as one big secret with only morsels of information thrown in. Taylor is also a particularly mopey, unappealing character. Yawn. Then there is Hannah, a woman in her 30s who survived a car crash as a child. She lives on the school premises and is Taylor’s friend. Somehow she is a main character, even though she has been missing since page 1. Again, lots of mysterious hints.

As much as it was heartbreakingly tragic, I enjoyed the cynical humor that the characters possessed and I found myself laughing out loud so many times.“If something happens to me, whose face will be on the front page of the paper begging for me?

Years later, she is the leader of the Jellicoe School students and is somewhat cynical due to the betrayals she has experienced throughout the years. However, she isn't the only one to face such hardships. Throughout the book, different characters face the struggles and trauma that burden them. As Taylor confronts her past, she learns more about love, friendship, and healing. Reaction: I love how the author expressed Taylor's thoughts and feelings. She is an interesting character, sharing some special quirks to which I can relate. For example, in the very first chapter, she mentions certain words that are perfect for describing her situation. That is such a small thing, but it caught my attention. Even though I appreciate her character, I am saddened by the experiences she faces in the novel. She and the other characters have some pretty serious trauma. It caused me to reflect on my own life and feel very grateful for my circumstances. Content Warnings: There are certain events such as murder, death, and suicidal thoughts. Domestic violence is also mentioned, along with side-effects of trauma, such as depression and anxiety. Some brief allusions to sexual activity. Mention of sexual assault. ",0,newest,['13-25']

The wars is very simple but the resolution of the war is not executed well I think because it just suddenly dissolves over the holiday break and also SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!! it is a not so mind blowing that the wars is just an invented game. HERE IS WHAT I LOVE, I love that all that story in the first half slowly interweaves and make sense onto the second half of the book. That is if you remember the deets in the first half. More revelations coming in which I will not spoil thats just heart warming and endearing. It is like a puzzle that you have to figure out piece by piece in order to fit. I was definitely able to predict who is who and which is which. The pace is engaging on the second half but the first half is so-so. I wish I have seen more about Tate perspective or at least a background of it. Overall I enjoyed reading it despite the trecherous first half.I HAVE TO BE HONEST this is not a wow book for me. I mean it was okay, but not the same reaction that the majority has...I get tripped off and put off by the switching of persepctive sometime. There are times I have to go back to tell who was talking. And sometimes I could not take the insensitiveness of Taylor even though she has a very tragic past and maybe a rough childhood I will not be able to justify her rudeness with those. I mean come on she supposed to be a leader right! But I felt like there are parts that she is so self centered. Yes I get that Hannah is missing and she's her rock but blowing off Jessa or Chloe like that is just I hate her in thoseI HAVE TO TALK ABOUT JONAH. I wish there were more back stories about him. I really want to know what happen between him and his father. Also I wanna know why he wanted to do what he wants to do in that train station where he met Taylor.TOWNIES, CADETS AND THE REST OF THE PLOTI wish that there are more deets about the war, how did the townies had the claim for the prayer tree and why Taylor and the Jellicoe school lost it last year. I wish they have made known that the war was an invented game not just made a party which forces all three groups to mibgke which other with no explanation whatsoever except that fact that Taylor and Jonah pashed. I hope more background on Rafaella and Santangelo to tell who they really are personally. Also again to Tate, I hope they have met properly.I know I am part of the few, but I'll tty to reread it and see if my view chabe because the book has BEAUTIFUL WRITING you can really feel the HEAVINESS OF THE EMOTIONS CLINGING ONTO THE WORDS.",0,newest,[]

I could see all the boundaries, and I could feel the summer air. I loved that this story was set in a country town of Australia, but it didn't have the usual dry Australian language to describe it - that was almost my favourite part. The characters, wow.

I've completely immersed myself the characters' incredibly realistic lives, facing horrors that they have been forced to behold. The psychological depth of the characters is insanely complex, which is probably the highlight of this book. Living in the heart of Sydney rather than the rural setting of Jellicoe Road, I don't think I ever understood how different the culture is there, and how people living in those areas see Sydney in such a different light. It was especially jarring to see familiar suburbs and australian jargon mentioned, especially since I had NO idea that this book was in any way australian. I have no idea how non-australian readers would get every single reference, like the school level system eg. ""year eleven"" or the popular TV show Home and Away. On a kind of unrelated note, Kings Cross is MUCH safer today, which is why I was so shocked at the description the book gave.I still have to say, the plot was very confusing even to the end, and the construction of the plot had little logical sense, even if it moved character arcs forward and clues into light. For example, the warring tribe system between the Cadets, Townies and the Houses absurdly seemed to be taken too seriously one moment and then the rules were very quickly ignored the next. There was a lack of motive and reason why characters chose to do certain things, like breaking into the Brigadier's tent and having a party at the Club House. These could almost be plot holes, but I'm willing to put them away as devices to make the story more efficient.Overall I'm rather conflicted on how to rate this.

Reasons why I didn’t give it more stars-predictable plot.

I think many people had this problem too and I guess it’s part of the whole setup of the book. But I think the whole subplot with the territorial wars was kinda unnecessary and boring. -romance. I think I’m in the minority here. I didnt really care much about Griggs. I kinda found their relationship boring and a bit cringe to read honestly.

(i promise you this isn't the whole plot and also it gets really confusing at the beginning.) hannah, her guardian/mentor, disappears and it sends taylor looking for clues to find her, which leads to taylor uncovering her past. all of that heaviness occurs in the midst of teenage shenanigans so it's the perfect blend of light and heavy. i liked this book. it took a while for me to vibe with it because the whole territorial wars did not make sense to me at all and quite frankly, i don't really know if it makes sense to the characters either. if you can't get past that, then i don't think the whole story is for you. in any case, i resolved to finish this book so i forced myself to get through it—which turned out to be not such a chore as marchetta's writing is easy to read and the characters and the hints at their relationships are fun. there's also the matter of shifting POVs through flashbacks, but the flashbacks are in italics so it's easy to distinguish. the whole kids in love during the summer was great and fun, but it blindsides you and leaves you vulnerable for what's to come. because when it gets to around the 250-ish page mark, that's when you know that shit is about to go down. and go down it did because the story gave me such complete heartache. i'm completely torn apart by the events at the end. the characters were great although i didn't really connect with them, i was definitely attached. i liked how the taylor/jonah/raffy/chaz friendship was written and i cried even more over ""what are you so sad about? we're going to know him for the rest of our lives."" honestly, out of the original five, jude was a surprise character for me because it hurts to think about him. he's kind of the outsider of the group, longing to be a part of it but when he does, it's under the most terrible circumstances. this book was by no means perfect. as i said, the beginning was a little difficult to get into. i may be in the minority but i didn't really care about the romance—i understand that the author draws parallels between taylor/jonah and both webb/tate and narnie/jude but uh it's not for me. they had a good enemies to lovers thing going on and a shared past but they were just okay if not a little too intense for me. it also had two sex scenes that the book could have gone without. minor things in the midst of how much the story touched me. overall, this was a good read and if you're in the mood to cry and read about deep and life-changing friendships then this is the book for you.

On The Jellicoe Road is about so many things, but at its heart it's about memory, trauma, learning to forget, and having to remember again. It's the least condescending book I have ever read - there's no all-knowing narrative voice that's telling us what's going on. Instead we try to piece things together just as Taylor does, through fragments of her childhood memories, dreams, and extracts from an unfinished book found in an unfinished house. But this book is also about other things I love to see in contemporary fiction for teens. Friendship and romance and how kids & teens find their chosen families and do everything they can to care for each other. And then there's the territory wars - this book recognizes that kids and teens have their own games, economies, traditions, and histories. I loved everything about this book. I read it over six weeks and incidentally, that's how long the plot is paced over too!

But it’s also about the beautiful memories. The memories of love from the past that keep you holding on, fighting, to see the future. This story absolutely broke me.

Despite the tragic backdrop to the story, it still feels so beautiful and uplifting to read. At first I was extremely confused with exactly what was going on, but once I learned that the territory wars are just a game, the book became a lot more easier to read. The book is about a girl named Taylor Markham whose drug-addicted mom left her with Hannah, her caretaker for the meantime. It follows her journey as she uncovers more about her past and takes part, alongside her friends, in these “territory wars” between the Cadets and the Townies. This book is very unique to me, and its style is different from anything else I’ve read. The story deals with such dark themes, yet Taylor takes these made-up territory wars with her friends very seriously. To me, it added this imaginative and whimsical nature to the book which almost felt out of place since the story gets so dark. Also, although the book was very confusing in the beginning, I actually came to appreciate that because it makes us empathize more with Taylor who’s also left in the dark with her own past.",0,newest,[]

I liked hearing the voices of Taylor, Jonah, Chaz and Raffy, and everyone else, I thought the narrator - Rebecca Macauley - did a good job of it, making different voices for everyone and her guy-voices were pretty good. Also, I noticed stuff about the characters that I hadn't before, like that Taylor was a bit of a Drama Queen, something that I had never noticed before. On the down side, the musical transitions between chapters and between past and present were too long and they got kind of annoying after a while.

blog review
.This is one of those books that 1) you should go into not knowing much of anything, 2) that will probably leave you very confused for the first 100 pages or so, but 3) is ultimately one you’ll end up loving, or at the very least appreciating the cleverness behind the structure. Preferably you’ll have read one of Melina’s other books before (and if we’re speaking of “preferably,” that book will have been Looking for Alibrandi, because I think it’s better than Saving Francesca), so you’ll know Melina’s a fine writer who knows what she’s doing and isn’t just getting sloppy.It’s hard to say what Jellicoe Road is about exactly—I don’t want your reading experience to be ruined. And anyway, even if I did tell you what it’s about, this novel has so many facets, it’s hard to give a full picture without making you sit down and read it. It’s a mystery novel about finding yourself; it’s a family story about a girl who is, for all intents and purposes, an orphan; it’s a story about friendship for a girl who always thought she was alone; and it’s about a road that, immobile as it is, is constantly changing to the eye of each beholder. It’s no wonder this novel is so confusing at first—it’s a paradox of itself.Anyway, as I was saying in the beginning, this book’s different, in structure as much as plot. There are two main storylines, one from the past—seventeen years before—and one in the present. The Past one tells the story of five teenagers who were friends, family, and couples, all of whom had special ties to the Jellicoe Road. The Present one tells the story of one lone teenage girl who’s been abandoned by her mother, who’s got no recollection of her father, and who has no other family to speak of. The Present is told in real time through Taylor’s first person narration; the Past is told through manuscript pages written by a woman who’s been like a mother—but not really a mother—to Taylor ever since she was abandoned. The book basically keeps going with each storyline until both merge and you see how they’re connected.Like I said: this isn’t a book I’ve—or you’ve, I’d wager—read before. It’s original and elusive, and, when all is said and done, brilliant. It kept me at bay, grasping for clues where there just weren’t any until everything made sense in a way I wouldn’t have guessed.I’d like to say there’s a bit in here for everyone. You’ve got your romance, your twisting-and-turning plot, your poetic prose, your instant solid characters, and your underlying passionate and solid storytelling.Possibly on my list of favorite YA books ever, probably my favorite Melina Marchetta, and definitely on my top ten for this year (US release date, of course).

She does find comfort though in a manuscript that Hannah has written about a group of five friends who met in the worst circumstances, but delved a remarkable friendship when they only had each other. When Hannah just up and leaves, Taylor doesn't understand what has happened and she becomes a wreck. Not only does she have to deal with Hannah's disappearance, but she has just been named the head of her House and the leader of the school kids in the annual territory wars against the ""Townies"" and ""Cadets."" In the war the three groups battle and negotiate following an extensive set of rules that might as well be history. As the war wages on Taylor learns to take an active role in her community as well as develop relationships that she never thought possible. Especially with Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets whom she already has quite a history with already. This war will be like no other. It will not only be between the normal three parties, but among friends, hearts desires, and most of all Taylor herself.From the title I was expecting a light and fun read. Wow, was I wrong. This book is filled with heartbreak, joy, laughter and sorrow. It completely blew me away and surpassed every expectation I had, even though I was expecting something completely different. Before I even get into the elements of the story I have to comment on how much talent the author has. Melina Marhetta's writing style is indescribable. It seemed that she was so comfortable writing the story and her words just flowed from page to page with great clarity. I loved how the author weaved many intricate details and mini-stories into one big story, making it like a puzzle that slowly comes together until those last couple of pieces which just fall into place. The only miff I had with this book is that it took me probably until the third chapter to actually understand what was going on. In the beginning there were two stories going on and it was hard to wrap my head around everything that was happening. After that though it seemed the author settled into writing and the story took off. Taylor without a doubt is one of the best characters that I think has ever been created. She has this true voice where you can hear and feel her emotion ring out. By the time the book had ended I felt like I knew Taylor like I know my best friends. While Taylor was the main character, the author did a fabulous job creating the other characters. Unlike many supporting characters, the characters in Jellicoe Road all had their own voices and became their own person with a real and likable personality. I highly recommend this book to readers everywhere. Whether you're a girl or a guy, you will treasure this novel and hold it near and dear to your heart for a long time to come. Jellicoe Road is a beautiful love story, a heart wrenching story of loss, a poignant self-discovery, and most of all an unforgettable tale. It is by far one of the best books of the year.",0,oldest,[]

It's different from Marchetta's other books. And there are also two stories going on at the same time so working that out took a few chapters. It's a sad book, yet at the same time so readable and enjoyable. Marchetta is extremely talented at creating likable characters. I actually read it twice in four days.

But I'm so disappointed to say that I couldn't get through it... It's a very odd story about Taylor, a girl who lives at a boarding school since being abandoned by her mother at age 11. Each fall, the students at the school engage in a ""war"" with the townies and a group of cadets that come to camp in the woods near the school. Each team has their own territory, and there are constant skirmishes between the groups. Taylor is appointed the leader of her group, so the book is divided into a plotline about the battle, but interspersed with stuff about Taylor's past life and the mystery behind her mom's disappearance.

She wrote a very popular book called Looking for Alibrandi which is studied by most high school students. Marchetta has a gift for exploring themes relevant to teenagers and this is shown in another of her novels, Saving Francesca, and now On the Jellicoe Road as well.On the Jellicoe Road is about the life of a young girl named Taylor who is abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road and becomes resident of a nearby boarding school. She develops a close relationship with the woman who found her, Hannah, but when Hannah disappears, Taylor's world starts to crumble, and she realises she must find out what happened to her own mother.The plot actually goes much deeper than what I've described, and for the first half of the book, it's rather a confusing process trying to follow the characters (there is a separate story running throughout and it takes a while to get the gist of what's going on).

Taylor also has to deal with Jonah Griggs, a cadet she ran away with in year seven, who betrayed her. Now he is the leader of the Cadets and anger from the past resurfaces as well as feelings neither of them can explain. On Jellicoe road you find the importance of friendship, the gutt-wrenching loss of family, and the ever present element of love.

I found the whole ultra-mysterious 'brooding' tone pretentious and the romance between the characters was too melodramatic for my taste. Although I'm sure it will ring true for adolescent girls everywhere who will no doubt be all 'OMG I can totally relate to Taylor because she is like, so INTENSE and has had so much EMOTIONAL TRAUMA in her life, just like ME!'Besides that, though, I thought the mystery part of it was poorly done. A lot of people are saying in their reviews that they found it 'confusing', at least at first - and it is.

I counted. It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,"" and that was the last thing he ever said. We heard her almost straightaway. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead--just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives. Someone asked us later, ""Didn't you wonder why no one came across you sooner?"" Did I wonder? When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they're some kind of garbage, don't you know? Wonder dies.Powerful, isn't it? I won't lie...Jellicoe Road is a difficult read in many different ways. But worth it? Yes! Resoundingly yes! Why is it difficult? It weaves two stories together. The stories are seemingly unconnected...at least in the beginning. And because you--the reader--don't know what is going on...it's easy to get frustrated. Easy to get confused. We've got the past--from which the prologue serves as an introduction--and the present. (In a way it reminds me of Tamar.)The present. We've got several teens whose lives intersect--Taylor Markham, Ben Cassidy, Jonah Griggs, Chaz Santangelo, Raffaela, Jessa McKenzie--of whom Taylor is the main character. Taylor doesn't know where she fits in, ""One day when I was eleven, my mother drove me out here and while I was in the toilets at the 7-Eleven on the Jellicoe Road, she drove off and left me there. It becomes one of those defining moments in your life, when your mother does that. It's not as if I don't forgive her, because I do"" (20). Taylor is one of many students at Jellicoe School, a boarding school; she's the leader of her dorm or ""house"". (There are six houses.) And the school tradition is that there are ""wars"" between three sects--those that live at the boarding school (led by Taylor), the Townies (led by Chaz Santangelo), and the Cadets (led by Jonah Griggs). These wars involve territories. And these games last six weeks or so. And they're a big deal for those involved. But what at first seems like a senseless, pointless book on children playing war--tactical strategies, trapping, pranking, and such--soon turns into an emotional journey of the heart, soul, and mind.Taylor Markham is concerned, worried, anxious about Hannah, a woman who is the closest thing she has to family, when she disappears without a word. One day she's there, the next day she's gone. And Taylor can't get a straight word out of any of the adults around at the school or in the town about Hannah's whereabouts. Taylor--though Hannah is still missing--likes to take refuge in Hannah's house. She loves to read Hannah's manuscript, for example, which is the story of five kids who live on Jellicoe Road: Tate, Narnie, Webb, Fitz, and Jude.I don't want to spoil this one in any way. But I think this *may* help readers out a bit. I didn't catch on that the italicized portions--the stories of Tate, Webb, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, etc.--were written down stories. That Taylor was reading something Hannah had written down. I'm still not sure all of them are meant to be. But I think some of them are. And it is these stories which help Taylor to piece everything all together. (I had assumed that they were flashbacks. That they were there for the reader's benefit, but not for the characters within the book.)This is a book that had to grow on me. It wasn't one that I knew I would love--or thought I would love--from the very first page. But by the time the story comes together, by the finale, it had me completely won over. The story is intricately told and well written. Haunting, yes. Bittersweet, definitely. But one that I think is worth reading and recommending.© Becky Laney of Becky's Book Reviews ",3,oldest,[]

I love the poetry, the mystery, and the fact that it's meant for ""young adults."" I bought this book while in Australia, read it when I was slaving away for an English family cleaning house and horse stalls for a few weeks, and cried like a baby all the way through. Since then I've read it probably six more times. It's not very long, and was an easy read out loud to my roommates (they said they enjoyed it, I swear). The story takes place out in the ""bush"" of Southeastern Australia and delves into the emotional plight of two generations of teenagers from this town, which all stems from one horrible car wreck that happened along the Jellicoe Road. Although the beginning is confusing at first, it's well written, super fun, and incredibly tragic. ",0,oldest,[]

I didn't find the characters compelling or interesting. To be totally honest, I thought it was quite predictable. Although I clearly didn't figure out *everything* at the end, I knew from page 5 that the characters in the manuscript were somehow the ones acting in Taylor's history. So, that said, no shock.I thought that there was no reason to care about Taylor. We know little about her for 300 pages, except that she's got mommy fixation. Even in the end, I still didn't care about Taylor nor understand why I should care about her. I felt like the last 100 pages were the best in the book in terms of writing, action, and story. I wish a lot at the start could have been cut OR could have been better fleshed out in terms of character development. I think there were too many characters without any defining features who just became names to me. All of that said, I think this book definitely would have its readers. I think a lot of reluctant readers would have a hard time with this one because it requires reading the whole book. I think it might even require two readings. In terms of writing, Marchetta can paint some nice images for sure. She can also paint quite brutal ones. Sensitive readers might be put off by this one, since it's quite brutal in parts. Alas, the book earns a 3 star because I might, in the future, reread it to see if I missed something. If a book I don't care for a whole lot can compel me to consider rereading, then maybe something's there. I'm not quite sure why this one, out of many other great contenders, achieved the Prinz.

Taylor Markham, a 17-year-old who was abandoned years ago by her mother, takes on leadership of the boarding school's six Houses. Plagued with doubts about being boss, she's not sure she can handle her Cadet counterpart, Jonah Griggs, whom she met several years before while running away to find her mother. When Hannah, a sort of house mother who has taken Taylor under her wing, disappears, Taylor puzzles over the book manuscript the woman left behind. Hannah's tale involves a tragic car accident on the Jellicoe Road more than 20 years earlier. Only three children survived, and Taylor discovers that this trio, plus a Cadet and a Townie, developed an epic friendship that was the foundation of the many mysteries in her life and identity, as well as of the war games. While the novel might put off casual readers, patient, thoughtful teens will remain to extract clues from the interwoven scraps of Hannah's narrative, just as Taylor does, all the while seeing the collapse of the barriers erected among the three groups over the years. Elegiac passages and a complex structure create a somewhat dense, melancholic narrative with elements of romance, mystery, and realistic fiction.-Suzanne Gordon, Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GA Copyright 2008 Reed Business Information.""",0,oldest,[]

Marchetta reveals just a little at a time and you need to know the whole story just as much as the protagonist. It's brilliant!I know this doesn't say much about the plot or what the book is about... but as others have said, this is a book you just have to read to understand. I was a bit lost for the first half of the book, trying to figure out what the heck was going on, and how these two different stories relate to each other. Once I made some connections, I couldn't put it down. Once you get past the initial feeling of ""What the heck is going on and why should I care about it?"" you transition to the feeling of ""Now I really need to know what's going on!"" Getting past the confusion and finally investing in the characters is absolutely worth it to see everything unravel and piece back together in the end. ",0,oldest,"['must-read', 'read-in-2009']"

I am a sucker for braided narratives; they read like a mystery novel for me. This was a great one. I found myself jotting notes to try to figure out how the plot lines connected long before it was evident there was much of a connection. I think that once students get into it (it does take a while for some, although I was instantly hooked) they will feel the same and try to think about how it will fit as well.So, assuming that not all teens are as into that aspect as I am, why else would this appeal to students? The novel begins with a brutal accident, one that can't help but make you root for the children who were left behind. On the other hand, the book is full of the closest types of friendships forming... The kinds of friendships that become family, whether out of need (as is shown here) or just because everyone needs that kind of bond. High school students are beginning to experience that, and to see groups of peers so passionate about friendship is something everyone can relate to... even if it's just something they have always wanted.However, I quickly learned that not everyone was as invested in reading this book as I was. Many of my classmates found the first hundred or so pages to be very confusing and therefore lost interest. For this reason, I would only really recommend it to students who love to read already. In addition, the ""war"" seems really pointless. Yes, it is explained later in the novel, but it actually makes most reviews sound like it's a science fiction novel or something, and it isn't at all. I think that this plot device, and the scant purpose for it, would distract and annoy many readers.The biggest asset to the best young adult literature is a believable cast of characters, and Marchetta is a little bit hit-or-miss on this one. Some, such as Taylor & Hannah, are incredibly believable. On the other hand, because so little is really known about all of the older cast of characters (particularly Fritz and Jude), these sometimes come off as flat characters, barely more than cardboard stand-ins.To encourage students to read this novel, I would suggest it readily to those who are fans of John Green's Looking for Alaska. Like that already-popular novel, Jellicoe Road addresses boundaries (perhaps more literally) and finding oneself, as well as coping with losses and finding meaning in others. Additionally, the more I read, the more Narnie reminded me of Melinda Sorvino in Laurie Halse Anderson's novel Speak. I was relieved to see that like Melinda, Narnie pulled herself together when crisis dictated that need.",0,oldest,"['ztlib', 'young-adult', 'vomit-less-romance', 'great-ya', 'mental-illness']"

The hype was pretty impossible to live up to. But it's an incredibly well written book, full of complicated characters, with a story that will grip you before you ever figure out what's going on.(I ended up reading this in one sleepy go, trying to stay awake all night at the train station - turns out that when they say the train leaves at 11:20, they mean it.

At one time I began to write down the names of everyone to link them to lovers, friends and family members, so I could remain focus and solve the mystery for myself. Never at any point did I think Jessa’s father was the Hermit…Marchetta was very careful to throw my sent. I do have to admit my mouth did drop, when Marchetta described the love-making scenes, while I did not think they were written too graphically I was just surprised by the elaborate words of anger, and sadness mixed with love. I guess, I found it surprisingly accurate compared to other writings where it is so romantic and over-rated. I liked the fact Marchetta wrote so ‘Raw’ and organic. Because this book was so hard to get into, I would only recommend it to Teens or people who LOVE to read. There was just so much detail lost about the Territory Wars, I was confused for the first 100 pages.

Each Summer, the boarding school kids participate in territory wars with the Cadets (Summer camp attendees from the military academy in Sydney) and the Townies (kids from the local town.) The novel begins with a flash-back that grabs the reader’s attention immediately, however, when chapter 1 begins it is slightly disorienting and it takes a few pages for the reader to orient themselves in the world of Taylor. There is a mystery embedded in the narrative that may initially cause confusion among readers, but those who stick with the storyline will be highly rewarded.

Almost all the adults in this book are totally irresponsible. I do not believe for one instant that two of the adult figures would have kept Taylor so far at arms (or longer) length. That the school is set up as it is with so few authority figures or people in charge is bogus. And the daily responsibilities of these teens are somehow not even a little in the way of the other things going on in their lives. That said. The plotting and the structure of this book are so interesting. Looking at other reviews, most readers complain that the first 100 pages are confusing (I agree). I don't think that was an accident. It is amusing to me that so many readers are so put off by that.

However, it was definitely a bit confusing switching from one to the next. There were also a lot of characters and with the different plot lines I was lost half the time.

I did like the ending of this book, but don't want to give it away so I'll just say it was very appropriate. The biggest appeal of Jellicoe Road lies in the settings, both past and present, and the vivid description of Jellicoe Road.I think this book may be a bit difficult for young adults, but who am I to say a child cannot handle a book? It just depends what each teen likes in books and if they can follow a confusing book, then I would recommend it to them! The characters are believable, but there are just so many of them to sort out. I would promote this book to teens when doing a unit on Australia. It is a rather historical book that mentions many cities and towns of Australia.

A few months later, I decided to give it another chance and I’m glad I did. This time I was enchanted by Taylor Markham and the almost magical outback world she inhabits. Marchetta has beautifully interwoven the scattered stories of Narnie, et al. with Taylor’s present, creating a subtle, but increasingly urgent, mystery for both Taylor and the reader. Clues dropped earlier in the novel don’t become apparent until the end when all the dialogue, memories, and interactions of the characters come together. In Jellicoe and its environs, she has created a tremendous sense of place that grounds the story and becomes its own character of sorts. The territory wars between the students, the townies, and the cadets reinforce the importance of place in the book.

Marchetta is a master at spooling out details, things that seem insignificant, until they suddenly become very important. She does this in such a way that although you may not take very much notice of this or that small detail, when the revelations come, you remember what came before very clearly - so that the process of piecing these stories together isn't a strain on your memory or patience. Marchetta has always been one of my favorite authors in terms of what she understands about teenage girls, and she manages to get humor, sorrow,love, action, romance, and mystery all packed in, without being melodramatic or overbearing.Please, please give this book a chance - you'll be well rewarded if you stick it out.",0,oldest,[]

The book deals with the following developmental markers: surviving on your own/becoming independent, reconciling with your past, developing positive adult relationships, forgiveness, and understanding. I thought that the characters were believable. Taylor really appealed to me and drew me into the story. I wanted her to do well and succeed. I also liked the relationships amongst the characters; I thought they were realistic and believable. I was a bit doubtful that there would really be “territory wars” as described in the book, but upon understanding the history behind their creation, I can see how that would really happen too. In a sense, Taylor’s experiences could be a representation for the types of conflict that occur on a much larger scale around the world. I would promote this book in conjunction with other similarly themed novels: The Outsiders, Miracle’s Boys, or Westside Story, etc. I think that describing the basic plot and the way in which Marchetta has established the plot structure would be enough to entice a reader to want to pick the book up.

But slowly - very slowly - the mysteries and romance and action of the story reveal themselves. For this reason I think many teens, without direction, will give up on it. It takes a sophisticated reader. It would help the reader simply to know that the pages in italics are from a book that one of the main characters is writing, and that the pages in regular font are from the present. Marchetta is clearly the master of the slow, careful reveal. I was literally gasping out loud by the end of the book as everything came together. And talk about loving and investing in characters! Wow! You love them all by the end, flaws and all - Taylor, Jonah, Raffaela, Santangelo, Jessa, Narnie, Tate, Webb, Fitz, and Jude. The writing and imagery are stunning as well. The book is set in Australia; therefore, there are some terms that American readers may struggle with - though most can be figured out from context (ie; singlet).The book is first and foremost about friendship and the love that binds true friends together.

I would recommend this book to a teen who might be struggling with family/roots problems since Taylor can remember very little of her mother and father and is the main reason she is kind of closed off to everyone she meets.

Taylor must now figure out how her past is linked with Hannah's and five children who attended the Jellicoe School before Taylor was born.Teens will like the depth of this book. It follows several story lines, which, while they may be confusing at first, all tie together at the end. Aspects of the work that may appeal to teens include the romance between Taylor and Jonas, a cadet who camps near the school, and the sense of adventure that fills the pages of Jellicoe Road.As Taylor pieces together they mystery of her past, she learns things about human nature that she will never forget.

The first chapter left me awestruck- it was an incredible beginning. However, the next 100 pages are comprised of two stories that swirl around one main character who frankly, is less than likable in the beginning. After the 200 page mark, it is apparent that the structure emulates the main character's confusion- the reader is already beginning to piece together what the main character is beginning to suspect. It is tedious work, but the payoff is worth it- once the story picks up and the characters begin to interact, the story is quite enjoyable. I took off one star for two reasons. One is due to editing. I felt that structurally, the reader could relate to the main story of Jellicoe Road, but the reader never really relates to the secondary story. With as many pages and development allocated by the writer, there should have been more development or in my opinion, less of the secondary story except in the development of the main story (I'm trying to write this without spoiling anything here). There are also some basic mistakes, as noted in other reviews- the ethnicity of one character contradicts itself, there are unexplained lapses in time during scenes, and so on.Finally, this is supposed to be an award-winning book, with an emphasis on literary achievement. While Jellicoe Road does not lack this, I personally see this book as having a rather limited teen audience. I work in a public library, and there is a certain type of teen who would be willing to put in the effort to navigate the complexities of this novel- a novel that is sometimes overly complex and at times somewhat inaccessible. I worked through the first third of the book because it was a Printz winner, and I felt an obligation to finish it. I wonder if teens would do the same- it's not difficult, but it can be a chore. And who wants to make their leisure reading a chore? (This isn't me advocating Twilight for the Printz award, but really, let's take into account the audience of a book, and not just what adults/professionals think).

It kept me up waaay past my bedtime last night. Marchetta's book--simply titled Jellicoe Road on my hardcover--recently won the Printz Award for best Young Adult book of 2008, so I read it to see why. The story that starts the book, about kids who lose their parents in a terrible car accident and bond with their rescuer, another kid, plus a second new friend, turns out to be a kind of framing device, or maybe a prequel, woven through the current story of Taylor Markham. Taylor lives at the Jellicoe School, and she's the new leader of the school crowd. Together with two other groups--the Townies and the Cadets--the teens fight silent, sometimes vicious battles for territory, all without any of the adults knowing. But mysteries abound: Why has kind neighbor Hannah disappeared? Is the Brigadier a hero or a villain? What did the Hermit say to Taylor right before he killed himself? What happened to Webb? And why did Cadet leader Jonah Griggs call the school after he and Taylor ran away three years ago? Most important, who is Taylor Markham, and can she overcome her own darkness, let alone the darkness of the territory wars? The unwinding of all these mysteries makes for a painfully rich read. If I take a big step back, I might say that all of the tangled subplots in Jellicoe Road are kind of melodramatic. But I can't take that step back, and I don't want to--I'm too busy caring about Taylor and her friends.

After reading and hearing accolades about this book, I'm so thrilled to say that I loved it. So beautiful, strange, and heart-wrenching. Excellent teen literature and one of the best books I've read in awhile. Taylor Markham is 11 years old when her mother leaves her at a 7-11 on Jellicoe Road in rural Australia and Hannah finds her. Now 17, she's in her last year at the local boarding school, where Hannah is her house's mentor and the closest thing she has had to a mother. The territory wars between her school, the Cadets, and the Townies are about to begin, and the seniors will be choosing a new leader for Jellicoe School. Hardened by her mother's abandonment and her hidden yearning to belong, Taylor is not the popular choice but is chosen nonetheless. But when Hannah disappears and Jonah Griggs, now cadet leader, reenters her life, Taylor is forced to face her mysterious past and her buried emotions if she wants to have a say in her future.  That synopsis only skims the surface of this complex and multi-faceted novel. There's so much more which is best left to be anticipated. I don't think any summary of Jellicoe Road and its unique premise can really do it justice without including spoilers. I came into it knowing that it may be confusing and hard to sink your teeth into. But being aware of this only made it seem less cumbersome and more promising because I had so much faith that the slow, gradual build-up would be worth it. I did need to re-read several passages as I went along and I know that I still missed some dropped hints, but it was more than worth it. I was awestruck at how the seemingly disparate narrative pieces and disconnected cast of characters all subtly fell into place at the turn of each page until the very last. I'll have to take back some of the times I've said this or that book had a perfect ending, because this one was truly perfect in the way it ties up the story and rewards its reader. I cried and relished it. As a side note writers take note: Marchetta's prologue and epilogue are stellar. I will with pleasure be re-reading this book. ",3,oldest,['young-adult']

In the past they have chosen some truly aMAZing books (like ""The White Darkness"" or ""Looking for Alaska"") some not so much my favorites but still, they always choose books just a little bit different, which is what I really like. Each book tends to deal with difficult issues surrounding teens that take my breath away and never fail to get me thinking. 2009's choice is no light-weight either. I've actually had ""Jellicoe Road"" in my TBR pile for several months now and just haven't had a chance to pick it up. Now that I've finished it, I'm just kicking myself for not reading it sooner. Taylor Markham is head of her house at the Jellicoe School, where many of the students, like her, are orphans or have been abandoned by their parents. Taylor was brought to Jellicoe School by the mysterious Hannah after her mom left her at a 7-11 when she was 11. Each year, the students fight the Cadets, who camp near the school for several weeks and the Townies in a type of territory 'war' that determines control over various trails, streams and buildings in the bush. This year, Taylor has been selected as the school's leader and is more than reticent to participate. Then Hannah unexpectedly disappears and Taylor knows it's connected to the disappearance of her mother and will stop at nothing to find out more. Joined by other students, the mysterious Cadet leader Jonah Griggs, and the Townie Santangelo, Taylor slowly unravels the story of her past and the stories of those she loves most.To be competely honest, for the first part of the book I was pretty lost. There are several storylines and everyone seemed to have 'history' which made for some confusing reading. But knowing how many people have raved about it, I just kept reading hoping to make sense of it all. And it did. Taylor's story came together with such unexpected beauty that I found myself totally intrigued by each new revelation and it's effect on Taylor and her friends. That's not to say I missed some things along the way - I actually had to reread several parts after finishing becuase I totally missed one major revelation. Oops. But I can't say enough good about this book: there is such heartbreaking sadness, wonder and hope found here that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

This novel is utterly confusing until you get deep into the plot. Once you really realize that there are two stories being told, Taylor's story of her the time when she meets Jonah and forms a deep relationship, and the second is the story of Webb, Tate, Narnie, Fitz and Jude whose lives are interwoven following a tragic accident on Jellicoe Road. What makes the story difficult to follow is the fact that it isn't written in a chronilogical format. The reader, if in a classroom setting, might benefit from keeping notes on the characters or a timeline of events in each character's life. I didn't realize until late in the story that Taylor would meet her mother again, which is the perfect ending to the most confusing story I've read. Making a family tree visual prior to reading in the classroom, would offer meaning for the reader of the families and the conflict that exists. Marchetta deals with so many themes, it will be a long study for the class who takes on this book. The students or the reader will be forced to think about family relationships and roles. The reader will see many examples of friendships, both good and bad, which will lead to issues of loyalty. I also wanted to know more about the parents of these children. What parenting roles are to be modeled or emulated and what parental roles would we like to broach and forget? Children are often forced, too soon, to deal with the harshness life can offer with death's grief and with the possibility of abandonment by parents for whatever reasons. This would be an incredible book to use in order to study relationships. I would have to recommend that the teacher read it several times so as not to miss the many messages twisted into the plot and to be able to guide the reader through the issues creatively. Not an easy read is Jellicoe Road, but a most challenging and interesting one. Still, it is not one I would just pick up for pleasure, I would have to have encouragement or pressure if I were a student today. These are relevant topics in the game of life that all adolescents should embrace. This book may be very difficult for the suffering kid. It wouldn't be possible for the struggling reader.5Q 3P S",0,oldest,['printz-award-books']

The skirmishing is artificial and thus takes way too much effort to maintain - so the blossoming friendships between the groups take center stage, as does the mysterious connection between a tragic event 20 years ago and main character Taylor, a girl with a big chip on her shoulder.

While she can be assertive and brash, she is also often sullen and withdrawn. She has just been appointed leader of her school's campaign in the annual ""Territory Wars"" between the Jellicoe School, the Townies who go to school in town, and the Cadets, whose military school camps out in the bush near the Jellicoe Road to do training exercises. The Territory Wars are kind of a hassle, really, but they can't be dismissed, for they determine who can go where, and they're a tradition that dates back quite a while. It's all quite stressful for Taylor. It just so happens that the one adult she trusts--the one adult who cares for her, who found her after she had been abandoned by her mother, and who brought her to the Jellicoe School in the first place--just disappears one day, and does not leave Taylor with any readon for why she's left Jellicoe nor where she's gone. So Taylor is in a rather unsettled state, a state not particularly conducive to leading her school in the Territory Wars nor negotiating with the leaders of the Townies and Cadets.The Territory Wars are all quite interesting, and they seem uniquely Australian, or maybe they're just unique, but ultimately the book is not about them. Taylor, who knows very little about her past (and what she does know is repressed), starts to piece together a narrative that explains who her parents were, how she came to be abandoned, and the backstory which led to the creation of the Territory Wars. This is a fantastic book. There's a lot of tragedy in this story. But ultimately there's a lot of love, too. Reading this book will make you appreciate your family just a little bit more than you already do. You'll want to go back and look at photos of your parents when they were teenagers. You'll think about all your relatives' stories about their adventures growing up. I loved this book. Terrific writing and terrific story.

While I still felt it took too long to feel attached to the characters, the story did eventually draw me in. I enjoyed the parallels that are drawn between Taylor and her group of friends (which includes Jellicoe students, Townies, and a Cadet) and Taylor's parents and their group of friends (which included Jellicoe students, a Townie, and a Cadet) and how Taylor learned about her family's history. A well-constructed plot and intriguing conflicts make for a compelling story, but the slow build-up is likely to make this a tough sell for most teens.---------INITIAL REVIEW FROM MARCH 2009:Okay... to be honest, I didn't finish this book. I didn't even get past Chapter 6. But I tried to WANT to read it for almost two weeks before finally giving up today. I'm sure the Printz Award Committee had their reasons for selecting it for this year's winner, but I just couldn't get into the story. I didn't feel any connection to the main character, or any of the characters really, and I wasn't even really intrigued by the ""mystery"" of how the territory wars began. I tried. I really did.

The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.-------------------------------With a beginning like that, how could you put it down? Well, I did, two times, but the third time…well…wow. Every once in awhile, a book comes along that just hits you in the gut. It hits too close to home, it tears your heart out, it grabs you by the roots of your hair and spins and doesn’t turn loose until well after the last page has been turned. Jellicoe Road did all these things to me and so much more.Taylor Markham has been living at the Jellicoe Road boarding school since her mother abandoned her at the nearby 7-Eleven six years earlier. She doesn’t really know what happened to her father; only that he has been gone for most of her life. Now she’s seventeen has been newly elected to the post of student leader of her dorm and to lead the Underground Community as one of the three boarding schools who battle for territory (among other things) in her small Australian community. The two other gangs are called the Cadets and the Townies. For years these three camps have fought in the “Territory Wars;” wars fought over land, trees, water, and more. Everything is going swimmingly, until Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family disappears without a word. Jonah Griggs, the boy Taylor ran away with three years ago and the leader of the Cadets has popped back into her life with smoldering looks and mystifying behavior. And all the young kids of Taylor’s house are now looking to her for everything. Things start falling apart.Understandably Taylor wants to know what’s going on with Hannah. We are given glimpses of a novel that Hannah has been working on, which at first Taylor takes to be fictional but quickly realizes that it might not be so fictional. It provides an all important glimpse of Hannah’s, and Taylor’s, life. As she gets closer and closer to the truth the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together and, well, good luck putting the book down. This is an absorbing story where nothing is quite what it seems and the clues only lead to more questions for Taylor, as she tries to work out the connections between herself, Hannah, her mother and the character’s in Hannah’s book. This is a book about secrets, anguish, pain, love, betrayal, hope, death, life and oh so much more. It’s heartbreaking and beautiful. It’s gorgeous and haunting. It’s going to live with me for a long time, I’m sure. I’m so glad I gave it that third try.Oh and this is important. Jellicoe Road won the Printz Award!",0,oldest,"['2009', 'fiction', 'young-adult']"

There are two different sets of characters, one group from the past, and a contemporary one, with no clues as to how they fit together, complicated by the fact that the characters' names are Australian and not obvious (at least to this American) which ones belong to boys, and which ones to girls. You learn right off that there was a car accident that brought five kids together in the past, and that there's a girl named Taylor trying to figure out what they have to do with her now. Fortunately, the plot is strong enough and rewarding enough to be worth it. I got to the end, and just as many other reviewers have said, immediately started again from the beginning.The main character is Taylor, a GIRL, and a student at the boarding school on Jellicoe Road. She's almost an orphan, and lives there year-round, since her mother left her at the age of nine. But Taylor knows there's a lot about her mother's life she doesn't know, and the READER knows it must have something to do with that other timeline. The hard part, the part that takes patience, is reading far enough into the book to find out how.In the meantime, the students of the boarding school are in a complicated wargame they play every year, with the townies and the cadets over territory, that is both fascinating and amusing. Adding to the fun, the intimidating leader of the cadets has a history with Taylor, leader of the students, and the leader of the townies has a history with Taylor's second in command, Raffaela. Oh! And there's a serial killer of kids lurking in the background of the story, too. Listen, just GO with it.

It’s also the most rewarding. After being held hostage by the king of all hooks in the prologue (“My father took 132 minutes to die. I counted...”), I expected the plot to unfold quickly thereafter. Instead, the mysterious plot slowly inched forward by cleverly moving backward. This story shares the lives of a group of downtrodden, neglected teenagers – many wards of the state – attending the Jellicoe School out in the “boondocks.” Since so few have parents in their lives, they come to depend highly on one another. Teenagers in the town have created territories and proclaimed war against opposing groups. In addition to dealing with territory disputes, seized hostages and keeping the girls of her house safe, Taylor Markham is struggling to contain the demons of her miserable past, unstable present and unpredictable future. At seemingly every turn, she finds battles to fight, drama to tame and an unlikely romance to decipher. But Taylor’s biggest distraction is trying to solve the painful mysteries of her past. Melina Marchetta has written an absolute masterpiece. Appreciating this story requires an extremely patient reader who is willing to reread confusing parts several times over. Marchetta challenges her readers to make higher-level connections most authors wouldn’t dare try in fear of losing their readers too soon. You may find yourself completely lost 200 and even 300 pages into this story but stick it out to the end. The book is like a puzzle with 419 pieces. Each piece of the page (i.e., each page) must be carefully considered and pieced together in the correct context in order to be fully understood. As you make it toward the end of the book, you will recall scenes throughout the story that previously had you wondering, “What in the world is going on?” and you will say aloud, “Oooohhh!! I get it now. WOW!” When, late in the story, the author began dropping subtle clues to make sense of earlier scenes, my eyes continually widened and my jaw constantly dropped - and my heart even pounded at times! Once completed, you will experience a moving story that will force you to break out the tissues and to applaud Marchetta’s brilliant storytelling. Jellicoe Road is oftentimes devastating, sometimes humorous and steadily mysterious. It is an intricate, complicated story that could easily be used as part of a college-level literature course. I decided to read the book because I came across Jellicoe Road as I was trying to find good books to read on Goodreads. I noticed Jellicoe Road scored a high rating on Goodreads, so I gave it a try. While a select handful of 8th graders might be able to tackle and interpret this story, I would recommend this story mainly for advanced avid readers, high school and above.

She does not know much about her past and only has a few scattered memories of her early childhood. When she was eleven, her mother abandoned her at a gas station and a woman who lives next to her school picked her up and brought her to the school. Taylor knows that Hannah has some connection to her past, and worries when she disappears without letting Taylor know where she is going or when she will be back. While Taylor worries about her mysterious past and Hannah’s location, she is also supposed to be leading her school in the annual territory wars between the townies and visiting cadets. She is also perplexed by unsettling dreams and a story about five friends who used to go to her school. Can Taylor figure out her past and not let her school down? Or will she cave under the stress?Like many people have said, this book begins slowly, but picks up as the novel progresses and the storylines start coming together. I think that the characters and plot could be appealing to some teens, particularly those who like a challenge and appreciate lots of description.

Our heroine Taylor is tough, a bit prickly, and yet vulnerable. Honestly, what kept me going was the mystery surrounding her intense relationship with her should-be enemy, Jonah Griggs. I found the side-plot/interruptions by Hannah's writing to be a tad annoying and yet compelling. I kept forgetting the second story's characters, and when I was just wanting to read about Taylor, the damn second plot would interrupt.

Apparently I started reading this 22 days ago. That's when I read the first two chapters and thought ""Nope, can't do this"" and shifted it aside to stare at for three weeks. I came back, but with a grumble.It's frustrating and purposely ambiguous for at least 200 pages; the confusing doesn't go away and only lets up enough to give you a few clues. No one ever explains what's going on* and it's set in an unrealistic and unbelievable high school situation (""wars"" for territory of trails, buildings, etc between townies, cadets, and the leader of the six houses of a boarding school which in itself seems unlikely and unrealistic) where no one goes to class. Even by the end, you know you need to reread it all to fully get what happened. So, in other words, a perfect candidate for a Printz, no?*Which yes, I get, is the point since Taylor has no damn clue herself but a little background would have made a difference.I didn't like the bits between chapters, even after I figured out what they were and that I shouldn't have been skimming them. Sometimes in a book, these sorts of breaks are nice but here they caused an ugh! and a flipping to see how many pages I had to get through.BUT - and this is an all caps worthy but - by the end, I really liked it.Here's the thing: I was mad at the book but I wanted to keep reading. I couldn't tell you exactly when, but you'll reach a shift where you stop reading just to plow through and start reading because you don't want to put it down. You've just got to be willing to stick with it long enough to make that happen.The massive mystery unwinds slowly but, and you've got to trust me here, it's worth it. There's a large cast of characters to keep track of, but (again after 200 pages) Taylor, Griggs, Raffaela, and Santangelo pull away and you don't feel so lost. Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that while the reading experience is having lots of pieces thrown at you, Marchetta's a good enough writer to hold it all together. A note on stars / recommendation / ages:Firmly between 4-5 stars, if you keep reading. I'd happily reread the second half, no doubtRecommendations are tough. It's worth recommendations but not for all patron and maybe a ""stick with it"" kind of comment should be included.Also - the Horn Book said 12-14. Roger Sutton, I adore you, but you're crazy. I can't imagine that's where most readers will fall. I'd say 10th on up--not because it's inappropriate for middle school (albeit dark at times in plot and topics) but because it's a text that requires some work and effort to get through. Plus, the main characters (one set, anyway) are for all practical purposes hs seniors.  ",0,oldest,"['ya', 'mystery-suspense', 'z_09']"

It takes a long time to understand what this story is all about. It is worth it by the end, and I am glad I read this. Two families have a head on collision on the highway. Their lives then become tangled and intwined for years and several generations. Life isn't easy for any of them and in the end they realize that they have needed eachother all along. The characters realize they are dependant on one another to survive and care about each other. The kids have been spared from the history and details to try to spare them from the agony of hurt and loss. The kids then have a sense of loss and mystery. They try to find out as much as they can on their own. By banding together in their loss and craziness at the house and camp for wayward boys and girls, who don't have a home, on Jellicoe road, they develop friendships that will last a lifetime. The girls are there year round. The boys only come in for summer camp across the river. The kids have had a tradition of territory wars. This was developed as a way to interact and have fun together. The kids create some close relationships that make me wish I could have experienced all the fun. The kids are recovering from horrible experiences but they come together to create a hope and love. What a beautiful story. VOYA quality is a 5. VOYA popularity 3. I don't think many kids will stick through this book long enough to make it to the good part. The kids in this story were able to give eachother some of the development assets that they need to become a healty adult. Most of the family life missing for the kids was given to them by the relationships they formed with each other. The kids were able to go to a place where solid rules were in place. The camp rules were strict and the territory rules were also very strict and thorough. Many times the older kids were expected to care for the younger ones.

It creates a sort of mystery-feeling that helps move the story along, and there are a couple spots that need the push to get past the angsty-teenager pages. I see that in this book as well as the author's previous books that most of the problems for her teenage protagonists, the thing that sends them over the edge and makes all the adults suddenly worry and pay attention, is that they aren't told all the information. The adults around them, trying to ""protect them,"" hide information. The teenagers want the answers, especially this character who doesn't know who she is or where she came from. And when you're at an age where you're trying to define who you are, not knowing is a big deal.

Taylor ran away from school 3 years ago when she was 14 (with one of the Cadets – Jonah Griggs) to try and find her mother who abandoned her at a 7-11 when she was just a little girl. Taylor’s been wondering about her family and her past for as long as she can remember, and this year things come to a head when her guardian, Hannah, disappears for several weeks to take care of some “personal” business, and leaves Taylor alone and frustrated. Taylor and the leaders of the Cadets and Townies become close friends, as the leaders once were back when the territory wars started. And it’s Jonah, again, who accompanies Taylor when she sets off – this time to track down Hannah – in search of the truth.This is really two stories woven together - Hannah’s story about her past, and Taylor’s story about her present. They’re remarkably similar – with young people who come to be friends and then more than friends, who invent and play a game just so they can spend more time together, and who have a shared history. In Hannah’s story, however, there’s a terrible tragedy that affects the lives of all the others and continues to have effects years later. It’s what makes Taylor’s mom turn to drugs so she can forget, what makes her abandon Taylor, what makes Hannah keep a distance from the people she loves, and what eventually brings the survivors back together again. This is all about the friendships forged and the unraveling mystery of Taylor’s and Hannah’s past. I really like Melina Marchetta’s writing, she creates realistic characters and situations and stories with depth.

There are so many things going on in this book it was hard to keep them straight. There is Taylor Markham, abandoned by her mother when she was 11, her father has never been around and she doesn't know why, her guardian Hannah has left town without telling her, a boy from her past is back in town and getting under her skin. Then there are the territory wars between the townies, the cadets and the students of the Jellico school, a boarding school of which she is their reluctant leader.And then there is the back story which pops up intermitently throughout the book about 5 kids who lived on the Jellicoe Road over 20 years ago, 3 of whom were involved in a terrible accident that killed 5 people. This part confused me at first because I could not figure out how the story of those 5 kids had any relevance at all to the present situation and I kept feeling like I was missing some crucial plot element, but when the pieces start to fall together like pieces in a puzzle it is so worth the wait. Each detail of this story has some relevance and each piece that falls into place is like a revelation. Once things start to come together I had a hard time putting it down and am still thinking about even now.Ultimately this is a book about a girl who is desperate to put together the pieces of her past and find where she belongs. It is a heartbreaking story and yet it is also one of hope and love.There are definitely undertones of some mature subject matter; death, drug addiction, abuse, suicide, and a brief sex scene so I would not recommend it to younger readers or anyone really who would be bothered by that, but definitely a story that made an impression on me.",0,oldest,[]

Failing that, I was certain that after nabbing a National Book Award, What I Saw and How I Lied (2008) would take a Printz award/honor.You can therefore imagine my surprise when it was neither of my predicted titles but Melina Marchetta's Jellicoe Road* (2008**) that won the 2009 Printz Award for excellence in young adult literature. Being a fan of Marchetta's previous novels Looking for Alibrandi (1992) and especially Saving Francesca (2005) you can also imagine my embarrassment upon realizing one of my favorite authors had published a new book without my realizing it.The only solution, of course, was to immediately procure a copy from the library and read it as soon as possible.Jellicoe Road is not a novel with one protagonist. Rather, it has many. The story starts on the Jellicoe Road with a tragic accident that will have far reaching repercussions for each character in the novel. Then, abruptly, the story starts again twenty-two years later at the Jellicoe School--the boarding school located farther down the same road--when Taylor Markham is chosen to lead the school's faction in a secret territory war that has spanned a generation between the school boarders, the Townies, and the Cadets.The Jellicoe School is the only real home Taylor has ever known. She has been at the school since she was eleven, when her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road and Hannah drove by to pick Taylor up and take her to the school. Now seventeen, Taylor is in many ways still a young girl afraid of being abandoned by those she loves. Which is why, at the start of the story, Taylor balks at the authority thrust upon her and the relationships it will necessitate. Leading the Jellicoe School through the territory wars is bad enough, but being in charge of an entire dorm of students seems truly unbearable. Taylor's resolve to live a life apart is tested, and in many ways broken, with the efforts of well-meaning friends and the appearance of Jonah Griggs--the one person Taylor never expected to see, or need, ever again.As the territory wars escalate, Taylor's life is thrown into disarray with the sudden disappearance of Hannah--the only adult Taylor would come close to calling family. With Hannah gone, Taylor begins reading Hannah's unfinished novel for lack of anything else to cling to. Marchetta weaves Taylor's story and the events of Hannah's novel and even the histories of other characters together to create one haunting narrative where, the more Taylor reads, the more it feels like she is looking not at fictitious characters but at people she has known her entire life.While trying to understand Hannah's sudden absence, Taylor also starts to understand herself. Eventually she realizes that living life at a distance offers no protection from abandonment and provides even fewer options to heal scars from past betrayals.The novel starts with rapid fire narration as Taylor throws out events and names at the reader without any frame of reference. Later in the story the importance of the Cadet, the Hermit, and the Brigadier becomes painfully obvious. But in the first pages the narrative comes closer to painfully confusing and unwieldy. By the end of my reading I had a marker at almost every page to indicated important points and favorite passages. However, if you can roll with the uncertainty, you will be rewarded. At a little over four hundred pages, Marchetta still creates a page-turner that moves quickly and weaves together every single narrative thread by the final page.Because Taylor is not forthcoming with explanations, the novel reads like a mystery (fitting since my two Printz Award predictions were also mysteries of sorts). However a good portion of the story is also simply about friendship and love. Taylor expects neither from her time on the Jellicoe Road even though they might be exactly what she was supposed to find there all along. Marchetta blends moments of humor and gravitas in her unique prose style to create another really great read.* Jellicoe Road was actually originally published, I assume in Marchetta's native Australia, with the title On the Jellicoe Road. For various reasons, upon finishing the novel, I feel that this title is superior to the American edition's shortened version.** The book was originally published, again I assume in Australia, in 2006.*** In addition to the original title being superior, in terms of relevance to the story, the original cover art is also much more apt. (Although I just realized the US cover has a Poppy on it which I will grudgingly admit is actually pretty relevant to the story. It also makes it impossible to pick a cover to feature here so, readers, you get both.)",0,oldest,['owned']

And I was never really frustrated with the book, but I was confused. Especially at the beginning. The book starts out very much like a puzzle and I enjoyed putting the pieces together. There were a few things I had issues with : one, Taylor is hinted at being an unreliable narrator a few times, but it didn't really become an issue in the telling of the story - it wasn't a Catcher in the Rye kind of unreliable narrator sort of situation, but there were a few discrepancies between her story and the stories put forth by other characters. Might have just been me getting my panties in a bunch over nothing. The other thing (and this might be a big thing for some readers) is that I put the pieces together too soon. Before the narrator. In some cases many many pages before the narrator. While I do pride myself on being an expert reader, this bugs me. I feel like I shouldn't know something WAY before the main character does. I should maybe think...could that be? nah, there would have been more hints....not Oh I get it now. Wait....she doesn't? Seriously? So yeah. Other than those two points, I really liked this book.

The second half really picked up, and the story started to make a bit of sense and finally at the end, the reward was well worth the wait.If I could rate the book in parts, I'd give the first half about three stars, the next quarter four stars, and the end four and a half to five. I guess that with all the confusion at the beginning, I wasn't AS caught up in the story as I could have been so the payoff at the end wasn't a solid five even though I did really enjoy it.I love stories that weave themselves together, making unrelated strands all have a clear place in the tale by the end. Holes is another really enjoyable example.I'd definitely read more of Melina Marchetta.

Printz Award. Taylor Markham is the main character in this novel filled with mystery, emotion, tragedy, and love. Taylor must solve the puzzle of her past, and make the necessary connections to the present, in order to ensure her future. All the while she is coping with being head of her boarding school dorm, and finds herself representing her school in the territorial war with the Townies and the Cadets. Further complications ensue when she discovers that the Cadets are lead by Jonah Griggs, another part of her past she can’t seem to leave behind. The truth all comes to light on the Jellicoe Road, “the prettiest road I’ve ever seen…”. Developmentally the book delves into teenage peer relationships, the importance of family and one’s past, and the ultimate need for love and to belong (versus abandonment, etc.). The book is full of mystery, adventure, and surprising twists and turns that have definite young adult appeal. The only problem is that the novel is quite confusing in the beginning, going between Taylor in the present and Hannah’s manuscript of the past. I must admit that it is difficult to get into the novel initially, and I’m not sure if young adults will read far enough into the story to get hooked. I would promote the book with other award winners, taking the opportunity to educate teens on the various awards and honors available to young adult literature.",0,oldest,[]

I've said before that outside of romance, I don't need to love/identify with/like my characters. It's really true. I enjoy books where I am completely, utterly separate. I can enjoy author's art without enjoying anything else about the book. And I was detached from this protagonist. She was unlikable. She was detached. And sometimes I even love those characters. But Marchetta's words don't make me care about what's happening, they don't have the clarity and the direction for me to invest in the story. And hold on your hats, unpopular opinion, I don't like her writing.*Ducks/deflects things being thrown*Definitely don't take my word on it, and from what I understand the back half of this book is like...magic. But it's too late friends, I don't care, and I don't think an author should get away with writing such a weird, confusing foundation without it being...the point? If it is the point...I should still care? Does this make sense? Probably not. You might want to check other reviews.

If I could I would of rated it a 0. I just did not enjoy it. I think my main problem was because I never really got into it I would find myself reading solely on short 15 minute breaks at work and that's it. This is a book that you need to read in large chunks in a short amount of time so that the story doesn't lose you.Be warned that this book starts off confusing. There are a couple stories that the author is having you read and for the fist 150-200 pages or so you will have no clue how they relate. She does tie them together and it ends up making sense in the end.Some surprising bad language makes its way into the end of the book and I just didn't feel like it was needed. Especially since nothing was used earlier. There is also a ""love"" scene at the end of the book that I felt was not needed either.If you really feel the pull to read this book do not buy it.

I wasn't expecting that and frankly I kind of hate books that are based in Australia. Like, Stolen. I don't know why it bothered me but it did and I did not enjoy it. Plus, I'm kinda over the whole boarding school thing. After reading The Disreputable History of Frankie... and The Mockingbirds , I became kind of disenchanted with the whole thing. Which is sad because some books like Looking for Alaska do it pretty well. The dozen pages or so that I actually read of this book kinda sucked if I'm to be honest. I didn't understand what they were talking about. It seemed, at first, that they girl's mother died on this notorious ""Jellicoe Road"" but then she talks about her like she's alive or something and I didn't understand. And then she was elected to be some kind of leader for some darn secret society and I started gagging because it reminded me of the darn books I mentioned above(the Frankie and mockingbirds one). I just didn't like it and when I read those dozen pages or whatever and sat it down, I knew that I wouldn't be picking it up again.

Maybe it's the fact that from the start the book is extremely confusing and it takes over 100 pages just to get to some kind of connection between the characters. I just could not get into this book. I didn't care for the characters and if you have to read 100 pages just to make sense in a book I say it's not worth it. Perhaps the fact that I kept putting it down and reading other books instead should have given me the clue that it was not my taste.

When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they’re some kind of garbage, don’t you know? ‘Wonder dies.’""""According to Dickens, the first rule of human nature is self-preservation and when I forgive him for writing a character as pathetic as Oliver Twist, I'll thank him for the advice.""""I remember love. It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not he pain they're getting over, it's the love.""I thought this was a very confusing book. It just sort of plops you down right in the middle of things that don't get explained until the middle of the book. (and I'm not talking about the secrets. I am talking about details that make the basic plot.) I also thought that some of the author's sentences were poorly developed which left the reader wondering who the sentence was even about. I did love how parts of a manuscript one of the characters was intertwined throughout the book. I wasn't left wanting more from this book. It ended when it did and I didn't miss the experience of reading it and I will not read this book again.",0,oldest,[]

I had high expectations based on the rave reviews and the blurb. It's a good concept for a good story but for me this is just written RAW. It starts out really confusing, and I mean in a bad way and not the type of confusion that engages the reader. The worst part is it continues that way until more than half of the book. For a place that is supposed to be so wonderful, so beautiful, and so central to the lives of these kids, Jellicoe is sadly just not described well enough to make you actually believe. I was also not totally convinced and could not empathize properly with the characters in the story. I forgive the unbelievable amount of tragedies and coincidences, and there were some good pages in it when Marchetta rewards your patience and confusion with some fluid chapters, but I, seriously, did not like this.",0,oldest,[]

Honestly, if you can't make the plot interesting enough to hook people by then, you just need to stop writing.I never felt any connection with the characters--no one really had any special personality that made me really like them or even really dislike them--they were just there, with me feeling completely neutral about them.The plot was practically non-existent and what little there was could be figured out halfway through the book.The territory war was honestly the most pointless thing I have ever read about. Definitely the only reason it was added was so Taylor could fall in love with one of her enemies.Speaking of falling in love, I did not feel any kind of love between Taylor and Jonah. Maybe there was just too much else going on in the book, but in any case, if it's a big enough plot point to put on the summary on the back cover, it's a big enough plot point to actually make seem realistic.I regret buying this book.

I listened to this book on audio, so I would like to think that it might have made more sense if I had read it, but probably not.Like many other reviewers, I found the first third of the book to be extremely confusing. There are ""border wars"" between the kids from the Jellicoe school, the townies, and the cadets. For the longest time I couldn't decipher if these wars were serious and spoke to the setting, or if they were just child's play. When it became evident that the adults in the story didn't know about the border wars, I stopped caring because the border wars were obviously just some added element that didn't really serve a purpose or move the plot forward. Next was the ""manuscript"" that the chapters alternate back and forth between. This did not translate well into the audio book at all and for the record, THERE WERE TOO MANY DAMN CHARACTERS. I couldn't keep track of all the kids in the manuscript and all the kids in present tense. It seemed to me that the manuscript gave Taylor (MC) an omniscient advantage, but then at the same time, how could she not realize that the kids from the manuscript were related to her, especially when she seemed to know so much about them. Learning about these characters via their pasts just didn't work well--there was too much of a disconnect.And the hermit. Once we find out who he is, there's still no explanation as to why he shot himself (with a shotgun--is that possible?) right in front of Taylor. Again, this element was just a sensational idea that served no purpose.I think the take away from this book is that connections are important, family or otherwise, but the message was overshadowed with so many other frivolous happenings and dead end ideas. I did not enjoy this book at all and couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm sure there were many other more deserving novels for the Printz award that year.",0,oldest,"['audio-book', 'award-winner', 'young-adult', 'mystery', 'contemporary-lit', 'coming-of-age', 'books-for-guys']"

Entonces...¿Qué sentido tiene que todos contaran que su final era increíble si la primera mitad, que son unas 200 páginas, no te enteras ni de quién es la protagonista, quienes son los demás personajes y dónde se encuentran?.Se me hacía tan tedioso leer un libro que no comprendía nada de lo que estaba pasando...Pienso que está mal escrito y que eso hace que no me enterase de nada, además hay millones de personajes y al cuando aparece el nombre de uno, me quedaba tipo ""¿y este quién era?"".También, la historia de amor pasó de ser de un te odio a un te quiero en un día... Osea nada creíble.Y el final, pues tampoco fue para tanto si el libro no lo estaba entendiendo. Si hubiera estado mejor escrito y me hubiera ubicado mejor en la historia, ese final hubiese estado mejor y me hubiera encantado el libro.Además, no podría hablar de la trama con un hilo argumental y decir ""primero pasa esto, luego lo otro y por último aquello"" ¡Es imposible! Es todo demasiado confuso.Lo único bueno, fueron las frases bonitas y que el final de algún capítulo me dejaba impactada. Pero sin más. Me hubiera impresionado muchísimo más si estuviera mejor narrado.",0,newest,[]

Hasta las 100 primeras páginas, todo es muy confuso. Hay muchísimos interrogantes y hechos que no sabes por qué están sucediendo. La verdad que todo me parecía caótico y desordenado, e incluso me aburría avanzar en la historia porque sentía que no iba a ningún sitio. Sin embargo, a partir de la mitad del libro conseguí engancharme bastante gracias a que hay más acción y se desarrolla el arco romántico. Aunque «En el camino de Jellicoe» parece contener muchas tramas por donde tirar: guerras territoriales, una desaparición, hechos que ocurrieron en el pasado, etc. La verdad es que finalmente la acción se centra casi por completo en nuestra protagonista Taylor y su pasado.Las guerras territoriales, que se van anunciado a lo bombo y platillo por todo el libro, brillan su ausencia (y lógica). Sinceramente, da la impresión que nadie tiene un motivo serio para nada. Los personajes atacan los otros bandos porque sí y se perdonan con una celeridad pasmante🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️.En cuanto los hechos del pasado, vale la pena mencionar que son complejos y tristes, además de contarnos sobre nuevas esperanzas y otras rotas♥. Sin duda, esta línea argumental es la que más interesante me ha parecido de toda la novela y descubrir cómo se conectaría con la historia del presente.Sobre los personajes, reconozco que no he acabado de conectar con Taylor, nuestra protagonista. Al inicio de la novela me pareció que tenía potencial, pero varias cosas de ella las encontré demasiado inmaduras y, en general, me pareció un personaje plano. Por el contrario, me he dado cuenta de que el resto de personajes de En el camino de Jellicoe sí que me gustado bastante. «En el camino de Jellicoe» es una novela que descubre pasados rotos y complejos, pero con una protagonista que, en mi opinión, no consigue estar a la altura. Además, aunque a partir de la mitad del libro disfruté la historia, el final se me quedó algo flojo.",0,newest,[]

Me sentí muy perdida durante demasiado tiempo con muchas piezas sueltas pendientes de encajar. Hay mucha intriga y eso es un aspecto guay de esta lectura.Luego todo empieza a encajar. Todo. Y es como que empieza a molar porque por fin vas entendiendo todo. Pero a pesar de esto y a pesar de que la última parte gana muchos puntos, no conseguí conectar con la historia. Ya digo, no me caló. Y creo que es por haberme tenido perdida durante demasiadas páginas para mi gusto, y por la protagonista... Esa protagonista es que no. No. Hubiera agradecido un poco más de guía al lector, algun dato en ciertas partes del texto... y una prota con más carisma.Pero oye, la historia, original, es. Yo sé que este libro ha gustado a mucha gente así que si teníais pensado leerlo seguid con la idea.

First of all: The beginning. I mean, like, the first 150 pages. What even was that? I didn't understand a single thing that was going on and I couldn't keep up with any of the characters. The first time I picked this up I spent about a week getting to page 156 and then couldn't drag myself through it any longer. This time I went in hard and powered through the entire book in two days (even though I very much didn't understand why the entire first half). It does get noticeably better in the second half. But not as much as I hoped. Second of all: The characters weren't that well developed. At least I didn't feel I got to know Raffy or Jessa or what-was-that-person's-name? at all. Third of all: Unnecessary relationship between plain YA-protagonist and boring love interest. Don't come for me please.Forth of all: I still don't completely understand how Taylor figured everything out. (view spoiler)[Like how did she know Hannah was Narnie, and how did she find out that Fitz shot Webb? (hide spoiler)] This was probably explained and I just didn't read closely enough. So yeah. Great that y'all loved it but this was not for me.",2,newest,[]

I don't necessarily mind this in a book — sometimes it's fun to try to piece things together — but it's a solid third of the way through the book before you have any kind of clue WTF is going on. That was far too long for me and kept me from feeling connected to the main character because I couldn't understand her motives for a lot of what she did, much of which was being terrible to other people.-Once the pieces did start falling into place, I found it to be disappointingly predictable. I figured out who the Brigadier was chapters before Taylor did. If it was supposed to be a mystery, it didn't play out like one — it was more like everything was a confusing jumble, so I didn't even know what I was looking at, and then suddenly it all came into focus and I was just waiting for Taylor to catch up.-The writing felt much more like telling than showing. It was very choppy, a lot of ""This happened and then this happened and then this person said this."" This meant that the romance felt underdeveloped and I had no real reason to root for them to get together or stay together, and the fact that they were either jumping each other or screaming at each other felt disconnected to any actual passion.-Also, Jonah is kind of a terrible person at the opening of the book, and he never really redeems himself. It's more like a combination of Taylor remembering him at his most vulnerable + he behaves like a halfway-decent person for a while. The characters are constantly throwing one-liners at each other, so we don't see who they are as individuals. At one point we're told something like, ""Jonah said some witty things to the girls,"" which just felt like lazy writing to me — tell us what the witty things were, and maybe we'll get some sense of his personality?-The underdeveloped writing also extended to plotting. One example: Taylor's bike gets stolen. Then there's a chapter where she's riding her bike into enemy territory. Then later her bike turns up again. We get no explanation — Was this a flashback? Did she borrow someone else's bike? No idea. Another example: The kids all get in the car together and they're driving and driving and Taylor is settling into the back seat and watching the colors go by the window, until she sees something and makes them all stop. When they get back in the car, the driver says, ""Where should we go?"" and they have a whole discussion about it and then start driving again. There's no reason that conversation couldn't have happened before they started driving initially, and it's unclear where exactly they were planning to drive to in the first place before they screeched to a halt and then had a conversation about it. This contributed to the feeling of being lost while reading, and it didn't feel intentional, just sloppy.-I am not a fan of magical realism, so all the pieces with the boy in the tree in Taylor's dream and how she named herself before she was born were a little eye-roll-y to me.I actually really liked the idea behind the book and I think I would have genuinely liked the book a lot had it been executed better. There's a sweet message about found family and laying aside differences and how we can come to terms with the past and move forward. And the interweaving of Hannah's book, as Taylor's reading it out of order, was a clever device. It was just unfortunate that we're told at the very beginning that Taylor's story opens ""twenty-two years later"" than the start of Hannah's story, because otherwise we, like Taylor, might think it was fictional until the coincidences with real life start happening.So, on the whole, I didn't hate the book, and I can understand why people like it (I was even tearing up a little bit at the end), but in general it was hard to get through and not enjoyable for me personally.",0,newest,[]

I must have really missed something here. I found it boring, convoluted and neither relatable or believable. I thought it was quite an unrealistic portrayal of trauma and it did nothing for me emotionally. For example, her mother is a “drug addict” who abandoned her daughter. There’s no nuance- I gather we’re supposed to believe all drug addicts are the same so there’s no need to go into any detail of her mother’s addiction or personality, because “Addict due to past trauma” is her whole identity. All the interesting emotions were brushed over in a shallow way and there was little depth or complexity. ",0,newest,[]

I love many things about this book but am overwhelmed by discomfort. Anger even. One of the important failings is the head space of a child without parents. It wasn’t realistic to me. I know this is a hugely unpopular view and the majority of readers love this book but I found the soppiness upsetting. Unrealistic. Dismissive of the true experiences of voiceless children. It was a book about some kids without parents that is opaque and unrealistic in its approach and I feel that it’s unfair and let’s down and is a disservice to the true to life experiences of such kids - books are written about this world so rarely. What a missed opportunity! At least show SOME aspects of reality. We were allowed to feel sorry for rejected characters (druggies on the street) but no real engagement was achieved. Instead the message was to reject and give up on them. The lucky and loved remained the entitled. So... In the end I found this book offensive. I know it’s safe and easily consumable but it’s not real. It’s fiction to the true sense and probably easier for conservative readers. A safer read than reality might serve up. ,0,newest,[]

The book goes on and on for ages with nothing in particular happening. It has two storylines running side by side. That of Taylor Markham who is abandoned by her mother Tate at a 7/11 after Tate phoned her paternal aunt, Hannah to pick her up. And another one running about 22 years earlier which through the course of the book we realise is about Hannah and Taylor’s parents and their friends. I had a problem with this book on the issue of the territory wars. I found it hard to imagine these “wars” and even harder to imagine any teenagers to refer to an ages old notebook containing the regulations on which these wars were said to be waged without wanting to make any amendments themselves. In the end the wars were practically inconsequential to the storyline anyway so the author could have left them out. Ridiculous also is how Hannah never tells Taylor that she is her aunt and her father’s sister, and also that she always kept Taylor at arm’s length. The pathetic explanation that Tate told her not to mother her because she already had a mother really ruins it. I mean what would you do, respect the wishes of a junkie who can’t even respect her own child or show some love to a poor abandoned eleven-year-old? Actually it seems that whilst Taylor longed to find out about her past, all the adults around seemed to conspire to keep her in the dark.",0,newest,[]

But the thing is, is that it starts with a flashback, and then starts again with different characters in the middle of gearing up for the annual territory wars at their school. I'm pretty much the least competitive person I know, so things like war games don't really hook me the way they would other readers. But I trust the Printz committee, so I stuck with it, and I did end up wanting to know what would happen. Although I saw how things fit together before they were revealed, and that made it a little less fun for me. I liked that the book had a bunch of emotionally damaged characters but they weren't melodramatically emotionally damaged (the manuscript flashbacks were written too dramatically, but I think that's a separate issue).",0,oldest,"['boarding-school', 'yyay']"

The only reason I read the novel was because it is part of a workshop I'm taking this summer.Two story lines are going on at the same time. You know they must be connected in some way, but you have to get to the end of the book to truly know how they are connected.The characters are believable and likeable, and the setting is in the bush of Australia. A pretend ""war"" is going on between the students of Jellicoe School, the Cadets, and the ""Townies"". However, the real story revolves around Taylor, who is the student in charge of the Jellicoe School side of the ""war"" and her coming to terms with the loss of her mother, the loss of her very good friend Hannah, and her feelings for the leader of the Cadets, Jonah Griggs, with whom she has a slight past.I believe the story is told in such a confusing way because Taylor's emotions are so confused and heated.

I was confused when I got back to it which seldom happens with young adult literature.Two very similar sets of characters in two different time periods add to the mix yet they are not distinct enough to stand on their own.I really liked the way the book ended but getting to the good part was a challenge.

I felt like I started reading in the middle of a book instead of page 1. When I actually got to the middle of the book, I really enjoyed it and was interested in the characters. By the end, it all just kind of fizzled and I ended up disappointed. I figured out the 'twist' very early on and the ending just seemed too neat and clean for how messy and confusing the rest of the book was. Very interesting, good idea - it just wasn't carried out very well. Advisory: occasional strong language throughout",0,oldest,[]

As I was reading it, I couldn't figure out why. I finished it last night and slept on it. When I woke up this morning, I realized what the problem was. I simply did not like some of the ""younger generation"" main characters ... especially Taylor and Griggs. Both of them seemed very fake and contrived. I especially didn't like Taylor's voice, and she's the narrator! (This books is told in first person from her view.) So, no matter what was going on, I couldn't get away from Taylor. Blech.Except! There are these passages in italics, which you'll soon find out, are in fact excerpts from Hannah's book that she has been writing. Ahh, there I could get some escape from Taylor! I enjoyed Hannah's narration and storytelling. If the entire story had been told in Hannah's voice, with her style of narration, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more. Hannah's passages had sort of a mystical quality to them, and the characters in her book were much more likable than the characters in the ""real life"" world of Taylor and Griggs.Blech! I'm glad the book is over. Taylor became more tolerable toward the end ... but for the first 80% of the book, she was just so terribly annoying. As I would read this book, it was a real effort for me to turn the page. I had no interest in the main characters, in fact I didn't even like them, so ... there were times when I'd ask myself, ""Why am I turning the page?"" And then I would say, ""Ah yes. It's for the book club. OK, I'll keep reading."" It was just that pointless. I'm glad I finished, only because that means it's all behind me now. I could give it 1 star, but somehow 2 stars for ""it was okay"" feels better. I did kind of like the story of the older generation.",0,oldest,[]

There were quite a few things I liked about it, but the overall story was slow for me, and I coudn't really get into it. However, that is just my opinion, so I am not making any recommendations on this book, positive or negative. I will only list a few personal pros and cons:Pros:- the way that the story of the past and present blend together as the story progresses- the depth of the characters, particulary Jonah Griggs and Taylor Markham. The author alerts you to elements of their past without flat out saying it - letting the reader use more inferencing, which I like.Cons:- the first 100 pages of the book are super confusing, and I almost put the book down. I don't usually give up on books, especially after an investment of 100 pages, but I was that confused at first.- the story didn't hold my interest for a lot of the book, and I felt that I was finishing it just to finish it. The last 100 pages were the best, to me.",0,oldest,[]

I loved the novel finding it unputdownable, mainly because of the relatable characters. I think Jonah, Santangelo, Raffie and the 'killer' were all great, I didn't really conect with the main character but thisdidnt stop it from being a great read!!

I've been putting this off all day long. I'm not sure why this missed the mark for me when so many others adored it, and I do adore her style, but this just...didn't work. I spent a lot of time being confused and trying to keep the 5 separate in my mind and who was who, and who did what, and why it should matter so much, but it was tiresome. I thought that it was choppy and I wasn't satisfied with the information I was given about anyone. I spent the majority of the book just seeing the words on the page, but there were a couple times I did tear up. I just wanted more of the way she wrote Finnikin of the Rock and Froi of the Exiles so that I could be so immersed in the story that I forgot everything else. I don't know what to say about this really. I'm too tired to put any real effort into it, and since there are nothing but glowing reviews I'm sure it was just me. I plan on reading it again sometime to see if it makes better sense, and maybe I'll be able to connect much stronger to Taylor and Jonah than I did this time around. ",3,oldest,[]

What will be left of me then?”“¿Para qué querría que alguien fuera mi “todo” si un día tal vez ya no estará a mi lado? ¿Qué quedaría de mi entonces?”Me tiré a la piscina con esta lectura porque era el primer libro elegido por el grupo creado por @natinbooks para el reto #unlibroeninglesalmes que organiza este año. No tenía ni idea de qué iba la historia y lo cierto es que me pasé las primeras casi 100 páginas más perdida que un pulpo en un garaje, porque la narración alterna dos líneas temporales (el presente y el pasado en forma de un relato inconexo y desordenado que ha escrito una de los personajes) y cuesta un montón entender lo que pasó/está pasando.Básicamente tenemos un cóctel conformado por un grupo de adolescentes y niños que viven en una especie de internado, los chicos del pueblo cercano y un grupo de “cadetes juveniles” que pasan el verano en un campamento “¿pseudomilitar?” en los terrenos anexos al internado. Hay un juego como de bandas, en el que pelean entre ellos por el territorio. Desaparece una persona. Reaparecen viejos conocidos de los protagonistas… en fin, una historia de adolescentes extraña.Me obligué a proseguir con la lectura y acabarlo y la verdad es que al final va mejorando un poco, porque empiezas a entender cosas, la narración se ordena, se hace más ligera y los protagonistas interactúan más entre ellos. Y conseguí engancharme en las últimas 100 páginas, en las que me eché unas risas y la historia se hizo más interesante, aunque muy previsible.¿Lo recomendaría? Mmmmm, creo que no, salvo que no tengáis nada más que leer alrededor o que necesitéis una lectura ligera de las de no pensar.",0,newest,"['read-2021', 'in-english']"

Me ha dejado muy reflexiva. Empezaré diciendo que desde el principio he ido con unas expectativas altísimas y eso ha sido un problema. Me ha costado entender la historia, ya que es muy dispersa. Me he liado mucho con los personajes, no sabía si los nombres eran de chicos o de chicas, quien era el narrador... en fin, me he hecho un lío hasta más o menos las últimas 100 páginas, que ha sido cuando he empezado a entender cosas relevantes de la trama y me ha empezado a interesar. Hay escenas realmente fuertes, emocionantes, sentimentales y que me han conmovido, pero en general, me he quedado con un sabor de boca algo insípido. Es como si me hubieran faltado cosas por entender. Necesito más tiempo para digerirlo todo o una relectura en un futuro próximo. En resumen: gran parte del libro ha sido un poco meh pero la parte final me ha gustado y engamchado muchísimo. 3/5⭐",2,newest,[]

There were parts of this book I found just wonderful -- in particular, Melina Marchetta does teenagers shooting the breeze and falling in love, the multiple layers of that dialogue and how it can be both understatedly casual and completely overwhelmingly meaningful and intense at the same time, better than anyone I know. I loved Taylor's relationship with Griggs, I loved the territory wars (once I figured out they were just a game and not some postapocalyptic serious thing), all the school stuff was great. But the family piece felt willfully obscure to me, and also sort of willfully irrational or melodramatic. Like, WHY wouldn't Hannah tell Taylor she was her aunt? She could do that without undermining her relationship with her mother, it seemed to me -- indeed, it might even clarify the Hannah-Taylor relationship by better defining the roles. Or why wouldn't she tell Taylor about her dad, her beloved brother? Did Taylor not know her mom's first name was Tate? The Hermit was Fitz, and he shot himself because he felt guilty about shooting Webb, right? And he did it in front of Taylor because she reminded him so much of Webb?Everyone says this is better the second time through, and I can believe that, and I guess I should go back and reread it. But the first read left me so nonplussed about all this that I don't really want to spend the eye time on the second read. It was okay, but I didn't love it.",2,oldest,['ya-fiction']

In the end I really did love the story, though it was very sad and tragic in parts. The reason this book wasn't a 4 or 5 star book for me was in the way the plot is set up. At the beginning I found it very confusing. A story told in italics, a bitchy, hateful teenager, and a weird Skulls-esque secret society who are fighting a turf war with no purpose. It took a while for the plot to sort itself out and to get me to care about all the characters, though I did by the end. I also thought there was too much foreshadowing, so by the time Taylor makes her revelations, it's not shocking, it's something that I've figured out chapters before. At the beginning it seemed like that was the point: that Taylor really know the truth but doesn't want to say it aloud, and won't admit she knows until it's completely obvious. I'm not sure if that's what the author intended though.I didn't like the climax. It seemed over the top like the author wanted a big gesture to get her point across, but it made me skeptical (like of course that would happen) especially when the real cause came out. Disappointing, but once all that was over I loved the actual ending. So by the end it all came together and made sense. However, it took too long to get there, and I can understand people giving up on the book before they finish. Definitely don't think it should have won the Printz (I think Hunger Games was better) but it did deal with some tough issues really well. I would still definitely recommend it, but a little editing would have made it better.",0,oldest,"['2009', 'ya']"

This book is more like a Rauschenberg painting - at first there is a sense of chaos, of story lines that you know MUST be related (they are in the same book after all) but its not tidy, like a tapestry where the picture starts to become clearer as its woven. The longer you look at a Rauschenberg painting, though, the more you can see pattern and even a cohesive theme. There are themes of abandonment, mixed with love and hope, of learning about the frailties of one's parents (who are human and have a past that does not include you), of discovering a history you belong to.

At seventeen she attends the Jellicoe School, where 10% of the students are also wards of the state, like her. It's convenient for Taylor, whose caretaker, Hannah, lives right outside school property. At the beginning of her senior year, she finds herself elected not only leader of her dorm, but leader of all the Jellicoe dorms in the Territory Wars in which her school, the Townies and the Cadets (who camp in the local bushland every year) participate. The rules have been passed down year after year in a purple notebook, and Taylor is under pressure to make sure things go smoothly for Jellicoe. However, just as things are getting underway, Hannah leaves without notice, and Taylor's life is in turmoil. She discovers that the manuscript of Hannah's that she's been reading over the years might be more than just a story, and she discovers that the Cadet she claims to have no history with might be more than just a one-time acquaintance. As the leaders of the various groups get closer through the War, they find that there is more to their game than they ever thought, and Taylor discovers that her family history is more complicated and bittersweet than she'd ever imagined.Marchetta's book is beautiful, but stricken with slow pacing that may not catch the attention of many readers. While the snippets of Hannah's manuscript and the peeks at romance certainly make things interesting, the plot doesn't pick up until at least half way through the book, and the Territory Wars are confusing at best until the very end. This is a book that I would certainly recommend to teen readers, but not without the caveat that they really need to stick with it to get to the good parts.",0,oldest,[]

So, of course, I had to read it to see what the fuss was about. I know from reading other librarians' blogs that this winner came out of left field. And I have to agree with them. To me, this title is a lot like The Book Thief. It's a mature book, but not because it's full of ""adult"" topics. It's written like an adult book--flashbacks, lots of secondary characters, and winding plots and innuendos.[return][return]I had to force myself to finish it. I didn't get sucked into the book until the last third of it, when I had to stay up until 1 am to finish. However, I don't think my teenagers will enjoy it. It's another boarding school book and the mystery doesn't grab the reader like it should. The italicized flashbacks are confusing until the readers gets to the last third of the book. I never really liked the main character, either, although she does seem witty. I didn't want to feel sorry for her because she isn't nice to her housemates. And when she finally was a good friend, I thought her actions seemed forced.",0,oldest,['young-adult']

The beginning was confusing and not very interesting. But, I read the reviews on Goodreads - plus, it won the Printz award, so I felt sort of obliged to read it - and many of them said the same thing: keep reading, the end is worth it. And it is. The problem is, I don't think many teens are willing to wade through 100+ pages of a book before the story starts to make sense or gets really interesting. Like many other award winners, this story has orphans (why are there always orphans?), and similar to some other Printz award and honor books(Frankie Landau-Banks, Looking for Alaska), this story takes place at a boarding school (I wonder how many teens can relate to living at a boarding school?). At any rate, if you've got a teen who is a very mature and patient reader, you might recommend this to them. There are two sex scenes (very mild, not graphic), and a good amount of cursing, so you might want to consider that when making recommendations. For high school and up. ",0,oldest,[]

Abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road when she was eleven, Taylor Markham, now seventeen, is finally being confronted with her past. But as the reluctant leader of her boarding school dorm, there isn't a lot of time for introspection. And while Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family, has disappeared, Jonah Griggs is back in town, moody stares and all. In this absorbing story by Melina Marchetta, nothing is as it seems and every clue leads to more questions as Taylor tries to work out the connection between her mother dumping her, Hannah finding her then and her sudden departure now, a mysterious stranger who once whispered something in her ear, a boy in her dreams, five kids who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen years ago, and the maddening and magnetic Jonah Griggs, who knows her better than she thinks he does. If Taylor can put together the pieces of her past, she might just be able to change her future. Some students might enjoy the book as it deals with initiations and cliques.

Yeah, it was dull and depressing, but compared to the other stuff they make me read it was a breath of fresh, tropical air. The characters are interesting, if a little too mysterious and obnoxious for my liking. The plot was well structured and I liked how the story came full circle. It had the odd effect of being encouraging despite all the death and sadness. I suppose I would recommend it. ",0,oldest,['schoolbooks']

And it's hard for me to know that, and know that it's a Printz winner, and not give it 5 stars myself. But I just couldn't connect with this book. I actually gave up on it, and only picked it up again at the urging of a few friends. The writing is absolutely amazing. I would definitely pick up something else by the author because her writing is wonderful. But the long slog to get to the plot in the beginning, and then the ultimate pay-off, was just too confusing and not worth it. I thought many of the plot points didn't seem to match character motivations, and I wasn't sure why characters were acting that way. I also guessed a few of the issues that were supposed to be surprises. That being said, a lot of the story was compelling and drew me in. I liked how the relationship between the two main characters played out, and I thought Taylor's growth was wonderful. Ultimately, though, I didn't LOVE the book. ",0,oldest,[]

La verdad es que el principio me costó mucho, entre que el inglés me pareció un poco complicado y que la historia no me tenía mucho sentido yo estaba perdida.Pero una vez fui avanzando en la historia me vi de lleno en ella, intentando entenderlo todo y sin estar preparada para cada giro de los acontecimientos.Lo mejor: los personajes, sin ninguna duda. Son personas con un trasfondo tan profundo que se merecen toda tu atención. Mi favorito es Griggs, por supuesto, es mi tipo de chico. Me alegro muchísimo de haberme animado a leer este libro, va a ser de esos que recordare siempre",0,newest,[]

Una historia muy adolescente, llena de energía y belleza. Misteriosa, dolorosa, pero con un final positivo y realista.Me divertí mucho con sus aventuras en medio de la naturaleza, disfruté mucho su amistad, entendí sus miedos y me involucré con ellos. Discutimos, hicimos muchas cosas. Un par de escenas que pasar rápido, pero estuvo bien. Mi personaje favorito será Raffy, tiene todo lo que quiero.Le gustó al hijo de psiquiatra porque las personalidades están de acuerdo a las vivencias, familias y problemas de los personajes. Me gustó a mí, porque todos, juntos, con mucho cariño y paciencia, sanaron. Formaron una familia, se perdonaron, ¡grandioso!",0,newest,['emoción']

Sin embargo, creo que a día de hoy, alguien que lee mucho juvenil, no le maravillaría leer este libro. Y esa soy yo.Me habría encantado saber antes de empezarlo que tendría que tener paciencia, que no me engancharía a la primera y que solo disfrutara de la pluma de la autora. Me habría encantado que nadie me dijera que terminaría con el corazón adolorido para así no esperarlo. Esta novela se centra más en el misterio que envuelve la vida de Taylor, nuestra protagonista, además de encontrar un romance en enemies to lovers y slow burn.No ha sido sino hasta la página 150 cuando por fin me enganché a la historia y a encariñarme con los personajes. Dejarlos ha sido de hecho un pequeño vacío. Creo que este libro es de esos qué hay que leer una y otra vez en tu vida para regresar a ese sentimiento de nostalgia y volver a fijarte en aquellos detalles que te perdiste. La pluma de la autora me ha gustado mucho: no ha sido repetitiva, ha sido dulce y a la vez feroz, queriendo que aquellas frases importantes realmente lleguen a tocarte el corazón. Por supuesto que lo recomiendo, pero solo a quien quiere leer algo un poco pesado al inicio, alguien que busca no una lectura fácil ni rápida, sino que solo quiere adentrarse a una historia nostálgica.",12,newest,['4-stars']

The Plot:I'm . . . um . . . not even going to bother. It's too complicated, involving flashbacks, repressed memories, secret journals, a bizarre turf war between private school, military school, and townie kids, a thick coating of slang, and a double-barreled storyline. Marchetta doesn't bother giving a lot of context to what is going on, trusting her readers to have the patience to figure it out themselves. Thus, the first half of the book is darn confusing.However, the SECOND half of the book is impossible to put down. While I feel that the plot relied heavily on coincidences, the characters' ideas and actions so perfectly depicted adolesence -- where a childhood game could concievably be heightened into a overdramatic imitation of adult life, where anything is a good excuse for DRAMA -- that I can understand why the Printz committee chose to give it the big gold sticker this year.",0,oldest,[]

I generally try not to give away spoilers, but I'm going to clue you in on part of a spoiler here, because otherwise the first part of the book would be nearly impossible to follow. There are large sections of italics in the first half of the book. This is another story, written by another character in the book (not saying who, although the reader will figure it out quickly). The first half is a bit disjointed at times, which makes sense because the main character, Taylor Markham, isn't sure where she fits in. She finds herself the reluctant leader of a private school dorm, thrust into planning the annual schemes the school puts up against the Cadets and Townies. Taylor's life is shaken further when Hannah, an adult counselor of sorts who lives on the school grounds, vanishes overnight. Taylor's mother abandoned her near the school when she was 11, and the teen always saw Hannah as a mother figure. She is especially worried because of additional reports of young girls going missing. In addition, it seems like Taylor's closest peers and adults know more about her past than she does -- are are reluctant to give her any details. As I said -- the first half of the book is a bit disjointed, but it's not too bad. Things finally get rolling with the confrontations between the teens at the school, the Townies and the Cadets, and the story finds its stride when the students go on vacation. At that point is when the book becomes purely exhilerating, and the wrap-ups end on many unexpected twists. Some language, but fairly clean overall; good for 8th/9th grade and up.",0,oldest,"['fiction', 'young-adult']"

At first I was more interested in the side story, which appears in italics, than the main story of Taylor. However, once more of Taylor’s past is revealed and Jonah appears, I was hooked. As more of Taylor is revealed, you begin to understand why so many people try to protect her, even when she is not being nice in return. You cannot help but want to protect her. She just wants to have a mother, to have someone who will love her and not leave her in the middle of nowhere and never look back. As the side story and Taylor’s begin to interconnect, you understand why Taylor was left with Hannah.Teens can relate to Taylor and her school life. So many times high school can feel like a war between the different caste systems. At Taylor’s school, it actually is war. Her need to find Hannah, her reliance on Jonah, who should be her enemy in this war, and her friends are all relatable. In addition, the side story, of how a tragic event can break apart a group of friends and wreak havoc on their future, can also appeal to teens. Friends share so much at this age that most teens are bound to have dealt with situations that solidified friendships for years to come. While Taylor seems one-dimensional at first, she grows into a solid, three-dimensional character by the end. I would have to talk about this book to promote it. Just looking at the cover or reading the jacket flap is not enough to know this book is worth reading. I would tease the two connecting stories and give a hint of Taylor’s emotional conflicts that relate directly to the side story.4Q, 4P, J/S",0,oldest,"['kent-ya-class', 'printz-award']"

The story is unusual and complicated, and the two narratives are confusing for a very long time -- distractingly so. In fact, I suspect it will lose a lot of its targeted teen audience because it's ""hard"".The italicized narrative is, in my opinion, the weak part of the book, and I wish that part of the story had been told in a different way. There are several things about it that bothered me. For instance, the writing is grandiose and overly dramatic to the point of being kind of ridiculous and annoying (Did she really count 132 minutes? Was that before or after Tate crawled over and held their hands? Did they all sit in the same spot for 2 hours and 12 minutes, counting the time? Before Fitz arrived? And then the cars blew up? After 132 + 10 or so minutes? Or was the dad still alive when Fitz dragged him out? Hmmm... ) Also, there is too much omniscient narration for a story told from one person's point of view. Definitely the weak part of the story.However, the part of the book that deals with the day to day life of Taylor and her friends is fascinating and entertaining. I would have enjoyed more tales of the war between the different factions. The Australian setting is neat but negligible -- the story could have taken place in any remote place in any country. I also didn't think it was necessary to tie up every single loose end. Who cares who the serial killer is? Why state what happened to Webb when it's already heavily implied? Why make neat a story that is all about complicated messes?Overall, an enjoyable, fresh read. I think adults who enjoy reading young adult fiction will like this more than teens.",0,oldest,['ya']

On the surface, there's a lot happening with the regional wars between different factions of a boarding school, and on another layer there's what's happening with a mysterious serial killer and a missing guardian, and on yet another level there's the supposedly fictional narrative that becomes more and more real as the story goes along.

Poor Ricky just hung out with the kids in the water while boring Mom read her books. After about page 50 I couldn't put this one down. Did not expect it to turn out the way it did. From the beginning I thought it was going to be a fun loving, camp warfare, pranks and lighthearted comedic young adult. It definitely took a turn away from that. I ended up being a beautiful book about family, friendship, redemption, how the past influences the future, and fears. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the story of the Fab Five, and Taylor's search for herself. There were brave moments, funny moments, romantic moments, and sad moments. All in all, a great book.

TOO MANY chapters begin essentially the same way!That said, I liked the narrator. Not sure exactly why I liked this one so much, as there were a lot of things I thought inadequately reasoned (like why Hannah didn't just tell Taylor what was going on, or why Taylor didn't recognise a character she'd no reason to forget) and I slightly resented coming to love a character who had deliberately stomped on another character's fingers (with all his considerable body weight *and* heavy boots). Things like that. And the seeming lack of necessity for there to have been QUITE so much tragedy and misfortune in everyone's lives, except to leave things where they needed to be.

It was recommended to me by my sister Amy, and it was only on this recommendation that I didn't abandon it in the first 100 or so pages.

And if that doesn't tell you anything about the actual story, that is OK. I think that you need to have this book unfold for you to really get the full impact. I know I need time to let it all settle before I start a new book, and I am completely happy for that.",0,oldest,[]

Plus, I wouldn't want to forget that I attempted it once and try a second time in my more senile years!Plot (as far as I can tell): Taylor goes to a weird military-seeming boarding school after being abandoned by her parents and is placed in charge of basically a fraternity/sorority of ""underground"" kids that think way too highly of themselves and put too much faith into speaking in code. There's a woman she's close to in the school and she dreams of being in love. I'm kind of in shock as to why I couldn't force myself to read it. I read rave reviews from revered Goodreads personalities and got the title from a list of ""must reads"" somewhere in the social media abyss, but unlike some of the reviewers, I found the prose heavy, murky, and droll. The flashbacks/internal thoughts mixed with the actions didn't flow, and I don't need over 300 pages of suffering to sift through it. Taylor didn't compel me to enjoy her character in any way, as she is a brat with a chip on her shoulder despite the advantages normal orphans wouldn't be offered. The worst aspect of all, however, had to be the jargon. I couldn't stand the mention of many artifacts that held no significance to me or any of the characters, like the ""little purple book,"" and I didn't care to read anymore to learn! Instead of intriguing, it was just off-putting, much like how the narration didn't help the reader understand the weird townie vs. boarding school war. It was almost like an idea meant for an elementary audience, but ""beefed up"" to try to make it YA.I don't quit books often. In fact, I only remember quitting two others in the past five years, but I just couldn't go on, and this is someone who is completing a doctorate, has an M.A. in English, reads YA often, and teaches high school.

It’s a joyless and jarring book, with all kinds of ill-fitting elements rammed in together. The first half is mostly about school kids playing a trite game of “territory wars” in a small Australian town. The author treats the game with extreme seriousness and weight, but in reality it’s a mere trifle. The “war” only lasts for 6 weeks each year, there are no real consequences for breaching territory, there’s nothing at stake either externally or personally, the teens could easily seek help from their teachers at any time, and the main character, Taylor Markham, isn’t even all that invested in the banal “war.” Taylor’s got other, more important things to worry about like having been abandoned by her drug addict mother as a child, and having witnessed a man kill himself via a rifle to the head (described with brain chunks and all. Ew!). As a result, the so-called war is little more than a bunch of pathetic, foolish children having hammy, soap opera-style confrontations and saying “You can’t go there, or else…!” for over a hundred pages. Oh, there’s an occasional punch, but it’s nothing to get worked up about. To make matters worse, eventually even the characters realise how pointless the “war” is and abandon the entire thing in an anticlimactic whimper. When even the characters think the central plot is boring and meaningless, that’s a sure sign to the author that her book needs to go back to rewrite. Apart from the so-called war, the book also features flashbacks to a group of teens 20 years ago, and explores Taylor’s search for identity and family. The flashbacks aren’t all that successful, chiefly because the past characters experience some serious, serious trauma that makes the present-day story seem even more lightweight and meaningless. For example, one repeated flashback depicts a girl surviving an horrific car crash and watching her mother getting decapitated right before her eyes. (Again, ew! Such exceedingly grotesque images are tonally jarring). How on earth are we supposed to care one iota about Taylor Markham’s schoolyard rivalries after reading that?Taylor Markham’s search for identity is not particularly involving either. Taylor is obviously hurting from the separation from her mother and yearning for some sort of connection – that’s fine. But Taylor is a histrionic drama queen who reacts to every minor problem in her life by screaming. Emotion-wise, there’s no perceptible difference between Taylor being abandoned by her mother as a child and Taylor having a petty argument with her sorta, kinda boyfriend. Apart from making Taylor unlikeable, this strips all the impact from the actually serious, life-changing events in the book. Moreover, because so much of the book is taken up by the tiresome non-war, everything else is left rushed and underdeveloped. This book is unrealistically over-stuffed with some truly HEAVY topics. Apart from the traumatic car crash and suicide scenes, there’s also paedophilia, child prostitution, homelessness, drug addiction, cancer, mental illness, attempted suicide, accidental death, a fire... But these big events aren't explored with much in the way of depth or subtlety. There simply isn't space in the book for that. Some of these events come across as exploitative, as though they were included simply to shock the reader. Others come across as excessively sentimental melodrama.Not to mention, it’s all incredibly predictable. Like, golly gosh, do you suppose there might be some sort of link between the present and past stories?! Golly gosh, could Taylor Markham’s search for family possibly lead her to the group of teens featured in the flashbacks?! Every time a link is “revealed,” I literally groaned in frustration because it was SO BLOODY OBVIOUS. I wouldn’t usually complain about this, except that the author uses such flimsy, bald-faced plot devices to artificially extend Taylor’s search for her family. Like, Taylor has been cared for by a woman who knows the whole story, but chosen not to say anything for positively no discernible reason. And Taylor discovers a manuscript depicting the events on the teens 20 years ago – but it is conveniently unfinished and then stolen before she can read it all. Not to mention that Taylor has conveniently forgotten or repressed the memory of every significant event in her life – until the opportune moment when her memory suddenly returns(!). And isn’t it a tad unbelievable that 
all
 the characters were known by completely different names as teenagers? These contrivances had me rolling my eyes. I just couldn’t become engaged with the story because the way it unfolds was so nonsensical. Oh, and there’s also this totally random serial killer subplot that, unsurprisingly, goes nowhere. That sentence plainly has nothing to do with anything previously mentioned in this paragraph, but the serial killer subplot plainly has nothing to do with anything in this book.The bottom line is this book was an absolute chore to read. I will gladly admit that there are some fleeting, isolated scenes that were dramatically effective and for that reason I can kinda understand why some readers absolutely love this book. For example, there's what might be the perfect teen sex scene - a scene that manages to be both emotionally intense but also painfully realistic. But for me there was just too much padding in this book for me to give it anything other than a 1 out of 5. With absolute honesty, when I finished this book I was downright relieved I didn’t have to put up with any more of Taylor Markham’s crap.",0,default,[]

It was, as many reviewers confirmed, very confusing to start with. This story is really in a nutshell about a 17 year old girl wanting family. Taylor was abandoned by her drug addicted mother at a petrol station when she was 11. She is being raised by her guardian Hannah and all the while Taylor pines for her mum and then goes on a journey to find her. If that was all the book was about, it would've been great. But no, the story oscillates between Taylor's life at school, the territory wars, backflashes to before Taylor was born, Taylor's life at home, Taylor's blossoming romance, blahdee blahdee blah.

The characters aren't fleshed out until the very end and by then I was so over this book. It tried too hard to be enigmatic and was just plain confusing.

I got as far as 10 chapters and desperately wished for that eureka moment when the book finally hit me hard with a sudden feeling of amazement and understanding of the story and turn ""Huh??"" into ""Bravo!"" and join the long list of 5 stars givers. Only that was hardly the case. This story about territorial war between these teenagers is confusing me, sometimes it's described as a very serious bullying, almost like a matter of life and death if you get caught within other's territory, and sometimes it is described like some harmless competition between schools, I dont know...I do like a few characters in the story, like Hannah and her mature responses to Taylor's bitter comments, but as interesting as they are, I need a good story that develops from time to time, the storyline that structures the book and excites me to keep on reading because it is leading you to a place you are curious about. And after 10 chapters, and going back to reading those out of this world reviews and WoW ratings, all I was curious about was, ""Are we really reading the same book here, guys??""",5,default,[]

It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.""

For the first 75% of this book, I had no idea what was going on. Then in the last 25% of the book, everything made some sense. I feel I am judging two different parts of the book. The way this novel is constructive makes it very confusing. You spent most of our time reading this trying to understand what's going one. Because of this, you tend to really lose connection to the characters and the plot. Marchetta really banks on the latter portion of the book to tie everything together, which may work for some, but it did not work for me.I had no connection to the plot, characters, or to the writing. Even though I significantly enjoy the last portion of this book, it wasn't enough to overcome the clunky beginning. This book requires at least two reads to really get the full effect of this book, which, to me, is unacceptable.

My friends and people I follow on here generally seem to like it. I just don't get the hype. I couldn't get through it. At one point, I had to force myself to keep reading. I started reading it in October, two months ago, but stopped and decided to read it some other time because I couldn't get into it back then. Yet, this time, I still couldn't get into it.I've thought of two reasons why I didn't like this book:- Too many freaking characters. And they all get freaking nicknames too. I generally dislike unnecessary nicknames in books, but I hate it more when everybody seems to be addressed with multiple names. I lost track of who's who. I can't even see the significance of The Hermit or the boy in the tree in the book. Obviously I would if I'd paid better attention or read back a bit, but I can't bring up the effort for this book.- Nothing is ever explained clearly. Again, if I'd paid more attention I probably would understand it all, but so many things are left unsaid and with this book I really couldn't go with it.And furthermore, the plot just didn't interest me. The boarding school story and the territory wars were just confusing. Maybe I would've liked the plot if it was written better for my liking - I did like the lost mother aspects, for example.I can't really see why other people like this book.

She realizes that it might have something to do with her mother, who abandoned her when she was a child.I didn’t get this book. The writing is confusing and there was something that made me not care about the characters. Parts of the book were good, and the ending was beautiful. However, I didn’t get caught up in it. Taylor isn’t very likeable. Characters don’t have to be. Actually, the most wonderful characters are often not very sympathetic, but Taylor is difficult and tiresome in some way.The tone is somewhat gabby, as many young adult books are. There should be a way to bring forward the substance in the story without so much babble.The territory wars between the factions was interesting.

I've heard so many people rave about Marchetta's novels and I recently read and adored Looking for Alibrandi. On the Jellicoe Road, however, did not click for me.There's no denying that Marchetta has a way with words. Her writing really is amazing, but it was the plot that put me off it. At the beginning I had no idea what was going on (that confusion lasted for at least half of the book) and by the time it did start making sense, I just didn't care anymore.The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of just one is because the ending did make me rather emotional and if a book can make me feel something then it deserves more than just one star. I will admit that the ending did bring a few tears to my eyes, but that was the only part that made me feel much.Thankfully it was a rather short read otherwise I probably would have DNFed it. My expectations were too high and it just wasn't the book for me. Don't let my review put you off though, because as I said, it is an unpopular opinion and everyone else I know has raved about it.Side note: I got a copy of Saving Francesca at the same time as I got On the Jellicoe Road...

La primera mitad del libro me resultó desquiciante, me obligué a seguir leyendo porque intuía que todo tendría una razón de ser, y sí... al final la tuvo, pero ¿es necesario que me pase medio libro sin tener ni idea de lo que me está contando la autora? Me sentí como si me soltara en un lugar que no conocía, con gente que no conocía... ahí, indefensa, viéndolas venir, mirando a todas partes sin saber qué carajo pintaba yo allí. Es que incluso me pareció escuchar a la autora susurrarme al oído: ""ahí te quedas, bonita"".Puede que para la mayoría de gente que ha puntuado bien este libro haya sido un punto a favor: la incertidumbre de la primera parte para la posterior sorpresa de la segunda en la que todo se resuelve. A mí sin embargo me sacó de quicio.No voy a criticar la escritura de la autora porque es el único aspecto de la novela que me ha parecido reseñable (de ahí el 2 y no un 1), pero la base principal y la construcción de la historia, y los personajes... no, gracias.La protagonista principal, Taylor, me ha caído como una patada en la espinilla. La relación amorosa no me ha aportado absolutamente nada y me daba muchísima pereza.Por no hablar de la tradición de los Cadetes y demás, me parece absurda. Completamente absurda. Muuuuuy absurda.Sí me ha gustado, como digo, cómo escribe Melina. Mi parte favorita ha sido la que escribió Hannah, es bonita y poética.

It’s confusing, and I found it difficult to figure out what I should care about (which, in the end, meant I cared about nothing). At first there’s the territory war fought between the school, the cadets, and the townies, but there’s no sense of anything being at stake in the war, and this plot just fizzles out, especially after members of the three factions keep hanging out together. So what was the point?The other plot line is about Taylor finding out why her mother abandoned her to be taken in by the Jellicoe School and a woman named Hannah, and finding out what happened to her mother and father. Hannah has disappeared for unclear reasons, and Taylor has been reading the story Hannah’s written about the Jellicoe School when she was there. The problem with the “Hannah’s story” interludes is that I couldn’t tell any of the characters apart. I had no sense of Fitz, Webb, Tate, Narnie, and Jude’s personalities or how they related to each other; in fact, I kept forgetting which ones were siblings or which ones were girls. I also didn’t feel invested in Taylor’s quest to understand her past and Hannah’s story. I felt very detached from this book and found it hard to connect with or care about any of the characters.",0,default,['ya']

I had heard that it was such an emotional, moving and beautiful contemporary, which are my favorite kind, (like The Sea of Tranquility and Hopeless) Alas, this was not the case for me. I could see where people would get that, and I could tell that the author was trying to make it be like that, but I was just never invested.Plot- The plot for this is very simple, yet very complicated all at once. The base plot is simple- Taylor's mother abandoned her a long time ago, and now she wants to discover her past. There's a lot more than that though, and at time it was very confusing. There were two parts to this story, the past and the present. At first, you're meant to not know how they connect, and then later it's revealed in a ""shocking"" twist, but I knew from the start how it all went together. This was a disappointment for me, because I wasn't shocked at any point in this book. I didn't like how nothing was really explained until over 100 pages in, I understand trying to keep ""an air of mystery"" but I think this one crossed the line a little too much. There was an interesting aspect of ""territory wars,"" which I liked, but that's pretty much the only time I was really interested in the story. I found it quite boring most the time, and I was never really caring what was going to happen next, thus making me not want to pick it back up whenever I put it down. I wasn't invested into the emotional side of the story either. I felt like it could have been done very well, but I wasn't attached. I liked what she tried to do however, and I appreciated how well it all connected, I just wish it was executed differently.Writing- This was definitely the book's strongest point. Marchetta has amazing writing. It's all very lyrical, and a lot of the time there are paragraphs where it feels like you're floating in a dream. At times, this can make the story hard to understand, but overall I really enjoyed this author's writing. I thought the dialogue had some humor to it a midst this darker plotline. I want to read more of her work, just to experience the writing again. It does my favorite thing: it's lyrical, but still feels real. It's not so poetic that it takes you away from reality, there's still some feel of the narrator's personality, and it's still believable.Characters- I also had major issues with the characters. I was not attached to any of them. I didn't really care for any of them at all, not even the main love interest, which usually I'll harbor some feelings for by the end of the book. I can acknowledge that the author didn't make them all the same, but none of them stood out to me, nor did I really like any of them, especially the characters from ""the past."" It took me nearly until the end of the book to finally get it straight for who was related/in a relationship with who. I didn't care enough to pay attention to them, and they weren't memorable at all. I don't have much to say about them because I don't really remember them and it's only been one day. I do like that our main character got some type of character growth, and I really hold a lot of stock in that, so that did appease me. Even though separately I don't remember much about the characters, as a whole, I like how they were written. I liked their dialogue's with each other, and I liked how they interacted. Another major issue I had was there was really no descriptions on their physical appearance I can honestly say that besides Jonah, and Santangelo, I have no idea at all what any of the character's look like. That really bothered me, and it made me have a hard time getting into the story because I couldn't really picture any of the characters.Overall- Sadly, I don't think this was the book for me. I thought it was average in terms of an ""emotional contemporary."" I appreciate what the author was trying to do, and I liked some of the unique things about it, but it just wasn't really my cup of tea. I didn't not like reading it, but just when I wasn't reading it, I didn't have any drive to get back into it. I don't think I will be recommending it to my friends, but I won't be swaying people away from reading it either. I'm still very interested to read her other works though because the writing was great, and I have faith that she can do much better.",0,default,[]

This is this month's book. I didn't cry. I didn't clutch this book to my chest. I only thought 'wow, this is very well written' and that's the sole emotion Jellicoe Road stirred inside me. That's probably because I'm Taylor in most ways. I'm a survivor and I didn't relate to this book. At all. I have lived through a car crash, saw my uncle's smashed body on the pavement and... I didn't think. Everyone's reactions in this book fell out of place to me. When someone dies in front of you, you don't think about what your little brother is going to see. You just don't think. You're not that bloody calm and rational about the whole thing. I hated how pretty the prose was to describe everything that was awful in a cute little way that wasn't visceral, that was so freakingly insightful. The right word, at the right time, while when someone dies in front of you it's messy and sticky and you're yelling. And yelling. And they take you away and you're still yelling. You never stop yelling, in fact. I hated how character's reactions were excused, a part of their personal tragedy. From murders to Taylor's attitude, everything was excused and no one addressed it. No one put their big people's pants and said: it's still wrong. In real life, there is no excuse. Oopsie-doopsie, the answer is in your past. The answer is in your parents' past. The answer is in my past, but it's not in your present. Coming of age sanction: denied! This is your story but it's not about you. This is what this book seemed to me. It was written from a survivor's point of view but it was really just about other survivors. It had too many layers of plot of another plot for me to relate. This was supposed to be Taylor's story, but it's not. It's about a serial killer, Hannah's past and her mother and her father and the Hermit's suicide and... not her. Never her. Oh, it's about her romance with a cadet too. But her? Psst. She will grow up once everyone's shit is figured out. She will forget her angst once she gets her tongue down her romantic interest's throat. Yeah, well no thanks. This book was 'meh' at best. A well written 'meh' that takes 200 pages to refrain from being so boldly and uselessly confusing. This had a The Lottery feel to it and it also failed where it did: oblivious adults, kids with more to their past, kids going to war for no freaking reason, kids fighting for no freaking reason, kids with history falling in love so they can forget their past together... I hate books with oblivious adults. I hate books that treat suicidal thoughts like something that doesn't creep in your mind to stay. I hate books that portray a suicidal individual who only needed to be told to not do it. It's not that easy, it's not that simple.I hate books with a plot that is really just: people are keeping secrets from you.I hate books that worry more about the prose than clarity or the main character's development. I hate books that win awards they don't deserve. There.

This book makes ten (out of eleven) disappointing reads this month. So many five star reviews for this one! I really expected awesome things from this book. But I was completely confused by the whole concept of the boarding school, because it seems like the kids are completely unsupervised. Is this Lord of the Flies? Am I just clueless because I grew up in USA suburbia? (probably) Second, I didn't like any of the main characters (I really didn't like Taylor), and that made it difficult for me to care about the actions. Third, I was annoyed at the amount of information that was intentionally withheld from me. And fourth, the concept of an annual territory war was boring and childish.Here is some scintillating dialogue between Taylor (representing the Jellicoe School), Santangelo (representing the Townies) and Jonah (representing the Cadets):
“You promised us a negotiation about the Club House,” Santangelo says, still eyeing Jonah Griggs, but speaking to me. “Negotiations are over,” I say flatly. “You can’t do that.” “Any which way, we’ve got the Club House and you can’t stop us from getting there,” Jonah Griggs says arrogantly. “Watch me.” “If we make a deal over the Club House, it will be profitable for all of us,” Santangelo says. “Come within an inch of our property…” “And what?” Jonah Griggs calls over to me. “Unfortunately the state persists in using our school as a juvie centre when it suits them. We have arsonists.” “So you’ll burn us down?” he says, feigning fear. “No, but we will burn down every single building you own on our property. Beginning with the Club House.” Now I have their attention.
The amount I care: 0%(Admittedly, later in the book these territory wars are put into proper context and they became less annoying.)I am always down for romance, so the romance bits appealed to me, but the territory wars were tedious and the ""I know something but I'm not telling"" mystery bits were grating.Lots of reviews said that everything would come together in the second half, so I didn't give up. But I never grew to love it.All the mystery about who was whom was all fairly clear to me early on (much earlier than it becomes clear to Taylor), which made the disjointed, nonlinear story-telling style even more annoying. There was no purpose to it, other than to add a needless layer of faux-mystery. I think this would have been stronger if it had been handed out directly instead of coyly slipping a little bit a little bit a little bit.",0,default,"['young-adult', 'coming-of-age']"

Despite having always kept aloof from the other students, her senior status earns her the position of dorm head, leaving her in charge of waging the annual war the school students fight against the local Townies and the Cadets who make camp once a year on school grounds. It's difficult for Taylor to focus on winning back territory for the school when she's worried about the disappearance of the woman who's the closest thing she's ever had to a mother and when the head of the Cadets just happens to be the boy she ran away with four years ago. The escalating tensions among the groups lead to violence, and eventual revelations about a tragedy that happened on the Jellicoe Road oh-so-many years ago.One might be forgiven for initially mistaking Jellicoe Road for dystopian fiction. The curt prose paired with the emphasis on the battle among the warring factions (as well as the power dynamics which bring our outside heroine to leadership) feel more like the opening of The Hunger Games than anything else. I've actually taken part in dorm wars before, and while I'd never say we didn't take things seriously (We had dorm cheers.And jingles. And a bloody dress code.) at no point was the drama ratcheted up to Apocalypse the way it is here. Once you get past the first hundred pages or so, the feeling of trepidation that someone's going to throw a near sighted kid off a cliff eases a bit and it becomes clear we're in for more of a sins-of-the-past-generation-get-made-right-in-the-present kind of thing, with a few random bits of supernatural dreamquest thrown in for shits and giggles. It's here that the novel really starts to find itself, and becomes not just interesting but honestly affecting emotionally. I'd have gotten a bit sniffly, only the author opening with a 76th Annual Hunger Games vibe kind of warned me to not get too emotionally attached to anybody.Despite being a bit of a hot mess in an MFA project kind of way, Jellicoe Road clearly demonstrates Marchetta's promise as a writer. Hopefully the next thing I read by her will be more at home in its own skin, and less likely to have me picturing the heroine blowing a conch while dashing her head against a tree.",0,default,"['2016-reads', 'teen-young-adult-whathaveyou']"

I tried, but I couldn't bring myself to do so.I've probably lost count as to how many times I've seen someone telling me to read a Marchetta book. They all say that she's the best author and everyone needs to read one of her books and how their lives would be better. I can't say that this book changed my life. In all honestly, I'm starting to feel like Marchetta and her books are a bit overhyped. I always try to gives those books a shot and once I read them I can confirm my overhyped suspicions, which are almost always right, and I was right again here. I liked this book, it was simply fine for me, but I didn't love it and nothing really jumped out as being amazing or spectacular. I was expecting stellar and beautiful writing but I didn't really get that. Sure, there were some sprinkles of beautiful and deep writing here and there but it didn't feel consistent to me. My biggest problem was how long it took for this story to make sense. Like literally nothing made sense until the halfway mark. It all came together after that, but it shouldn't take that long for a contemporary book like this to make sense. I understood that this was about a mystery and of Taylor figuring out the story, all of that I didn't mind, but everything that had to do with Taylor's life and her world was a big question mark to me. I didn't understand the purpose of the territory wars or what they were even about and I couldn't see why they were of such importance. It felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story and was forced to go along with it even though I had just started it. The dual narratives definitely didn't help but once I saw that it was Hannah's story intertwined with Taylor's I didn't mind. And actually, I enjoyed that story more than Taylor's and I ended up enjoying how they intertwined and reflected one another. I think I connected more to Hannah's story than I did with Taylor's and I wish that this book was about that instead. There was far too much confusion in this book for me to actually enjoy it and it was almost as if it was too late once it all started making sense. I couldn't connect with the characters, the romance felt relatively bland and a bit choppy, and I just couldn't see the worth in all of it. It was fine, especially near the end, but not fantastic. I'll give Marchetta one more shot to impress me but if she doesn't I'll have no problem writing her off as overhyped.You can read a more detailed review of this book on my blog!!https://bookstrustandpixiedust.wordpr...",0,default,"['young-adult', 'mystery', 'contemporary']"

When Taylor’s guardian, Hannah, goes missing, Taylor starts reading the manuscript that Hannah left behind. As she puts together the clues in the manuscript, she discovers her own history and the history of the territory wars.There are a few elements of this book that I really like. First, it’s set in rural Australia, which isn’t a setting I’ve seen very often before. I also like the slow way that the pieces of Taylor’s life fall into place. The book starts out confusing because there are so many mysteries, but they are all solved by the end. I enjoyed trying to put the pieces together as Taylor uncovered more and more information. This novel is also very well-written, and I’d love to read more of Melina Marchetta’s work.Maybe I’m too old for this book. I think teenage-me would have appreciated it more than twenties-me. I struggled with this novel because Taylor’s angst got on my nerves. The beginning of this book is so mysterious that it’s confusing, and I didn’t understand why Taylor was so overdramatic about everything. Even after finishing the book, I didn’t think she needed to be so angsty. I was constantly annoyed at her.Most of the book focuses on the territory wars, which I may be too old to find interesting. The territory wars are a game that the teenagers play. They invade each other’s territory, take hostages, and negotiate for land around the school campus. Sometimes the players take the game too seriously, and somebody gets hurt. I found the territory wars childishly pointless. I think I would have liked the book a lot more if the wars had taken up less space. I considered giving up on the book several times because I just couldn’t get invested in the wargames story.Finally, I wondered why Taylor’s past is a mystery at all. Why couldn’t the adults in her life just act like adults and talk to her about her parents? Why does her family history have to be a deep, dark secret? I don’t get it. The lesson that I’m taking away from this book is “use your words.” A lot of angst can be prevented if people just talk to each other.",0,default,['young-adult']

Maybe this would've been better in paper (almost undoubtedly). It took me far too long to realize that there were two narrators. Everything's jumbled in time to boot. I get why this was a thing, I just don't think it was at all worth the trouble. Plus the whole ""mystery"" of the book wouldn't have existed if one goddamned adult had sat down with Taylor and told her things she had every right to know right from the start!! What the hell!! Tell the damn girl what's up with her life!And the selective amnesia thing? What?Taylor was a terrible character. She started off whiny and self-pitying but mostly ok and ended up a hellish, egocentric brat who somehow comes off as spoiled, of all things, despite having a rough childhood. Everything is overly dramatic and syrupy. It was like reading a regular book put through a honey-gold filter.

Joining me for this review is Abbie, a friend from my class. We decided to give this book a two out of five, simply for our appreciation of the story, the characters and the writing style, when in fact, we did not particularly enjoy or like the book.SUMMARY (without including Hannah's story): Taylor Markam is not your average boarding school student. Having been abandoned by her troubled mother at a 7/11 when she was only a few years years old, she was found by a lady called Hannah, who brought her to her house and raised her as her own. Now seventeen, Taylor is selected to become the head of the Boarders at a rural Australian school in a series of territorial disputes between the school children / the Boarders, the Townies (children who live in the town), and the Cadets (who come every year for a couple of months). Taylor is not supported by her fellow students as she outcasts herself by removing her mind from her body and often taking a back-seat role in her life. Furthermore, she seems afraid of intimacy, as she declares in the first couple of pages, although it becomes apparent that she is not just anti-social, but pushes herself away from others (either to protect herself or to protect them from her, we know not). Taylor has a blemished history at the Jellicoe School, having run away with a Cadet when she was seven, only to be brought back by the Brigadier, a mysterious and somewhat under-used character whose persona is really rather confusing. (view spoiler)[When Hannah, Taylor's mentor, goes away suddenly, Taylor's already confusing life begins to spiral even further downwards. It turns out that the now head of the Cadets was the Cadet that she ran away with, Jonah Griggs, and that her seemingly only female friend has been in a relationship of some sort with the head of the Townies, Santangelo. The story progresses and the Territory Wars seem to decrease in complexity and interest as Hannah's quest for self-identity becomes the focus of the story. Hannah finally returns to Sydney while her romantic relationship with Griggs progresses and as she looks for her mother. Eventually, she finds out that the characters in Hannah's story were actually real - Narnie is Hannah, another character is her mother and others in the story also have ties to Taylor. (hide spoiler)]WHAT I LIKED: I'm a positive person, so I am going to start with what I enjoyed about the book. Ms. Marchetta, you write a good Jonah Griggs. Griggs is not your typical manly man or your artsy fellow, but he was a character who I found unique and relatable. He was a beacon of hope, having overcome suicidal thoughts with the concepts of love. How romantic. And of course, separately, the two stories of the different times are well written, unique, and engaging. I personally loved the first two pages. It seemed throughout the book, even from the very start, there were moments of hope, despair and life's wisdom in this novel that made it worth the read. Parts of the imagery and details are fabulous and a pleasure to read. The style of the time jumps are interesting. I am not saying that I appreciated and/or enjoyed them, as I am quite an impatient reader, but they were interesting. I also liked the diversity of the characters in this book. It is not often that you find people of such diverse opinions, backgrounds, ideas and pasts who can relate to one another. They are all perfectly developed and complemented one another. Let's leave the positives for now and talk about what we did not completely like about this book. Please do not be offended by anything that we have said or will say below. Book critiquing is a matter of opinion, so you are perfectly entitled to yours. I hope that you believe the same about us.WHAT I DISLIKED: While we recognised that the story was broken into both Hannah's book/past and Taylor's present-day life, it seemed to be extremely disjointed without purpose. On the Jellicoe Road certainly played on the shock value. Taylor had many issues, too many, it seemed at points, to make her a feasible 17 year old. She'd suffered under a pedophile. She'd been abandoned by her drug addict mother. Her confidante and mentor, Hannah, had simply and randomly disappeared, and had always been distant towards her compared with the obvious love she had shown other boarding school students. She had run away from home. She had witnessed a person committing suicide. She had no ability to feel emotion until halfway through the story, at which time it seemed unlikely that she would ever do so, but she radically changed and 'came out of her bubble' and started to live her own life. Her boyfriend had tried to commit suicide. Her father was not present throughout her childhood. She had lived in the worst parts of Sydney as a young girl. She had never had any real friends as she was afraid to love. While at times all these past issues made Taylor a deep, wizened and loveable voice and narrator, at other times, we had to put down the book and talk about how realistically a teenager would have had all those experiences.Another evident issue was the fact that the story was unrealistic. Coming into the novel, reading the back cover, looking at the front cover (I know that we shouldn't judge a book by the cover, however it is still good to look at it), doing a little background research of the plot line and reading a couple of reviews, we certainly did not expect the story to be what it was. A slightly confusing plot line, jumping noticeably and irrationally, between the past and the present, it was not clear to the reader what the purpose of the italicised text was for quite a ways into the novel. Getting started was the hardest part of the book. We had been forewarned that we should read at least up until page 100 before we made our judgements, but to be honest, we both found it hard to get past the first chapter. I enjoyed the first two pages and Taylor's narration of the dream she had been having, but beyond that, I saw no life in the story. I put the book down, but came back to it the next day. It took me several cups of coffee and tea to finish. It was not, at least in my view, a story that was hard to put down - rather, it was hard to pick up. Well! A lot of text for the negatives there. While I did not like many things about the book, it is a definitely re-read for me. I think, then, I would probably enjoy it more. Also, I spent quite a lot of time talking about what I did not like - not because I didn't like it, but rather, because it is quite hard to explain.QUOTES:""My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die. I counted."" Wow. That hooked me from the beginning. That's the kind of writing I love. I really liked how it tied back to the ending with Taylor's mother taking seventeen years to die.""...there is no place in my life for sentimentality."" This phrase sums up Taylor in a couple of words. I find this concept so beautifully endearing, yet so estranged from me that I just had to include it.Matthew 10.26 - 'So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered up that will not be uncovered, and nothing secret that will not become known.' This is one of my favourite Bible verses, so it really made the story personal to me.It's too long to include but the beginning of Chapter 15 was stunning. It was this kind of passage that made me want to keep reading, when it started to drag slightly.THE ENDING: The best part of the book. That is all. With the smattering of inspiration throughout the novel, the ending really brought the full on impact of these ideas.RECOMMENDATIONS: As hard as it is to confess that this book was not one that we enjoyed, I suppose that I will have to recommend it because it was not a book I hated. It was thought-provoking. Anyway, this is a book for those who like a challenge to read. Those who read deeply and carefully. Those who like their heroines on the front line, not just calm, collected girls with that one amazing friend. Happy reading and thanks for appreciating our review! xx Aria and Abbie",0,default,"['young-adult-fiction', 're-read-worthy']"

I'm conflicted and a bit angry. I've heard such incredible things about this book, and it has a high rating, but I spent most of my time reading it waiting for it to be over. The problem is that we're thrown into this world with a hundred characters that never get fully developed, which makes it hard to care about any of them. I could barely keep track of any of these characters, especially when they all start mingling. The majority of the book is taken up with the ""wars"" that go on between the kids, and my issues with those are that 1) they're never fully explained and we're supposed to just understand them and go with it, and 2) the apparent reason that teachers have never catch on to these games that have been going on for decades is simply because the turnover rate is so high. My point is that too much time is wasted on the wars, which quickly become irrelevant when suddenly everyone stops beating each other up or holding each other hostage and starts making out and throwing a giant party for all three groups. We spend more than half of the book with these characters hating each other, and in the blink of an eye, all negative feelings are erased. The book completely changes its tone, and everyone is happy and lovely and gets along. Even the main character, Taylor, suddenly becomes more likeable and bearable, and everyone starts to care about her. She magically falls in love with a boy she held a grudge against for years.The final 100 pages of the book are truly the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me forgive it, considering I spent 300 pages questioning what the plot of the story was or if we'd ever get one (spoiler alert: we really don't). The book is scattered with snippets of a book that a character named Hannah wrote, and they turn out to be flashbacks of her teenage years. The problem is that they start way too early in the book, so they're lost within the first pages, and by the time the reader realizes what they are or why they're important, they already missed half the story. One hiccup I caught was that when one of the cadets tells Taylor ""His name is Xavier,"" Taylor doesn't flinch, but when he says his full name, she reacts. But if Taylor read all of Hannah's story in one sitting, she would know his full name, because there are times he's called by both his first and middle names. I know they're inconsistencies and I'm probably nitpicking, but if you're going to write a book about four characters and their parallels to five characters from 20 years ago, consistency is key. I don't know. I was expecting so much more from this, and I wonder if everyone else who loved it was initially as thrown off as I was. The difference is that everyone else probably forgave the rocky beginning and got their hearts ripped out by the ending, while I grew more impatient with the logistics as the story went on.

I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because I really liked the last 100 pages. But overall, it was very whatever, and I really don't understand all the hype this book got. There were SO many things about it that annoyed me. For one, it's one of those books that just throws you into the action without explaining ANYTHING and leaving you scrambling to figure out what the hell is going on. The first 100 pages were extremely painful to get through because it was so confusing. To add to the confusion, a million and a half characters are thrown at you in those first 100 pages and you're expected to keep track of who's a Cadet and who's a Townie and who the five people are in the italicized sections that don't seem to have anything to do with the other plot you're trying to keep track of. Another thing that bugged me was that the author gave very few physical descriptions of characters. That should be introduced early on because it helps readers picture who they're reading about. For some of the characters, descriptions were revealed throughout the book, but for almost all of them, we never got to know what they looked like. I liked how the two plots came together (even though I would say it was pretty predictable--I was not shocked at all), and I really liked the ending. But I really don't think the author did a good job with characterization at all. I didn't feel like I got to know the characters, probably because there were so many of them, not even the main character.",0,default,['2017']

Then the book takes a turn for the better and aspects of the structure start to make sense, but it doesn't make sense in it's entirety because a better thought out book wouldn't have me loathing to read the entire first half. I do think a reread would help me appreciate this book more, but I shouldn't have to suffer through half a book of not caring and then it shouldn't require a reread in order for me to appreciate it fully. Were the beginning of the book better structured in the sense of it's pacing, this book could have easily obtained a much higher rating. As it is with the aforementioned above issues (and me hating molasses slow pacing) I couldn't give this more than a two. This book was clearly not for me.

At first, I didn't know it was writing and didn't know whose words they were...the whole book is that way...it unfolds in layers and pieces which is the amazing part of it.

They tell me how good it is and other things that equate to a red blinking sign screaming HYPE! HYPE! HYPE! Books that are overhyped and I typically don't get along and so I resisted and then I tried it and I put it down after a chapter. I tried this several times and each time I kept putting it down and telling people that it probably wasn't for me even though I adored Finnikin of the Rock, Froi of the Exiles and Quintana of Charyn. Everyone then told me that I had to read past 150 in order to 'get' Jellicoe Road and to fall in love with it. 150 pages?!?! That is almost half way through the book and long past my cut off mark. It shouldn't take 150 pages for a story to get good. Then I made a deal with Andi of AndiABCs, I would read Jellicoe Road if she read Finnikin of the Rock. As my love for Finnikin knows no bounds this was determination enough to plow through the angst filled book that was Jellicoe Road.Oh my stars was this book filled with angst and unnecessary conflicts and drama! The adults were all selfish and petty putting their wants and needs over the wellfare of those around them. The teens were all so unlikable, especially Taylor, who was the narrator of most of the book. This made it hard to get into the story because I just didn't care about anyone. I also don't get what the big deal is over Jonah Griggs who is nothing more than a bully for much of the book. Then there is the mystery, the story within a story that is supposed to big this big mysterious, edge of your seat thing. The reveal of which is supposed to be so mind blowing that it makes the whole slow moving boring ass book worthwhile. And yet...I figured things out at the beginning of the book so the big reveal kind of fizzeled and I was left thinking...""That's it?"" If these characters just communicated with each other and didn't keep such big secrets for pointless, selfish reasons then most of the 'conflict' in this book could have been resolved before the story had even started.I did managed to get to the end of Jellicoe Road but it was a struggle. I forced myself to turn the pages and it was hard not to fall asleep as it was so darn boring. Kids running around the Australian outback angsting over war games and territory and how they are all broken and oh woe is me. I found myself rolling eyes and sighing the heavy sighs of frustration a lot while reading this one as there seemed to be no point or purpose to the book. This is one that I intially rated as a three star read but the more that I think about it the more I feel that rating was wrong and geared more towards all those I know love the book than my actual reaction. So I've lowered my rating and have given away my book and am just done with Jellicoe Road. I've heard that Marchetta's other contemporaries have that similar 150 page rule so I think that I might just avoid those as well and just stick with her fantasy novels because its just such a different feel to her writing in those and I just like them so much better.

The dialogues, especially the ones with banter, felt unnatural and far-fetched, as I could imagine the author squeezing jokes and teen taunting scenes out of herself.I didn't like the main character. One chapter she's snappish and cold, in another she's all sentimental and caring. As for the other characters, they were too many and none of them has any particular personality, and, as a result, I found it quite difficult to care about anyone. The scene with the House on fire is presented as something horrible and impressive, but if fact, did anyone give a shit about those students whom we don't know? Or Jessa and who, Chloe? Who are they? I mean, I know who they are, but I don't know much about them to be interested in their fate.Moreover, I didn't like that trick of throwing the reader into the mess of the book without any explanation - reading first chapters felt useless as, not caring for the happening and the featuring characters, I didn't and didn't want to understand the situation that was going on. And when it's finally all clear, we're given a few dull scenes and the book is over.The ending is super cheesy and reminds one of a melodramatic film. Also, as the story developed, I had a strong feeling of the author having got tired of writing her novel, because I can't explain that decline in the writing quality closer to the end. There are a lot of repetitive ideas and phrases, a lot of notions connected with ""ands,"" and a huge amount of abrupt ugly sentences.I'm really disappointed.",0,default,[]

I mean is that all you book writers can really think of when you come across the word teenagers. This book was very confusing. The backstory that goes on in parallel with the main story is very very poorly written, and difficult to follow.( One other thing, the five characters Jude, Fitz, Webb, Tate and Narnie have the cringiest character chemistry I have read till date. And btw, where did these guys get their food and money from?)Then there are the territory wars which seems totally absurd and there is no real passion for these wars among any of them. I get it, the writer tried to put in a little flavour of Hunger Games and Divergent and how the boy and the girl falls in love with each other. But here too, she fails miserably.Lastly, the characters. Its relatable what the other reviewers have written about not having a clue till page 100 or so. Because you will be coming across a bunch of them till then without any clue as to who they are or whatever.Mystery my foot. Why did her mother used to tell Taylor that her life is in danger? This is a cheap attempt to get the reader engrossed in the book, but towards the end, the writer must have forgotten about it altogether.And I almost forgot, Taylor cannot remember anything from her past. Yes that's right. But when you reach 75% of the book, she suddenly remembers everything. And no, there was no blow to her head or something.How this book won awards beats me.",0,default,[]

It makes me sad that I didn't like it. I wanted to. This is a good book. I just didn't like it. It is a sad, lovely book but there were some aspects that I just became hung up on and it led to me not liking the book in the end. There was a point in the book where the tragedy turned into melodrama and I just started rolling my eyes. It was the fire. The fire was the point where I turned from loving this book to not liking this book. It was unnecessary and it took me completely out of the story. I never felt like anyone was in any real danger from the fire and it was just one more tragedy on top of all the other tragedies. It really made me think of a Lifetime movie. Believe me, I love a Lifetime movie, but I love it for the cheesy drama, not because it is particularly poignant and moving. Towards the end of the book, I started feeling like there was some kind of checklist of tragedies that were being crammed in there and there was already plenty in this book. By the time I got to the fire, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. The fire also led me to focus on how completely awful all of the grownups are in this book. Raffy is listing off all the kids and what families they are going to stay with and details on all of them while the house mother just stands there. Then I started thinking about how much I disliked all of the adults. They take no responsibility for the kids at all. Teachers usually like kids and want to work with kids. That’s why you go into teaching. I understand that these teachers usually moved on when their time was up at the Jellicoe School, but I can’t believe that none of them seemed to care at all about these kids. None of them. Taylor’s aunt? Forget it. She’s terrible. I understand that she has her own tragedies and is emotionally stunted, but she can’t come up with some way to connect with her own niece? Ugg. Just ugg. She’s the worst.I could really rant for quite some time about all of the adults in this book and their total neglect of the kids that needed them so much. I just found them to be horrible people. I didn’t really buy the romance between Taylor and Jonah. I can understand why they feel drawn to each other. They are both very troubled kids who need professional help (as do most of the kids in this book although only Jonah gets any) and I find it completely believable that they would cling to each other. I just couldn’t be swept along by it because I was too distracted about how troubled these kids were and how much help they really needed and how their love was really just them clinging to each other to escape the reality of their lives. I feel like I was supposed to be seeing them as true soul mates and I just couldn’t. I was really excited about the Territory Wars. Sadly, I thought they were better in theory than in execution. For me, that didn’t really go anywhere. All of that being said, this is a good book. It has some lovely characters and lovely moments. I loved Taylor. Her voice was so raw and painful at times that I couldn’t breathe. She felt so real. I just felt like there were too many bad things shoved in there and I couldn’t help but be distracted by the fact that no one seemed to really care about these kids. ",0,default,[]

Or at least there has to be A LOT of beauty to balance it out for me to be like ‘wow that was a beautiful story’ instead of ‘wow thanks for ripping my heart out and farting on it’. I don’t feel that JR found that balance, at least not for me.That’s not to say that no joy happens in this book, there is definitely joy there, it’s just that it’s battling desperately against this choking depression and sadness and grief pretty much the whole time. I do think that the themes it tackles (abandonment, death, depression, a whole bunch of other stuff, etc.) are presented extremely well and I really applaud how Marchetta handled all of it, it was tactful without pulling any punches. Unfortunately, that’s just not my jam as far as books go! I would rather read something with like an 85/25 light to dark ratio than 45/55, but that’s just my preference. If you prefer your books with a healthy dose of emotional trauma, please pick this up because you will love it. Here Is The Nitty Gritty Bone-Picky Stuff:An avalanche of terrible things happens to the characters in this book. So many things that by the last thing I was like “damn, really????? this on top of everything????”, like it was A Lot. It sort of felt like the point of the book was to make as many bad things as possible happen to these characters, which I find extremely irritating as a plot device.Another thing worth mentioning that I struggled with was the structure: it started out fairly confusing at the beginning, partly because 1) I didn’t know that it was set in Australia until like 100 pages in, and the language was throwing me off (whoops), and 2) there are flashbacks of people from the beginning of the book throughout and you don’t find out what their connection is to the main characters of the story, or even begin to suspect it, until at least ¼ through the book. It felt like a long time of trying to remember what the names and purposes of these characters are and what’s going on in their lives while being unable to connect any dots. Ironically, once the first dot is connected for you, you can immediately guess who everyone is - but it takes the characters another like 2/3 of the book to get to that point. Ugh. It was supposed to be compelling, but it just left me frustrated. Once everything is in place plot-wise, it does flow nicely to the end, but it was definitely a struggle to get there.What About The Good Stuff?As negative as this review has been, I want to stress that this book is not a bad book. It is a good book where bad things happen. Despite the initial struggle to get things on track and making sense, once things do get underway you really get sucked in with the characters and it all ties together in a really poetic way that feels satisfying. The characters are all really lovable and good in a way that feels realistic, which is important to me. I felt the relationships between the main characters could have used some work in the beginning, but once they get there, they’re really lovely relationships. All good things! ",0,default,[]

And I mean that pretty literally, as I found this to be an exceedingly and unnecessarily confusing book. While there may be some merit to the reader being invited into the mystery and confusion with Taylor, I found the jumbled retelling of Hannah's story to be a huge impediment to actually following it, which I realized nearly 100 pages in was going to be a big problem as it's such a significant aspect of the story. I just couldn't keep the characters from that segment straight, they all sort of blended together for me in the same nonlinear swirl their story was told in. So much of the narrative was written as a mystery, but I honestly think it would have worked much better as a more straightforward story without the gimmicks (we could have just known the backstory between Hannah and Griggs up front, Hannah's story could have been told in chronological order, etc.). It's not even that I don't enjoy more creative, innovative writing...for whatever reason it just really didn't work well for me. Beyond that, I had trouble really investing in the other characters (to the point where, again, I literally wondered if I'd read the wrong book after seeing the fanfare for Griggs on here) and they felt pretty thinly drawn to me. I feel like there were some glaring examples of telling rather than showing throughout the book and that's how much of the serious progression happened. We're told that the various leaders begin spending time together and talking about life and so on, but all we see is the initial interactions which made it hard to buy the depth of their bonds later on. We're told Taylor develops a deep love for the girls she oversees after hearing her complaints towards them the bulk of the book without really seeing it. I know I'm in the radical minority here, but there was a serious shortage of depth and richness to the characterization, relationship-building, and plot development for me, and mostly for the sake of constant conversation around territory wars that had radically little bearing on the meat of the story. With all of that said, I did enjoy the final 150 pages of the book quite a bit, which was when the storytelling felt most straightforward and the bulk of the revelations took place, seemingly one after another. I certainly sympathized with Taylor's story, I just wish it had been told, well, differently.",0,default,"['young-adult', 'magical-realism']"

I cannot for the life of me figure out why it's so jam-packed with melodrama, and asks the reader to meet and follow about TWENTY characters' arcs and, sadly, via an unreliable and unlikable protagonist. Very disappointed with this. A compelling read, at times, though I wasn't impressed with the actual writing. The tale of 'the five' was the most interesting thing about it, but it was conveyed via confusing flashbacks read in snatches of an unfinished manuscript. Why? Why did these elder people in the protagonist's life hold these cliched secrets from her? I could not see any reason for this, expect perhaps so that the author could try to sustain suspense...

But all it did was confuse me.I loved Finnikin of the Rock, so I wanted to check out more of Marchetta’s books, and I’d heard lovely things about this one. Unfortunately, everything about it was a mess for me: the plot, the setting…I was just so turned around.So apparently the people at this boarding school of sorts are involved in territorial wars that were started years ago, but nobody really knows why the wars continue, and what their point is? The logic behind these territorial wars was poorly-explained, and I got lost in all the seemingly nonsensical rules involved in the war. My confusion made it difficult for me to picture the setting vividly because I was devoting too much time to trying to figure out what the heck was going on.In addition to the territorial wars, Taylor, our MC, is also struggling with the disappearance of Hannah, who found Taylor on the Jellicoe Road years ago and has been a supportive constant in her life ever since her mother abandoned her. As Hannah’s absence is prolonged, Taylor begins probing into Hannah’s past…and learns more about her own.It turns out Hannah’s past is actually much more closely connected to Taylor’s than Taylor ever could have imagined, and we get snippets of this past throughout the book. However, the way these snippets are interwoven with the main plot (whatever the heck the main plot was, anyway) makes this aspect of the book just one more layer of confusion, and the final twist was so vaguely explained that I actually had to look up a summary of the twist because I’d read it three times and was still confused. Thus, there was never any payoff for me.I can see glimmers of good intention in this book, however. There are some touching, well-written moments where we see the impact of Taylor being abandoned (by more people than just her mom), and where we see her trying to grow into her own identity. I liked those moments. But, unfortunately, the vast majority of this book was me just furrowing my brow, leaving me confused by way more than just the hype.",0,default,['disappointing']

I hated this book with a passion for the first 150 pages and after that it got better but failed to redeem itself altogether in my eyes.

I read a LOT. I enjoy quirky books. This was... pretty awful. It missed the mark. For the first 100 or so pages, I have NO IDEA WTF IS GOING ON. As it continues, it starts to make a little more sense, but it stays so confusing. Part of it for me were the names. I could not keep Narnie, Tate, Webb, Jude and Fitz straight for the life of me. There just wasn't enough to distinguish them from each other, and for the longest time I could t figure out who the girls were or their relationship to each other. I also didn't realize we were reading Hannah's book when it was in italics at first. I didn't think that was explained well enough and it made it even WORSE. It didn't really come off as a ""dual story"" or ""story within a story"" for me, AT ALL. It was mostly annoying. There was some skill at suspense and mystery there, but in the end everything was SO PREDICTABLE. I have issues with Taylor. A LOT of issues. Clearly she has mental health problems, right? Because how did she not remember more? I get psychotic breaks, memory loss for self preservation, whatever. But not remembering who Hannah is? Remembering Jude? Being complacent about this for 6 years? Nobody ever just telling her ""hey Hannah is your aunt, your dad's been dead your whole life, and your mom is a crackhead""? Like how hard was this to figure out? Also even after Fitz BLOWS HIS BRAINS OUT NEXT TO HER EAR, still no one tells her WHY? It was just... It's like one of those movies where if they just had cell phones, there would be no movie. In this book, if they had just LIVED THE TRUTH, this book and imagined drama wouldn't exist. I just don't understand the point of this book and I'm pissed I slogged through it expecting some amazing ending because of all the 4 and 5 star reviews. Bleh. ",0,default,[]

Look, I found nothing wrong with the book. I just...found nothing interesting, either. Not much of a plot was going on, I wasn't very interested in the war between the three (which seemed to almost be the main focus of the book,) and I just found the whole thing boring. It seemed like it had potential, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me.But it worked for a lot of people, and I now find myself once again in this position. It's occurred to me that it usually happens in YA Contemporary Dramas. The Fault in Our Stars had me catching zzz's, Please Ignore Vera Dietz was far too uninteresting and The Catcher in the Rye just had me pissed. Maybe I should just give the genre a break?But then I read books like Before I Fall and The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian and This Song Will Save Your Life and they work for me, you know?

The first 150 pages make a different book than the last 140. The first half overwhelmed me with a whole lot of unexplained story and characters and its hard to remember what you don't understand. By the time I got to the second half, the story began to unravel.Unfortunately I couldn't make much sense of it all in retrospect because reading the first half had left me with a big confusing blur of information. Untangeling it by the time I finally got to the point seemed impossible. I actually feel the need to go back and reread the first half because only then I'd really truly get it. And that's what I think this book is doing wrong.There's a couple of things it's doing right, though, too. Best part? The romance. The relationship that forms between Taylor and Griggs is written beautifully and hit me right in the feels. 2nd bookhalf Taylor is way more relatable than grumpy asshole 1st bookhalf Taylor. The evolution her character goes through in the book is huge and I'm not sure if I wholeheartedly believe it.If the book hadn't changed 180 the second half, I'd have given it 1 star. Because even though it is really well written, I can't deal being flooded with 500 different names to characters that I know nothing about. Even until the end I had trouble picturing them. Because except for ""tall"" or ""young"" there's not much describing happening at all. What does that person look like, what's their deal, what makes them special? How old are they, what kind of impression do they leave? What are they dressing like, what are their habits? Well. No freaking clue.",0,default,['young-adult']

Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find this book to be super special.I had a really hard time getting into it. The way the author just jumps directly into the culture of these three groups of kids without any background was a bit jarring and I found myself trying to figure out what in the heck was going on so much I couldn't enjoy the first 1/3 of the book. I tried to force myself just to read it, knowing that everything would eventually be revealed, but it was hard for me to do.There were points where I thought the book was quite good. Certain passages and wordings were fantastic. I really did like the slow way the author unveiled the story and the meaning behind everything that was going on (though I thought it was a little too slow at times, and some of the reveals were given a lot of weight when it all seemed very obvious and not super important). But, I just couldn't get into the characters. Most of them just seemed really silly to me, and one dimensional. I just wasn't sure what to make of it all for most of the book, so it distracted me from what really was a very beautiful story of friends, and family, and looking out for one another despite differences.Eh, maybe I'm just not deep enough or something to really love this book the way most people seem to.",0,default,"['young-adult', 'novels', 'fiction']"

There were parts were I didn´t understand what was going on.There were pages I had to read THREE TIMES so I could understand. The first time I dropped it I read about 70 pages and I thought it was so so not interesting. A couple months later I grabbed it again, I was like ""cool, let's do this. I can do this. Maybe it gets exciting"". Well, that didn't happen and i Dropped it 100 pages before its end.Let me tell you something more, this was 5-6 months ago and I don't even remember the characters' name.

That's a long ass time.Thirdly, I could see the big reveal/plot twist whatever coming from about 300 pages from the end. That's a long time to wait for the main character to get on your level.

The title was 50% of the reason I picked the book up, the other 50% on the quick synopsis on the book jacket. Now as I write this review, I must say it was a tragic story. It had its light, humorous moments and typical teen romance, but the overall theme was sad. Sadness is a part of life and obviously must be addressed, but this story was a little too sad for my taste. There seemed to be a constant sense of hopelessness with many of the characters and even at the end, I don't really feel a lot of hope from the characters. That does not mean it wasn't interesting...I was up way past my weekday curfew reading page after page.

I read many reviews on this book that went on and on about how amazing it was. I started the book and after 100 pages I felt like I had been tricked. It was awful! The author's writing style drove me crazy and I had no idea what was going on. I went online in search of more reviews and was told by several other book lovers that I needed to press on and soon it would all make sense, come together and be amazing! I read on. After about another 100 pages I felt like giving up. After 250's pages (more than halfway through the book) things finally started to fall in place, but I wasn't impressed. I was so annoyed with the book at this point I just wanted it to be over. The last 50 pages told a real heartfelt story and redeemed this book from the land of 1 star ratings.

I feel like I’m confessing a crime. I don’t want to say it, I cringe thinking about it, but I can’t just change how I feel. I’m realizing that I am in the minority of people who didn’t absolutely love this book that had them gasping with wracking sobs. Hence, I feel like people are eying me with some distaste or confusion. So, here it is, my confession: I couldn’t love this book. I know what you’re thinking. How could you not? This book is stunning, breathless, heartbreaking. It had me weeping, and I finished the book in utter awe at the story and how Marchetta orchestrated it, and the characters that just stole into my heart with their heartbreaking stories. Are you just emotionless and don‘t know a good story when it hits you in the face? No, I’m not, this story just didn’t captivate me the way other stories I love do. Stories like The Girl with Glass Feet and Heart's Blood. But while those stories that I treasure are not meant for everyone, Jellicoe Road isn’t for everyone. Sadly, this is the case for me.Now, I didn’t hate the book. No, I didn’t. Honestly, I liked it. But that’s it. I just liked it. It wasn’t earth shattering, or stunning. It didn’t make me breathless, or make me cry. I so wanted to love it. I’ve read so many glowing reviews about it that I was so sure it would be a beautiful, poignant story that I would love utterly. And I tried to love it. I tried to feel with the characters, to understand them, to love the writing and appreciate where Marchetta was going with it all. But I could never quite latch onto that enchantment. I think it was the writing that stilted the story for me. I didn’t really care for it. It is unique, and I love when authors can find their own, original voice that differentiates them from the rest of the writers out there, so I give her props for having a distinct voice. Her writing style does have a certain charm to it, I can see it, I just never quite felt it. It seemed a little weird and random at times. As a result, the characters never did reach into my heart very far. Yes, there were times when I felt for them, when I yearned with them and wanted them to find their story and past and figure out how knowing would make them a better, stronger person, but they didn’t cry out to me with heartfelt emotion.And I had a difficult time actually getting into the story. It took almost 3/4ths of the book before I become really intrigued and felt more emotion from the characters and felt my heart melt just a little. The beginning was confusing, but then it started making a little more sense, and I became intrigued. I can see why so many people love Jellicoe Road. There are beautiful, heartbreaking moments in it, that perhaps if the writing was different, I would feel them more. It is an intriguing story, with honest, real characters, and an original plot that twisted and jumped, keeping you guessing. There were sweet, tender moments that made me smile. There were lovely moments that made my heart bloom a little with love and a subtle contentment. But those feelings didn’t last long enough to cement in my heart solidly. Journeying with the Jellicoe Road was interesting, confusing at times, it had it’s sweet moments, but it had it’s dull moments. This story will captivate many, I just wasn’t one of them. It’s sad, but true. I would still like to read Marchetta’s other books, the urge just isn’t pressing. I would say though to those who have yet to read this book, when you read it, read it for yourself, make the journey with the characters, press on through the slow beginning, and you may just love it. I hope you do.",4,default,"['cover-love', '2011-reads', 'original-creative-premise', 'so-wanted-to-love', 'could-have-been-better', 'realistic-fiction', 'i-own']"

I read the five stars glowing reviews about this book. I push through the first hundred pages even though I was confused and lost because I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to experience for myself what the hype was all about.Yet it just didn't do it for me. Marchetta got me at the prologue. She reeled me in but then she lost me at chapter one. She left me there by myself and I found trying so hard to sort out the two point of views and the whole game between the territory and what is actually going on in the book.It is not any means a bad read. The way Marchetta writes is so simple that I think readers don't realize how well her words flow together or how pretty they are.There are quotes like this in the book""When I turn around, he cups my face in his hands and he kisses me so deeply that I don’t know who is breathing for [whom], but his mouth and tongue taste like warm honey. I don’t know how long it lasts, but when I let go of him, I miss it already."" and quotes like this ""It’s funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that’s why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It’s not the pain they’re getting over, it’s the love.I mean it takes massive talent to just write like that, the way she can produce something so simple to something so lyrical.The thing is that, it was too little too late for me with this book because I found myself wanting to quit halfway but I pushed through wanting to understand all of the hype and love for this book. I want to know where the story was actually leading. But being lost for half the book left me annoyed, frustrated and not being able to connect with the characters or really care to be quite honest.The thing with me is that the writers have to be able to pull me in, either by the plot within the first hundred pages or with the characters. This book gave me neither. I was just kind of relief and happy by the end that I was able to pull through this book without quitting. I would've dock this book off another star if not for the ending. The way she was able to wrap up the story and weaved the two storylines together was handled really nicely. But to tell you that this book moved me would be a lie. I'm one of the minority on here that found this book okay, it wasn't crazy astounding. The simple truth is that I know that I won't find myself remembering these characters for too long or going back to revisit their story again in the long run.",5,default,"['young-adult', '3-stars']"

On The Jellicoe Road and I started off pretty badly. I had borrowed this book from the library 2 months before and never got motivated to finish it. When I realised my due date was coming up, I decided to pick this up. It was terribly confusing at first, and I honestly could not be any more bored by the story.I didn't understand the correlation between the two stories that were being told at the same time. I couldn't separate what was real and what was fake. (Helpful hint: Some parts of the story are Hannah's manuscript. If you're reading the ebook then it means that the parts completely italicized are the manuscript. The rest is Taylor's story).However, Melina Marchetta had a beautiful and surreal way of writing. You couldn't help but feel as if you were in Jellicoe Road and walking through the forrest and climbing the trees. It makes me want to visit Australia even more than I already do.

“I live on the Jellicoe Road. Where trees make canopies over-head and where you can sit at the top of them and see forever.” 


 
Also, no matter how confusing the alternating chapters are, in the end the author brings them together and honestly breaks my heart in the process.I will not lie to you and tell you that it was easy reading this book. Taylor was annoying and selfish at times. She was standoffish most of the time and her ""devil may care"" attitude will get on your nerves once you start warming up to the side characters. You may think the story is slow, and yes, I won't lie. It is a pretty slow story. However once the manuscript and Taylor's life intersect, that's when I was passing the pages as fast as I could.I formed an emotional attachment to everyone in this book (yes, even Taylor once I got to know her). I sighed and swooned over Jonah Griggs and the Brigadier. I cried my eyes out while following Taylor on this journey.I think that this is one of those books that it is perfectly acceptable to re-read if you had a bad relationship with it at first. You’ll be sure to fall in love with it.Overall, while it had a shaky start and a questionable main character, this book presents two stories and brings them together in a very poetic and feel-inducing way. It’s a book I’d re-read any day.",4,default,"['2014-tbr-challenge', 'in-library', 'ugly-crying-was-involved', 'wishlist']"

Jellicoe Road
 for me was a 420-Page Fail. I never got into it, and I’d put it down for a day or two at a time, but I just couldn’t abandon it. It had plots, character and dialogue, like I like. It was like the equivalent of a reading experience, almost just like reading something you like. It was the GED of reading experiences.And the whole time, there was a voice in my head saying, You’re supposed to love this book. A bunch of your Goodreads friends loved this book.

I mean, A Taste of Honey won the Best New Artist Grammy in 1979, and you celebrate their entire catalogue!Maybe that guilt of You Should Be Loving This, You Almost Love This, Right? is what caused me to finish it, but there was also the suspense element of, If You Hang In There, The Plot’s Gonna Come Together And Make Sense. It did eventually make sense, but in an underwhelming way.Maybe the bottom line is, I didn’t have enough estrogen in my body to indulge in the maudlin-cryfest energy that apparently makes this book so compelling.

Like about the territory wars. But most especially on why are you feeling these things, Taylor, I don't get them. Like can you give me time to adjust, please?

“What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.”
When I started Jellicoe Road, I was beyond confused. I don't think I've been that confused since I read The Maze Runner for the first time when I was too young to understand what the heck was going on. The author just throws you into this weird menagerie of terminology and switching back and forth between italicized and regular (as regular as this book can get) chapters. I didn't start really understanding this book until two hundred pages in, which is almost half way.Although I was left confused for almost 50% of this book, I am still giving this book four stars for a couple reasons:1) It's the best I've read by Marchetta. I have to give it a better rating than the other ratings I've given her books because of that sole fact. I've read both Saving Francesca and The Piper's Son, and neither of them blew me away despite their high Goodreads ratings. I found the prior to be boring, depressing, and I just felt very disconnected from the book as a whole. The latter was a little more interesting, but it still felt a little long for the lackluster plot, and the disconnect was still there. This one was different from those two because this one is a mystery instead of just a contemporary about realistic issues. Mysteries are some of my favorite books out there, so I definitely feel like that's part of the reason that this one was more enjoyable for me.2) The ending really comes together. It's really impressive how the two stories are brought together and everything is connected. It's obvious that Marchetta put a lot of thought and work into forming this story. It definitely takes some time to put two and two together, but I would strongly suggest not DNFing this book because the ending really saves the book and brought this book up from two stars to four stars.3) Taylor's character. Actually all of the characters were so genuine, and I felt for them all. I didn't feel much of anything for her characters I've read about before. I really connected with how Taylor felt the most though. Not in the sense that her mother left her when she was eleven or her going to a school for delinquents, but in how she viewed the world around her.
""So explain to me again what I did wrong.""I don't stop. ""You know what? You didn't do anything wrong. I did. It's this dumb thing I do. I look into things ad see more than I'm supposed to.
I really liked her character, but I also liked the relationships between them. Raffy and Taylor's friendship was adorable, and I loved how Raffy always had faith in Taylor's authority even when she didn't agree with her. I didn't love Jonah Griggs as much as all of the other people on Goodreads, but the part where Griggs reveals what he was planning to do at the train station really broke my heart and formed a soft spot inside of me for him. 4) Unique story. You all know I'm a sucker for anything that I haven't read before, especially in YA. There are so many overused tropes and recycled ideas that I feel lucky when I stumble upon a story that is fresh and new. That is Jellicoe Road. As weird as it is, it's still refreshing and I loved trying to figure it out.If I had any complaints, I wish there would be a map of some sort that would clarify the territories of each faction. If there were a little more explanation of the whole situation at the beginning instead of just capitalizing words and confusing the reader into probably setting this book down (which I might have done if I didn't have a thing against DNFing). Other than the confusion on top of confusion, I think this book is those who are tired of the same old in YA should definitely pick up. It will definitely blow your mind when everything begins to come together.",3,default,"['read-2016', 'mystery-thriller-suspense', 'revisit']"

“And life goes on, which seems kind of strange and cruel when you’re watching someone die.”
Throughout the story I’m thinking that this novel is what happens when you combine Veronica Roth, Gillian Flynn, John Green, Sarah Dessen, and Melina Marchetta’s novels. The territory wars and the factions seems like the divergent series. The mystery in the story may seem like that of Gillian Flynn and John Green’s. The family issues seems to come from Sarah Dessen’s . If I weren’t so keen as to observe the publication date I would have thought that Ms. Marchetta was inspired by the aforementioned writers in writing this story.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The story is a bit of a chaos at first. I was inexplicably confused. I have asked myself so many times, ‘are they still on earth?’, 'Is this another version of the Divergent series?' The story was totally confusing at first. Then, I was glad I found my bearings after three to four chapters. I tried so hard to understand Taylor’s explanation of what’s going on with her life. The past (the stories that Hannah wrote) and the dream that Taylor’s always having are additional confusion to the story. I even skipped some of it just to get to the story further which actually not a good idea if you really want to solve the mystery yourself. And I suggest you do that because that’s the thrill. I think that’s the reason why the author wrote it that way. You should attempt to solve the mystery for your reading to be more exciting. But to be honest, what hooked me to the story was the romance building between Taylor and Jonah. They’re supposed to be enemies! But somehow they’ve got history, which is one of the interesting parts in the story.That’s what heightened my interest on the story.Unfortunately, I wasn’t very thrilled with the mystery part. I hated that some people stick to their misery even if their loved ones are being dragged to it. It’s like selfishness. If they just told Taylor everything about her life, things wouldn’t have been so difficult for her. Why is it that some people choose to hide things from someone even though they know that person will always find ways to know what lies behind the mask and the deafening silence or the things left untold? They’re just making things difficult for everyone. Sometimes, while I was reading this, I wish this book is just about fighting territories between the factions. But now I'm thinking that I'm silly for thinking that. 'Cause I know it would be boring.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The book has left me pondering how some parents make decision in life that put their child's life into a mess. Some people blame their parents for their misery but as some humans are ever so curious as to why they have that kind of life, they find ways to trace the paths back to their past. It seems silly because they don’t know what they’re really looking for but their lives won’t ever be complete unless they found the answers they so eager to find. What’s a relief, is when they found out that their parents have made the right decision for them. There’s no regret in here because,we can’t change the past. Past is past and moving on seems to be the right decision. But as they say, until we make peace with our past, the future seems to be a blur.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Rating: 3 confusing stars  -because I used the word 'confuse' and its other form 3x...

'Jellicoe Road' is another book I look back on with not much fondness, and I am no longer comfortable with it being on my bookshelf. Maybe I think it's pretentious, overly contrived and melodramatic (ironic, since there isn't much of a plot to speak of, or remember, and why you should care.) Melodramatic yet detached from the characters' emotions and situations. Cynical yet silly, now there's a paradox. The book is not even magical realism, but it reads like it. Like, the main character is psychic, and has prophetic dreams? And dreams of what happened when she was little more than a baby, and before she was born - dreams of meeting people who died before she was born, but she knows them so well - what? Add in the fact that, for her seemingly perfect memory, even of traumatic events, she has repressed memories of things that are convenient for the book's weak mystery ""plot"" to work.I'll never forgive the line of dialogue about Anne Frank: ""The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying."" THIS IS SAID ABOUT A HOLOCAUST VICTIM. A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HOLOCAUST VICTIM. Even though it's said by a teenage boy, he isn't called out on it. It's sexist, and in incredible bad taste. It's vile. Most of the characters are unlikable, and all of the adults, as I've said before, are crap, even for YA.So, unable to defend it now, and in spite of its popularity and high praise, I wipe my hands clean of 'Jellicoe Road' for good. Perhaps it's overrated, not that great, or it hasn't aged well. The same could be said for most if not all of Melina Marchetta's YA novels.Original review:Right. Here goes nothing:'Jellicoe Road' has soooo much hype surrounding it, and for good reason. Even though I'd read a lot of positive Goodreads reviews before picking it up and reading, I kept my expectations fairly low. It still surprised me.'Jellicoe Road' is a fantastic and fascinating novel, full of memorable and distinctive characters and scenes - an enriching mixture that just makes you choke up. Like with nearly all books by Melina Marchetta, it has quotable passages and lines of dialogue on almost every page, and they're poignant and beautiful. How Ms Marchetta comes up with all of these life philosophies, I don't know. And it amazes me. I think I love the setting the most, which is a boarding school in the woods, like a summer camp only secretly full of brutal teens fighting and kidnapping each other for territory purposes. And there's a ""Prayer Tree"". Treehouses are adorable!It is certainly not your typical YA romance story either. There's much more depth to it than that.However... It's not perfect. I'll try listing the things I didn't like about this novel:1. The adults are crap. Really, there's no other word to describe them. Yes, I understand why they're crap - tragic childhood and never learning to grow up emotionally - but the decisions they make don't make sense to me. I won't reveal what those decisions are due to spoilers, but it has something to do with a pet-peeve I have about adult guardians keeping important secrets from their kids for no good reason. Emotional scarring or not, if you love and trust your children then they have a right to know the truth. Knowing nothing will most likely hurt and confuse them more than knowing something. The secret-keeping is there to add mystery to the plot, but most of the mysteries are rather obvious anyway and I found them to be a little too contrived, even with the emotional backing.2. Some characters had to grow on me long into the story before I could like them, such as Jonas Griggs and Taylor, believe it or not. But I liked characters such as little Jessa, Raffy and the tragedy-stricken but playful kids in flashbacks. Taylor I found to be too aggressive and selfish from the first chapter, but once I grasped her takes-no-shit ways (and she truly doesn't take any shit), and her unconscious desperation to know who she is and why her mother abandoned her on Jellicoe Road, I found her hard not to love and respect as a protagonist. Her life sucks, and she adapts to it by the only means she knows how (especially with irresponsible and thoughtless adults around making it worse).3. Santangelo's comment about Anne Frank on page 216 of my copy: ""The girl never kept her mouth shut, she was bloody annoying."" (I wonder if he'd say that if Anne Frank had been a boy. I doubt it.) But I'm sure this is somehow a compliment in context to the conversation he's having with Taylor and the Jellicoe gang, as he then says, ""it was like nothing could kill what was inside of her"". The character interactions in this book feel realistic and help shape the setting, by the way.4. The ending, while dramatic, is contrived. It is a pay-off of sorts to something only mentioned a few times throughout the book, and it didn't quite work for me. But it didn't turn out too badly. Because the next, not-so-theatrical pay-off - and climax - is a heart-wrenching conclusion to Taylor's story about self-discovery and what it means to have people around who love her.I could talk more about of the contrivances in the story, whether or not they are spoilery. However I do not want to put anybody off reading this novel, despite a few minor issues I had with it that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5.And I do feel bad about not giving 'Jellicoe Road' 5 stars, because it did have a profound effect on me emotionally and mentally, and Ms Marchetta is a genius. I guess the number of things that annoyed me were one too many.But I do really, really like it. It's a beautiful, wondrous story about maturity, family, friendship, the importance of memories and childhood, and the strength to change. It's a puzzle of a coming-of-age tale about one unique teen, Taylor Markham. The other characters and their lives are also unique, and add substance to the plot and the way it's structured. Imperfect people make up the heart of the story of 'Jellicoe Road', melodramatic or no.'Jellicoe Road' is one of those books that leaves you feeling so much that you don't know what to do after finishing it. It is tender-hearted despite its dark themes, and it is as funny as it is sad and shocking. Ms Marchetta has a gift of making you emotional from reading her writing, regardless of the premise or content. It may not be my number one favourite book of hers (which is still 'Finnikin of the Rock') - like it is for so many other readers - but there is definitely something special in this. I overall enjoyed the journey on the Jellicoe Road.Final Score: 4/5",2,default,"['young-adult', 'romance', 'tear-jerker', 'mysticism-of-life', 'mystery', 'gritty']"

The premise of this story isn't established as effectively as it could have been. There's a good chunk of the book in which very little is explained, or is not explained well.For me, this book's biggest downfall is that, while the events of the story make dramatic sense in building the plot up to the climax and all of that, they weren't necessarily ""full-proof."" What I mean by that is that this story has a lot of potential for plotholes. Many things are left unsaid, and many things the reader may believe he or she understands are disregarded often.The main character, Taylor, was (obviously) the most well-written character of the bunch, and I sympathized with her struggle to understand where she belonged and why her mother abandoned her. She was what pulled me through the story, because I wanted to go on this emotional journey with her and understand her life alongside her. However, many of the side characters fell flat for the sake of that journey, I felt. I didn't understand the basis for her relationship with Jonah Griggs, and I was left unmoved by their consequent romance (which felt a tad rushed, despite having some backstory). Rather, earning about Taylor's past, and the way it's revealed bit by bit, is what makes this book memorable, not necessarily the characters themselves or their friendships. This is almost a book that you need to read twice to fully appreciate. And while I can respect that, and while I'm in awe of how the second half wholly changes the story entirely, knowing that this book practically demands two readings makes me feel a bit cheated as a reader. Had the premise(s) been better established, I think that readers would be able to get the full potential of this book with just one read-through.That being said, I really adored the latter half of this book. Melina Marchetta wrote with emotion and clear purpose, and I think it paid off in the end. I did enjoy following Taylor's story, and the way all the puzzle pieces fit together and how everything unfolded is something that I won't soon forget. Even though some aspects of this story could've been crafted better, I still really liked this book by the end and I eagerly look forward to reading more of Marchetta's contemporary work.",2,default,['library']

I was later told that it took half the book to really hook the reader, and that it ended up being worth it.It's...kind of worth it? I...I guess?The book has an arresting first sentence and intriguing prologue that describes a car accident...and then it moves forward twenty-two years to a teenage girl named Taylor who was not in the prologue, and she's in a weird school in Australia, and there are territory wars between Cadets and Townies, and I don't know what the fuck is going on.We get more flashes of the characters in the prologue. How are they connected to the present-day action? WHO KNOWS.Taylor is a perfectly likable character, but she definitely does not care whether the reader understands what's going on, especially because she doesn't know some of it. She makes references to various events in her past, but her own past is mysterious to her. She has weird dreams about a boy in a tree, she doesn't know her mother or father, she...there is just a lot of mystery here.The problem is that I was given almost no grounding to care about anyone or anything beyond wanting to know what was going on. The territory wars baffled me, making me think this was a dystopian, post-apocalyptic world (spoilers, it's not), and I couldn't connect to most of the characters.Halfway through the book—and I mean almost literally at the 50% mark—information is revealed that helped me recontextualize the narrative and understand what was going on. As Taylor discovers more about her past, I was certainly more engaged, but even then, Melina Marchetta's writing style may not be my thing, as dramatic revelations sometimes went uncommented on, and I still didn't really care so much about the characters. I had a lot of questions about the setup, about why characters acted a certain way and didn't tell people certain things. I liked elements of the ending, though.I should like this book more than I do. I admire the narrative structure, but it does ask a lot of the reader. It's an incredibly frustrating read for half the book, and while I enjoyed the various reveals, they don't quite make up for the first half.

On the Jellicoe Road is not your typical young adult fiction, especially in terms of the story telling. That said, this novel may not be for everyone. The beginning was confusing although I don't doubt that the intention was to build up the mystery. But I'm the type of reader who likes a good old solid start to get me thoroughly invested, and sadly, my interest waned by the time the story came together.Melina Marchetta is actually one of my favorite authors, she excels both in YA fiction and fantasy and I find her writing style very clever and her characters are always interesting so I very rarely dislike her work. I did not hate this one but the characters didn't stick with me and in my case, that's a deal breaker. There was one scene though in this story that stuck with me, it came as a shock even. First I have to confess, I'm a little slow on predicting the big reveal most of the time, embarrassingly enough.

It’s just not my cup of tea although I do read books from these genre occasionally. What can I say about Jellicoe Road? It is a story of friendship, love and hope. It is a good and inspiring story. And quite engaging too especially at the second half of the book. I love the friendship from the two generations depicted in the story. In fact, I envy that kind of friendship. I longed for someone who will stick with you through thick and thin. A friendship that you know will last forever - no matter what happens. The first half of the book is confusing and frustrating. The story building doesn’t make any sense; it was slow and Taylor was annoying. It was boring and I almost DNFed it. At this point, I advise you not to. Just hold on to it because everything will be explained as the story progresses. The romance is sweet and true. I like the chemistry of Taylor and Jonah; Raffy and Chaz. I can’t help but smile when they’re together. The rest of the cast are quite good too. Raffy and Ben are so funny especially when they were teasing Taylor and Jonah. I think this is the point when I started enjoying this book. The funny bits and romantic scene kept me going until the end. The mystery about Taylor’s past is intriguing but predictable. I already know what will happen next and the huge issue from the past. The drama is just too cliche and I’ve seen this a lot in Pinoy drama series. It’s a sad, tragic story but it didn’t make me cry.

When she’s 17, her ‘substitute mother’ disappears. Taylor goes on a quest to find the missing adults in her life. At the same time, she has to lead an underground war against her biggest enemy – who she has a crush on.I had been warned that Jellicoe Road was confusing at first, but would then be extremely good once you figure things out. I guess I had expected more after this description. It just wasn’t my cup of tea, though. I liked reading about Taylor and how she would gradually put the pieces of the missing-parents-puzzle together.

I wanted to scream ‘GET A LIFE’ at these kids. And this took up a huge part of the book. I understand why this book is appealing to some.

I found this book a little airy, a little insubstantial. I could see the gossamer filaments of the story float past me and not snag.

They draw me out of myself and make me feel. But when I read this, I was already there.

But recently Hannah has gone missing without so much as a goodbye, and Taylor is starting to suspect there's information about her past that people aren't telling her.I hadn't read any Marchetta before this book, and I'm unsure if this is her typical writing style, but it was difficult for me to follow. Marchetta doesn't spell things out of you. The story changes pace, setting, and characters frequently and without warning.Without knowing much about this book beforehand, I jumped right in, and I wasn't quite sure what I found. The territory wars seemed borderline fantasy, and Marchetta leaves the objectives and what's at stake a little vague. Is this a real war? Are these kids really fighting for their lives?You're introduced to many, many characters almost immediately and some who go by multiple names. The story alternates following two similar groups of friends -- one in present day (Taylor) and one generations before. The connection between the two, and who exactly these people are, is part of the mystery.I will admit my personal experience with this book was a confused one. It's compelling and disjointed. I often had to flip back and read a page again to be sure I wasn't missing something only to discover that I hadn't missed anything at all -- Marchetta intentionally plants question after question within each chapter.You're surprisingly exposed to multiple layers within many characters despite there being very little time dedicated to them. For those of you turned off by the typical YA romance, you may want to give this one a shot. These teens face real difficulty and you, as the reader, can't help but get invested and root for them the whole way.",0,default,[]

And before I started I did something different as well; I’ve read a lot of reviews, most of them were pointing out to have patience because the beginning is dizzy, disjointed and with too many characters which are categorised into boarders, townies and cadets.But I didn't have that big of a problem with the beginning although I was slightly annoyed because I am very ''cautious'' with YA books – especially those that have high ratings, which this one definitely has.Because I so often switch from genre to genre I give myself a right to be a sheriff and a judge in my own bookhood. I like to swoon over something and instead of being infatuated I end up being disoriented in my disbelief. I became very harsh with books – because just reading something to read, that cannot be applied to my mouth watering yearn and long lasting love affair that I will have with books till.the.end.of.my.time.la.la.la.la. So it’s not the plot that slowed my reading down, but the sentences of this book were to blame. I instantly started liking Marchetta's way of expressing herself and there was this ironical attitude that Taylor had which attracted me further. I admire people with integrity who have an opinion. Without your opinion what are you left with that it counts? She writes in a way where you can see the end. Meaning, she tells a lot of things in one subject-verb-object-fullstop. Especially when he said: ''Go to hell.'' And she replied, ''Been there. Trust me, it's overrated.'' I can tell you it’s overrated as well, but I never thought of it in this simple way. That’s the reason why I loved this book. It was full of these short written gems that you heard before but you didn’t recognise them as life savers. But this book didn’t impress me how I wanted it. It had very strong moments and toward the end, I cried but what I’ve learned in my life is that tears are not the expression of sadness; complete retreat into yourself and blessed numbness are. Tears will help you a great deal, they wash you over and nurture you, but no, they will not tell you how one person feels. Taylor didn't cry that much, but it was heartbreaking to read how stoical she had to be, if not, she would shatter. So while I liked Taylor and her development, not just with Jonah Griggs but dealing with overwhelmingly sad beginning of her childhood – see, this is where this book lost me completely - history and present were just too separated. Her life, but just her current life was great to read about because it was senselessly sad but I was getting annoyed because everything was tied up in the end, and I wished that the whole book was like the last 50 pages. I didn’t like how clumsy antagonism between townies, cadets and boarders was described, and I sure didn’t like the entire mumble jumble that happened on the Jellicoe road twenty years ago. Not the result of it, or how people dealt with that excruciating story but how Memento and Irreversible (movies) it was written. I am not talking about how confused I felt, but how it wasn’t emotionally engaging as the present story was, which is a tough cookie because it could have been just it was entangled too much. On a higher scale, this book really deals with a lot of bad things – traumas of loss and abusiveness. And that makes me somehow indecisive because there are so many things that made me lull, that I found startling and touching, and then there were these whirls of shallowness, laziness and lightness, which I can't forgive this book.What I want to say is that Marchetta’s books are difficult to review. Yeah, I’ve written so much, but these are just words. Basic message is – read this book, in the end it will not disappoint you. Whoever you are, I guarantee you that you will find something that will be just yours because reading about happy people, where’s fun in that. Reading about broken people who found a way out, mmmmm, yes please. ",0,default,"['ya-and-creatures', 'east-and-aussie']"

I can’t make up my mind about it. Despite it being pitched it as a mystery and many users tagging it as a romance, it felt like neither to me. Imo this was a coming of age story about friendship and bonds that are forged at a young age and last forever.One thing’s for sure: Melina Marchetta’s writing is lyrical and beautiful and captivating. “I live on the Jellicoe Road. Where trees make canopies over-head and where you can sit at the top of them and see forever.” Now, as for the story … there are actually 2 stories being told: the ‘present’ story and the ‘past’ story, which elicited opposite reactions from me. (The connection between them was obvious to me as a reader from almost the beginning, but for the heroine from the present it takes a journey that lasts the whole book to figure out how her life is connected to those from the past.)- I wasn't much invested in the ‘present’ story, mostly because I had trouble connecting with its heroine, Taylor. Her story was sad and I felt bad for her but I didn't really feel her pain as I would have for someone I knew and cared about. I never figured out what made her tick: what was going through her head when she acted the way she acted? And what was up with her weird dreams? The love interest, Jonah, was kind of “in the shadows” and for most of the book their relationship was almost non-existing. I frankly didn't feel the Taylor/Jonah love. I liked the secondary characters Raff, Chaz, Ben and Jessa a lot more than I did the MCs, but once again, they seemed barely fleshed out. I guess what I want to say is that I felt like an outsider looking into their lives but not really being a part of it. - I also didn't buy the part of the plot about the territorial wars between Townies, Cadets and Jellicoe kids. There were a lot of threats and little action. They weren't doing anything other than saying “we are at war, don’t enter our turf” and it seemed like they didn't accomplish much. (But I must admit that the literal “shit fight” made me laugh.)+ The ‘past’ story on the other hand... WOW. Narnie, Webb, Tate, Fitz and Jude carved a path right into my heart and took permanent residence there. They made my heart ache with tremendous joy and unspeakable sadness.I cried my heart out and then cried some more. I was left feeling raw. I wanted to pull them all into a group hug and never let them go. Every tragedy they experienced I experienced as if it were my own. Their friendship, their mutual love, their bond, was all incredibly beautiful and heat-breaking. Nostalgic. Bittersweet. Melancholic. Everlasting. Memorable. And that ending! In a nutshell: two stories were told and interwoven in this book. One I was rather indifferent to; the other I was totally invested in and loved. I wish the people from the ‘past’ story had had more page time, or even had the book all to themselves and then I would surely had rated Jellicoe Road with 5 stars.Australian slang I picked up:*Gaol=jail*Pash= heavy duty kissing between teenagers/snog.",0,default,"['y-a', '2014-reads', 'contemporary', 'own-paper-copy', 'aussie-authors', 'cried-my-heart-out', 'epilogue-perfection', 'punch-to-the-feels', 'mixed-feelings']"

The pacing is pretty slow, but it builds on itself and reveals information and history about the characters, their relationships, and the world. The story grows and develops and blooms. It’s a weird one - I wouldn’t think much about it when I wasn’t reading, but when I was reading it had my full attention. 
Things I Liked
:I really liked the writing style. It was very much a stream of consciousness style that I found easy to read. It was easy to connect with Taylor because we get so much of her emotions and thoughts from the writing. I liked how we were discovering information alongside her. The story pulls you with it and keeps you engaged.I really loved the flashback scenes to Narnie, Tate, Jude, Fitz, and Webb. I found the characters endearing and very lively. They had such an earnest friendship and it was great to see. (view spoiler)[I also loved that Hannah’s book was about these flashback characters we meet and that the story was her story. The story of her and her friends, it paralleled Taylor, Griggs, Santangelo and the other characters beautifully (hide spoiler)] We get so much history from them. I loved seeing how their relationship changed the townies, the cadets, and the Jellicoe school kids.I also really loved the dynamic that developed between Griggs, Taylor, and Santangelo. As the chosen leaders of the cadets, the Jellicoe school houses, and the townies respectively, it was nice to see their interactions change and evolve over the course of the story. The learn more about each other and their history and they evolve naturally. I really loved the bonding at the Prayer tree, it felt so genuine that I became completely invested in these three characters.
Things I Didn’t Like
:I didn’t really care about Raffaela at all. She felt pretty useless as a character to me. I know she has some kind of history with Santangelo that was supposed to cause drama or at least bring her into the core group, but we don’t get any information to actually make me care. The side characters in general all receive virtually no information, but that’s really ok because the story is more about the core group and their history and the history of Jellicoe road. But Raffaela is integrated as part of the core group, but I don’t think we get enough of her to establish her on her own.The serial killer side plot fell completely flat to me. There wasn’t enough information to establish is and it didn’t have much closure either. It never went anywhere, it was just brought up now and again with no history or development. It was really just unnecessary and didn’t add anything at all to the story.This was an enjoyable and engaging read, that builds and creates this hazy world of nostalgia and mystery. I really liked how the answers revealed themselves naturally and organically. The characters and the world are ethereal, while still being incredible grounded in emotion and humility.",4,default,"['contemporary', 'standalones']"

El personaje principal me molestaba porque siempre tenía una actitud de todo me vale una mierda y constantemente estaba buscando una “razón” para alejarse de los que la querían y se preocupaban por ella porque sentía que no podía depender de nadie, la habían abandonado ya dos veces y no se creía capaz de soportar eso de nuevo. Creó una barrera entre ella y los demás, siempre aparentemente impenetrable. Me frustraba porque quería que abriera los ojos, que se diera cuenta que no estaba sola y que aunque había sufrido no todo podría ser tan malo… pero todo fue una ilusión, y más o menos cuando le quedaban unas cien páginas al libro, todo cambió. Y la entendí, sufrí por ella y con ella y me abrumó todo lo que se descubre en estas páginas. Entonces me agradó, pero no me podía olvidar de lo tedioso que fue soportarla anteriormente. ""Si quiero más, tengo que ir a buscarlo, exigirlo, abrazarlo con todas mis fuerzas y tratarlo de la mejor manera de la que soy capaz.""Me gustó porque Melina escribe precioso y me hizo sentir lo que leía, me hizo sufrir y me hizo lamentar que a veces la vida de unas personas tan buenas no vaya tan bien como se podría esperar. Fue tan abrumador que en ocasiones no quería continuar leyendo, porque sabía que se descubriría un hecho que me dolería saber. Todos mis no tiene sentido, es incoherente, parece más un juego que otra cosa… y demás dudas y críticas se vieron opacadas por tanto sentimiento. Mientras leía pase de pensar que se merecía una estrella por hacerme perder el tiempo a que se las merecía todas. Yo no le doy cinco por lo que dije, porque también lo odié y me hizo muy mal aunque sea una novela espectacularCreo que se merece una oportunidad porque pasa de ser absurdo e ilógico a ser bonito y esperanzador. Me molestaron muchas cosas, pero al final creo que fueron más los pros que los contras.

I haven't actually read a Melina Marchetta since Looking for Alibrandi in Highschool. I loved Looking for Alibrandi. It got me through many difficult, angsty 16 year old times. Had I read Jellicoe Road in High School, I feel I would have loved it just as much.Because the thing is - Taylor is a really great main character. She's a rough around the edges, but damaged, needy girl who is able to pull out her strength when she needs it. All she realls wants is to love and be loved. The story is centred around Taylor's search for her mentor, Hannah, who has disappeared in the middle of the night to ""care for a friend"". Taylor has reason to believe that isn't true and is concerned for Hannah's safety.In the middle of the search for Hannah is the ""war"" - the school is divided up into various factions, and they have battled for years, distributing various areas of the school to the diffrent factions based on the outcomes of strategy and negotiation. People from other factions aren't really supposed to be friends, but there is definitely some emotion going on between Taylor and Jonah Griggs (who may I add, is a bit yummy.)As well as all of these concepts, the chapters are interspersed with the manuscript that Hannah is writing about 5 friends on the Jellicoe Road. And these 5 friends are starting to feel awfully familiar to Taylor.Right so - Marchetta certainly knows how to write a believeable love story. I loved Josie & Jacob in looking for Alibrandi, and I certainly loved Taylor Markham and Jonah Griggs. There is something so raw and real about them. It isn't all sunshine and lollipops - they are both seriously flawed characters who manage to bring out the best in each other.I read the book fairly quickly, because it was certainly very readable. There were a few times when I scratched my head and flicked back a few pages because I felt I had missed something, but it all came together in the end. As far as the story goes, it was pretty good. Not amazing, but I would certainly prefer to see teenagers reading this over something like Twilight. ",0,default,"['australian-reads', 'young-adult-children']"

I did not get anything, I did not like how it was written, I did not like the characters, I did not know where the characters were, who was named what and why certain things happened. But it was still quite capturing. It was a mystery. And the more you read the more you found out. I kept finding it flurry until I had read about half of the book. There I got more answers and I now knew the characters better and I understood them and that made me like them. The book still contained a whole lot of mystery and secrets. The other half of the book is the most exiting I think. You get a lot more clues, things get solved and romance becomes on of the big topics. And there I found myself totally captivated and unable to put the book down. I found the story both really lovely and sad.The romance in the book is so beautiful that it almost beats romance in other romance novels. The main character Taylor Markham is a 17 year old girl who lives at the Jellicoe boarding school. On the outside she seems very tough but underneath it all she is very fragile. She was abounded by her mother at fourteen and do not have an idea where her mother is now. The book is about looking for something you been missing and feeling empty and lost but then finding these things that makes you whole. I did not know if I really liked the book when I stated reading it cause it was just so unclear. But when I had finished it and everything made sense and I got a closure of the story I found myself loving everything about it. I recommend this book to anyone who would like a good, touching, can not put down kind of book. ",0,default,[]

Taylor Markham was abandoned at a gas station by her drug-addicted mother at age eleven. She is 17, lives in Jellicoe School, with many state wards and troubled children. She is in charge of her House of younger girls and is expected to lead an ongoing 'territory war' between the Jellicoe School kids. She battles with the 'Townies' and the Cadets. Her main source of parental guidance (Hannah) goes missing and she becomes emotionally distraught. The genre is mystery; however, the story line is more about the intense journey instead of solving unanswered questions. Within Jellicoe Road relationships are formed between the most different of people. Taylor’s house has been burnt down and in the ruins she finds the most love from the people she didn’t appreciate as much as she should have. After talking to her house mate Raffy, Taylor internally decides “to vow to keep Raffy around for the rest of (her) life.” This quote magnifies the love between friends and the safety net everyone forms with each other.Jellicoe road can be seen in many different ways, from the inside it is a competitive confusing place where trust is always at question. Although the houses negotiate for territory they know inside what is right and what belongs to whom. Often threatening each other, “Whatever is now covered up will be uncovered and every secret will be made known.” Within the Jellicoe system are people that know everything about each other yet now are in competition.",0,default,[]

That and the fact that I went to high school in an area where lots of the boys' schools have cadet corps, and I know what total asshats cadets can be. Really, it was only the fact that it had so many positive reviews from people I trust that kept me reading. The first hundred-odd pages was enormously confusing. I had no idea who the protagonist was, other than that her name was Taylor and that she attended a boarding school somewhere in rural New South Wales. Based on the fact that it's seven hours from Sydney, you go through Yass to get there and it's somewhere near the Murrumbidgee based on various names that crop up in the story, I'm going with somewhere around Hay, but that's just because I like to have some kind of sense of where things are set when I read Australian books. ANYWAY. It took a LONG time for the story to get going. Like, a third of the book kind of long time. Prior to that, there were ideas flying around everywhere, and overlapping stories, and I generally felt like my copy of the book was missing at least 50 pages of story and that I'd just been dumped in the middle. But I persevered, and it did get better. The overlapping stories came together beautifully, and I loved Taylor slowly discovering that not everything is the way she thinks it is. Some of the scenes were absolutely beautiful. I think it would have been a 4 star book for me if it hadn't taken so long for me to feel involved in the story.

It's a little bit hard to characterize this book as ""realistic,"" since it has a feeling of unreality both because the setting seems a bit implausible and the dreams are mystical, but it isn't a fantasy either. The setting is a rural boarding school (in Australia) apparently largely for troubled kids and orphans, where there is an annual battle for territory between the students of the school, the townies and the cadets from a military school that spend time camping nearby. Taylor Markham, who was abandoned by her mother years earlier, becomes the leader of the students in her last year at the school, and also is in charge of the care of all of the students in her house. Hannah, a woman who lives in an unfinished house by the river, has provided a refuge and support to Taylor since picking her up from the store where she was abandoned. But Hannah mysteriously disappears, leaving behind a sad and mysterious manuscript, just when Taylor feels she needs her most. When the cadets come, Jonah Griggs is their leader, and he and Taylor have an uncomfortable and confusing history. To further complicate the normal territorial wars, the townies' leader Santangelo, is a lifelong friend of Taylor's best friend at school, Rafaela.

Most of my friends who have read it loved it. Which goes to show what we all know, books don't affect all people the same. I can understand why people liked the book, but for me it was really slow in the beginning and I just wasn't getting it. I got the general idea that Taylor had been abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road. Hannah, the woman who found her and who has given her a home has now disappeared. Perhaps it is me but I had trouble figuring out the boarding school that Taylor is attending and just what this ""war"" these kids are conducting between ""Townies"", ""Cadets"" and the ""Houses"" was all about. I still don't really understand it. I made one error in reading this book, and this is advice for anyone who is going to read it. I did not pay enough attention to the story that Hannah had written and Taylor is reading a page or two at a time. I think I was too concerned with trying to figure out this world Taylor is living in and missed some details that later play a major part in the story. There is romance in this book between Taylor and Jonah and that part was nicely done. There is also a touch of the supernatural in Taylor's dreams when she loses consciousness. It's a mystery of sorts as this girl tries to figure out who everyone is and what part they played in her early life.

Yes, it does get better.The main problem is I couldn't picture what the setting and some characters looked like. It's my personal thing that I often struggle with, but some aspects never clicked. For example, the fact that there would be territory wars between the Cadets/Townies/Jellicoe students seemed unbelievable to me. And that all this would go unnoticed by the adults. It was easy to lose track of the characters like Anson Choi, Ben Cassidy, Mullet Brothers.... it seemed the only thing that defined them was their name and I found myself having to flip back and re-read pages multiple times just to be able to get a gist of what was going on. This jumbled-ness really irritated me in the beginning, especially with the pages of Hannah's story. Again, I emphasise my experience of the novel is shaped by my personal reading style - perhaps a difficulty in fully immersing myself into the story.Gripes over, I really did like the story. Very clever, well written and with strong endearing main characters that bind you to them. Examples of this are Taylor and Griggs.

When a book wins an award and the majority of reviewers gush about it, I feel like I should pay attention.The last half of the book almost redeems the first half. Almost.

I shouldn't have to work that hard to figure things out.The tone is realistic; I like that. The first person narration seems right. But the setting was... odd to say the least. They're in a boarding school but there's no actual school going on. Where are the teachers? Why are there territory wars with cadets and townies? (The turf wars had little or nothing to do with the meat of the story - why Taylor, the narrator, was abandoned as a child.) And why was every single main character broken? And why did the few adults in the book - all connected to the narrator by blood or by history - have to keep the secrets about the narrator's parents? I'm equivocating with a two star review. Frankly I'm growing weary of the star system. I would like to dispense with these stars because they say nothing really. Was it a quality book? Maybe. So many reviewers say it is the BEST book they EVER read. Okay, I believe them.

I did not really adore the main character, Taylor Markham, because I noticed throughout the book that she is not a very nice and joyful person to be around. This is because there were spots in the book where she was cruel to kids and through her actions, you could tell that she is a depressed and anxiety - prone girl. For example, Taylor was rudely sarcastic to Hannah, her mentor and guardian, ""I don't have wings, Hannah"" (Marchetta 21). It is not her fault that she is that way because her mom ditched her when she was only 11, and she only has one recollection of her father due to him dying when she was really young. I also feel that the author should have put more thought into the character development of Taylor so that readers can see how Taylor progresses throughout the book, since she was a major part of the book. I did especially like the territory war between the Townies and the Cadets. I thought this war brought a lot of captivation to the readers, since it is a subject that we have never experienced in other books. One thing that happened during the territory war: ""On the other side of the room of the Darling girls are surrounded by Cadets while the girls from Hastings House look on in total envy"" (Marchetta 294).",0,default,[]

In the beginning I found it very choppy and hard to follow. All of the characters felt disconnected, the narrator Taylor was a void for me - I couldn't figure out who she was and where she was coming from. As the story progresses the pieces start falling into place and everything starts making sense. While I can conceptually appreciate how the author structured the book to embody the experience and mindset of its narrator, I don't know if it is completely successful in practice. It definitely requires a measure of patience and perseverance on the part of the reader to stick with it long enough to be given sufficient information to start caring about the characters. I also found the ""story"" that is set in italic and interwoven with narrative a bit disorienting until it is made clear that is Hannah's story that Taylor is reading. While some of the mysteries took a while to completely untangle, I found that I was able to discern the true identities of most of the characters a long while before the revelations within the book. Even so, the way Taylor internalizes it manages to give it extra weight and intensity.By the end, I found that the story had exceeded my initial expectations.

I think if I had read this upon its release, I’d have enjoyed it more. Too many authors that have mimicked this format now, and it’s not as fresh as it once was. Griggs was the highlight of the book. I love a strong, steady hero, and he was he was solemn to boot. There was no reading between the lines with this guy; you knew what he wanted you to know. Unfortunately, I wasn’t a fan of Taylor. It was hard for me to tell what her motivations were, and there was a point where she crossed the line for me. She was never able to come back from that. The parallel story was much more interesting than the one being told in its entirety, and I thought that was detrimental to the overall book. The reason some of the secrets were kept from Taylor felt flimsy to me. It was predictable, and while there were some emotional parts, I was never able to fully connect with anyone in the book. I did, however, love Raffy and Santangelo’s cat and mouse game, and I wish we’d seen more of them. Simon also tugged at my heart strings, and I’d have loved there to be some sort of resolution there.

Even Griggs, who is the leader of the Cadet with his drill sergeant attitude, has a compassionate side that he shares with Taylor. That compassion is what helps Taylor as she goes in search to find her mother.

My biggest complaint though was the Jellicoe school. All of this crap is going on, kids actually getting kidnapped or physically injured in a fake war, and the teachers are conspicuously absent. Seriously, these are the WORST teachers in the world. The only person that even semi cares about these kids is Hannah, and she's gone for half the book.

I'm very conflicted on what to rate this book. It took me about 150 pages before I even started to pull together what was happening. It almost felt like I had started reading the second book in a series without reading the first one to understand what in the world was going on. I was so lost for the first 150 pages I was very close to giving up on reading it.Another big thing I didn't like was the language. This book is classified as a Young Adult book, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of the young people I know who are currently reading this level of books. The f-word was used so many times I lost count. Also there is some sex in the book (although not overly graphic).I did, in the end, enjoy the story.

I did start to figure out some twists early on, so there were little surprises, here, but the book has a lot going for it. The story centers on Taylor Markham, who, over the course of the summer faces a series of crises and revelations that answer her questions about who she is, who she came from, and where she is going.

A few things I liked: - Exceptionally well written. The writing style was intriguing. There were many connections and symbols. Fabulously well written.- The story delved into sobering societal issues. Not only drugs, homelessness, abandonment, and death, but also the cycle of abuse and addiction, how people handle trauma and grief and guilt, etc. - I like how the characters relied on each other and supported each other. They absolutely LOVED each other and trusted each other, like family.- I felt so deeply. I cried. I hurt. I ached. - I liked how the story unravels - revealing this connection and then that connection. With little twists and turns along the way. It was captivating.A few things that were hard for me: - If I had to use one word to describe this book it would be TURMOIL. There was so much emotional agony, chaos, damage, and trauma. It was tragic. There was still hope in the end, but if they were weighed against each other, the anguish/tragedy would outweigh the hope/joy in the book. That was hard for me. Yes, it had a happy ending but, ugh, it was so sad...- I'm not a huge fan of prickly, harsh heroines like Taylor. (Regardless of what made them that way, although that knowledge definitely helps me have patience for them.)- A few aspects of the book, although they were necessary for the plot, were unrealistic. Would Hannah really abide by (view spoiler)[Tate's request that she (Hannah) never treat Taylor like a mother would?  (hide spoiler)] That was just stupid that Hannah always kept Taylor at an arm's distance, never filling her need to be loved and nurtured, just to comply with a (view spoiler)[ drug addict's selfish request.  (hide spoiler)] True love dictates that she would raise Taylor differently. It just doesn't jive with what we know about Hannah. Also, why would Hannah keep Taylor's heritage a secret? Not tell Taylor that (view spoiler)[ she was her aunt  (hide spoiler)], that she loved Taylor and would always be there for her? Taylor was so lost and confused, and dealt with major abandonment issues. How could Hannah, who is supposed to love her so deeply, keep her in the dark and watch her flounder that way? Taylor was a tormented girl because she had NO CLUE what her story was. Sad, so sad! It was so wrong of Hannah. I don't care (view spoiler)[ what Taylor's messed up mom wanted. Tate relinquished the right to be the only mother figure for Taylor when she made the life choices she made.  (hide spoiler)] Why make Taylor suffer so? Just allow the girl to know that someone loves her for heaven's sake!- It was so sad that (view spoiler)[ Tate could not stay strong and live for her daughter.  (hide spoiler)] She dealt with her grief in such a tragic, destructive way. - I was disappointed that (view spoiler)[ Tate and Jude  (hide spoiler)] had sex when they were overcome with grief, sadness, and loneliness and were seeking relief. That is not what sex is about. It's not a way to forget. It's a way to draw closer and express love to a committed partner. That's not how it felt, though. And it was even worse when (view spoiler)[ Taylor and Jonah  (hide spoiler)] had sex. They were emotionally and physically exhausted, processing post-traumatic stress, and seeking acceptance and relief in each other. Before that, they were just starting to experiment with being with each other on friendly terms. They were just teenagers and only starting on the journey of knowing who they were and growing into themselves. They weren't mature enough for a sexual relationship. They had had a rocky, raw, harsh relationship that was just starting to have a tiny hint of sweetness, but it was still frail and suddenly having sex out of a response to emotional strain was not cool. There was just something so wrong about it. Their relationship needed to be based on mutual attraction, affection, trust, and support, and yet sometimes I felt like they were drawn together because of mutual anguish and dependency. (As an aside, I can't help but compare this to the similar situation in A Different Blue by Amy Harmon, which was handled SO MUCH better because the characters showed restraint when they knew they were under emotional strain. It was a great book, by the way.) I did not like the scene when she yells at him saying in essence, she hopes she never sees him again, and he gets in her face, livid, and says ""I'm about this close to telling you to get the @#$% out of my life"" (chapter 17, page 252). It was scary and it made me realize that they aren't really in love as much as they have a dependency on each other (this sentence doesn't even address the fact that they were teenagers, and were clearly not mature enough to know what true love looks like). Again, later on, he made a very telling remark about why he was drawn to her; I don't recall it exactly- he might have said it in frustration- but it was disturbing because it wasn't what love should be. It was the instance when she answered sarcastically, ""How romantic,"" and I think that night they had sex. Yuck. The ""romance"" in this book wasn't romantic as much as it was raw. - There were a bunch of f-words. Maybe like 10 or so? And two instances of teen sex as I mentioned above. Although I liked the story, it was a heavier book than I usually read.",0,default,[]

There's no denying she has a superb command of language, endless creativity, and the ability to rip your heart out and stomp it to pieces. When I read glowing reviews for OTJR by some of my favorite bloggers, I knew I had to read it. One click on Audible and I was suddenly whisked away to the Australian outback.  So what exactly is this book about?? ~shrugs~ No review really gave much of a synopsis. A lot of posts read ""You just have to experience the plot for yourself!"" Strike one. Apparently the story is about young Taylor Markham, abandoned by her mother in a gas station when she was 11, and how she has found herself plunked down at the Jellicoe boarding school. There's also something about territory wars between her school and a couple other groups of kids, and then at one point her caretaker goes missing and Taylor tries to find her. But knowing Marchetta, there's a lot more going on to the story. There's also poignant stories of friendship, love, loss...ya know...typical YA standards. So why don't I love this story like I did Finnikin? Same themes, same drama and tragedy. For one, the book starts out insanely confusing, and then you get pieces of the puzzle in a stylish attempt to create mystery and intrigue in the story. Strike two. I was too confused to enjoy the subtleties. For another, I just didn't love the characters the same way. Other than Taylor and Griggs, the characters seemed so flat and two dimensional. It was hard for me to really allow Marchetta to rip on my heartstrings when really I just didn't care. But that could be more of a reflection on my heartlessness than her writing. And finally, I just didn't like the protagonist. Strike three. She came off as selfish and whiny, and darn it if she wasn't crying every other chapter. She was uncaring to her friends, completely self-absorbed, and not always the brightest crayon in the box. And maybe some people like that kind of protagonist. She definitely came across as human, emotional, and genuinely teenager-ish. Full marks to Marchetta for nailing that characterization. I guess I just wanted someone to root for more. But dang. Marchetta is flawless with words. Her narratives read like poetry. Her stories are real and honest. I would definitely recommend reading this one before moving on to her trilogy. I think she has since become a much more polished writer. So while this wasn't my favorite read of the year, I'm glad I gave Jellicoe a chance (if nothing else I truly enjoyed the narrator's Australian accent). ",0,default,[]

It seems true when she says it: she's 17 and has been at the Jellicoe School for years, and now she's ""the one-in-charge"" in the Territory Wars that happen for six weeks, in which students from her school face off against local kids (the Townies) and boys from a Sydney military school (the Cadets). The Jellicoe School is pretty much home for Taylor, though she also has lived in a nearby house that belongs to a woman in her early 30s named Hannah, who's been taking care of Taylor since her drug-addicted mom abandoned her in a 7-11 bathroom when Taylor was eleven. But Taylor's story isn't the only one we get: there's also a story from decades before that starts with a car crash on Jellicoe Road: we quickly learn that this other story is a book that Hannah's writing, but Taylor wonders if it's more than that, too. At the start of the book, I found the dual narratives somewhat off-putting, and had a hard time getting into the book generally: it felt like there was a lot going on and it didn't all flow together, and I wasn't really into some of the moments of magical realism. But by the end, I was sitting on my couch in tears, so I'd say Jellicoe Road won me over, magical realism and all. What makes the book work for me, mostly, is Taylor, and how she grows over the course of it. She's so closed-off when the book starts (understandably, given her childhood): she has a hard time trusting people and tells herself she isn't particularly interested in changing that. But of course that isn't totally true, and on some level she knows it. I like how we get to see Taylor becoming friends with other kids from her school, and becoming close to the leaders of the Townies and the Cadets as well (especially the leader of the Cadets, a kid named Jonah she knows from a few years back). And I like how we get to see her learning more about Hannah and her mom and the other kids who were part of their close-knit circle of friends, back when they were kids and teenagers, and how she starts to understand some things about why her mother has done the things she's done.

This book wasn't bad by any means, but I had a few issues with the book. Some were reasonably wrapped up by the end, but it fully took me half the book before I felt invested in the outcome and I still felt annoyed by some things:1. I expected more fun hijinks and pranks in the territory war, but instead I found myself genuinely fearing for the safety of these children.2. It kinda felt like I was reading a sequel or companion to some other novel, and that even if the story wasn't really dependent on this imagined other book, I was lacking an understanding of the world - not just the Australian references, but events and relationships and context for the school. Again, a lot did get filled in as the story unfolded, but so much of the book just felt like unconnected pieces floating around.3. I don't think any of the adults have a valid reason to justify hiding so much information from Taylor in the way that they did, and I think she should have been more angry with them. Obviously, she has some spotted memories due some really traumatic childhood experiences, and much of the story was her discovering the connection between the past and present...but there were some needlessly massive gaps in her history. And given that that knowledge affected a lot more than just her, it's very difficult for me to reconcile.Ultimately, I just don't think this the right book for me at this moment time.

The writing in this was lovely, but I had no idea what was going on most of the time. The Territory Wars at first seemed Hunger Games level serious to me, given the bodily damage and very real consequences, but then they just...stopped? For no reason? They were never really explained. So much wasn't explained. What was the point of the Wars? What was the point of the three differently aligned groups? I also exactly predicted the identities/truth behind Hannah's story and who Tate, Narnie, Webb, Jude and Fitz were. That was frustrating. I struggled with likability of the characters as well. They were just too intense, and normally I love intensity. I couldn't stand Tate. THERE, I SAID IT.But again, the writing was beautiful. Just...Minus 1 star for the near total lack of world-building. This was a convoluted mess of solidity in terms of what was happening and why. So...you're telling me these kids lost their parents and just...drifted in the Australian outback? There were no adults or care services brought in to that situation? I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to fully accept that. But, again, nothing was fleshed out in terms of building blocks of their realities, so who actually knows.Minus 0.5 star for the intensity of the romances (view spoiler)[ both present day with Griggs and Taylor, and in the past, with the other 5 (hide spoiler)] at such young ages. It felt cloying and unbelievable most of the time.Minus 0.5 star for edging on torture porn levels of dramatic things occurring in/around Taylor's life.Minus 0.5 star for predictability and closeness of ideas.

My heart naturally goes out to each of these characters and Marchetta paints a very intricate, raw, and beautiful picture of life in its purity and ugliness. It is truly fascinating.The one problem I had with the novel (and this was a pretty big problem since it essentially resulted in the novel getting bumped down two stars) was that I was 75% confused for the first half of the novel and 25% confused until the end. Like honestly, the original 5 have the following names: Tate, Narnie, Webb, Jude, and Fitz. Now, guess which ones are girls? Maybe it's just me, but it was so hard for me to understand the relationship between the original 5 (I had to search it up on Schmoop to understand) and the short snippets of their stories in completely randomized order twisted my mind upside down in its head. (For my question, the first two, Tate and Narnie, are the girls and this didn't really make sense to me because I had just read a novel with a female lead named Jude and I only found this out after reading 30% of the novel.)But otherwise, the close bonds between characters as they find a family where they never had one is truly inspiring.

It is full of pieces that don't fit together to explain what happened to her father and why her mother abandoned her at the 7-11 on Jellicoe Road six years earlier. She is now a boarder at Jellicoe School. Taylor's puzzle pieces include a serial killer, a hermit, a scary brigadier general and an unfinished manuscript of a novel by Hannah, the woman who found her at the 7-11.I listened to On the Jellicoe Road and also found Taylor's story to be a puzzle. Neither her life at school nor her family situation made sense to me. It seemed that the book was one disagreement after another between various factions at her school over territory. I was confused and bored by the story. I pushed myself to continue listening since others found Taylor's story to be brilliant. Finally, as the audio book reached its last hour, the puzzle pieces started to come together and I began to understand what had been happening all along.Author Melina Marchetta never satisfactorily explained to me why there was so much secrecy about the whereabouts of Taylor's parents.Apparently, the print version of On the Jellicoe Road is titled Jellicoe Road.

Taylor is the leader of her school, the Townies, and she develops a romance with the leader of the other school, Jonah, called the Cadets. But, things take a turn after Taylor's guardian Hannah, who took her in after her mom abandoned her when she was eleven, disappears. Taylor finds out that her disappearance has to do with Taylor's mysterious past that her parents never told her about. Taylor reads Hannah's book in order to find clues about where she might be, and along the way she discovers secrets about her parents and the origin of the territory wars, and in the end she winds up finding much more than Hannah. I enjoyed this book, and I liked that as a reader I got to help discover Taylor's mystery alongside her, but I thought that the plot was a bit confusing because it jumped around so much, and some points were not as clear as they should have been.

Let me gather my thoughts first... not to mention extra time)Okay, I actually made a review of this, but this stupid GR box deleted it, so I kind of lost interest again. Tsk.Edit 12/8/13 Disclaimer: I'm doing this in between reading breaks so review might be a little sloppy but will try my best.To start with, let me just say that I'm a big Marchetta fan eversince Saving Francesca. That book I totally dig because it's one of those few YA books that reeks with realism while still avoiding sex (it was only referred, which is still good to me). And then Marchetta sealed the fangirl in me in The Piper's Son. Loved it beyond words.It is not the case with Jellicoe Road. Actually, while writing this, I am still struggling on how to rate this one. But seeing how there are books that I admittedly say few of the best that didn't even receive a 5-star from me, then my rating just suggests personal preference.On with the bad: Taylor Markham. Ugh. I can't believe I'm even considering this, but I think I hate her just as much as I hate Katniss Everdeen. Taylor got into my nerve several more times than I can count. The fact that I'm reading the book through her perspective makes it that much worse. I have never ever encountered a lead character with so much negativity in her body (okay, maybe I did, but right now Taylor outshines them all in the worst way possible) that it was a struggle to finish her POV. And everytime I finish a chapter, I feel like treating myself to a Thai massage parlor. She's the kind of girl I take pains to avoid in real life, as she is very, very toxic. She has this false self-entitlement of the worst kind, believing that she is worthy of all the happiness in the world and stomping her foot on everyone's feet when it isn't delivered to her on a silver platter. She constantly blames the people around her for her misery, is ungrateful to the friends who stick to her Just Because (I mean, I can't see why, as she is just a prickly nose-in-the-air), and has no regard for anybody else's comfort other than her own. You know those kind of people who treat people around them like crap? That's exactly what Taylor is. C'mon Taylor, get over yourself! The fact that people around Taylor stuck to her only meant that the world in Jellicoe Road is that small that they couldn't escape bumping into her so why bother, might as well try to develop a (false/forced?) friendship with her. And even though I love Jonah Griggs, I fail to see how someone like him would take up so much interest in her. I mean, Jonah, you a masochist?! There are better girls out there! Case in point: Raffy the best girl friend ever. I think it is totally unreasonable for someone to be attracted to an obvious broken douchebag. Why would anyone want to fall in love with Taylor? Unless, of course, Jonah also this false self-righteousness thingy going on about him which makes him think that he is a kind of Superman or something - but this is a totally different story so will not dwell on this. Thankfully of course, because Marchetta is a street magician who is able to pull a rabbit out of a sack cloth, she was able to straighten Taylor's repulsive character. By the last 30 pages or so, I was able to see the total change in her character, but by then, I didn't care anymore about her. I just want to see how the story would tie up. Taylor's annoying personality singlehandedly took the star out of what could potentially be a five.The less .5 star (see, I always start out a Marchetta with a full five) is for that stupid territory wars. I mean, my country lost hundreds and thousands of lives, sacrificed families and loved-ones, just to secure our independence from greedy colonizers for years, and then I find this little orange book taking it up as 'just a game.' The fact that the characters even take up the territory wars too seriously - negotiating to leaders like it was a matter of life and death for them - offends me even more. How privileged these little kids must have been that they can afford to start a war all on their own accord. Tsk. Why don't you just toss Taylor in the middle of a bomb drill while you're at it, so I can maybe find a bit of solace in this abominable insensitivity? Okaaay, enough of the bad. Moving on.I am still glad to inform Marchetta readers that Jellicoe Road has her trademark knife-in-the-gut. Even now, whenever I think of what happened to the friends, I feel this pain in my chest that traps my tears and keeps them from coming out so I won't ever find my peace ever again in my life. Even Taylor's existence wasn't enough to mask the wonder of how Marchetta was able to tie the stories together in the end. Honestly, after 130+ pages of Taylor's negativity and nothing happening aside from that stupid (I will not tire of saying this) territory wars, I kind of wanted to fly to the bookstore and demand a refund. Boy, was I glad to have stuck with it. That's Marchetta's magic, I think. That she's able to draw in you a kind of faith which will make you jump off a cliff and still believe that you will land on the realm of rainbows and marshmallows. And while I may have personal issues on the whole 'dependency' thingy, I still find the narrative punch-in-your-pained-soul. I won't post spoilers, but if you're into deep life-wrecking-life-changing friendships, Jellicoe Road is the book to read.Will recommend it? Definitely.

It’s my first experience with Marchetta, and I was hopeful to find another YA Australian author to add to my list of favorites. As a Printz winner and an often recommendation from several bloggers, I thought it stood a good chance of becoming a must read for me as well. Although I found this book hard to put down and I *liked* the story, I didn’t find it a homerun, I’m sorry to report.Taylor Markham has had a difficult life. As a child, she grew up in the home of a drug-addicted single mother who abandoned her at a gas station on Jellicoe Road. She was found by a woman named Hannah, with whom she has an often turbulent relationship, and ended up at the Jellicoe School. She finds it hard to relate to her fellow students and is taken by surprise when she is chosen to lead her classmates in a territory war with the Townies and Cadets that began so many years ago. Just as she is getting started in this new role, Hannah--the only family she’s ever really known--mysteriously disappears, leaving her anxious and questioning her whole existence. With her support system vanished, Taylor finds friendship in unlikely places, all the while piecing together an old story about a terrible accident which also resulted in unlikely friendships, ones that Taylor begins to suspect may have affected her life in ways that she can’t imagine.Marchetta is certainly a compelling writer, and I found myself very unable to put Jellicoe Road down. Let’s just say in the two days it took me to read this book, my toddler was watching a lot of Sesame Street and eating a lot of treats. If that alone could make a book for me, than Marchetta would have aced the test.I enjoyed the complexity of the stories, and the ways in which they converged. I think what Marchetta did best was to illustrate the need everyone has of family, of belonging, of knowing that someone somewhere loves you. That connection to the past, to your own origins, is so tantamount because it gives you a place to be rooted, and then you are free to grow, to change, to become what you want to. When terrible things happen, there must be an explanation, no matter how tragic or how hurtful, as to why. There is a certain peace and calm that comes with knowledge and understanding, especially of a person’s past. Without that, Taylor was just a wisp in the wind, unable to connect to anyone, to really care about life, to look past her own strange and concealed history.Marchetta’s characters do come off the page; they are very much alive and distinct. However, that they are realistic is not a compliment I can pay. I really tired of Taylor by the end. She is the type of character I rather dislike, in that she acts as if she can take care of herself but is completely unable, in every instance, to do so. Every bit of new truth set off either a health attack, a deep depression, or erratic and misdirected anger. Are these all normal emotions for someone who is faced with her kind of life? Perhaps, but it still bordered on a hysteria that gets old fast.I found Jonah to be equally as unbelieveable, but in the opposite way. He was the ever-stalwart caretaker, which I found to be a stretch for any normal person, certainly in the case of a teenage boy. Were there mitigating circumstances? Yes. But I think even taking those into consideration, it was just a little much. No relationship can stand when one person is always giving, the other always receiving. And Taylor needed all of what Jonah could give, and more. That all being said, I still felt both characters had depth. Although there was more than one instance of eye-rolling as I was reading their interactions, I’ve got to hand it to Marchetta. Notwithstanding, Taylor and Jonah and all the other inhabitants of Jellicoe were all memorable characters.Overall, an interesting and enjoyable story, but not one I feel devoted to. I don’t know that I would recommend this one. I think if it were to be made into a miniseries, “soap opera” would be the term to describe it. I simply didn’t feel the degree of reality and seriousness that I wish could have been there.www.makniks.blogspot.com",0,default,[]
1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1772481704,1772481704,2016-09-30,3,Krista,/user/show/52562506-krista," I need to reread this book because the author is talented AND so I know what is going on and not skip over details that turn out to be exteremely important later on. Here are my random thoughts in no particular order with minimal editing since I am on an iPad.-There was a lot going on, and some of it just seemed to be added for extra drama (the child porn and tunnel/fire storyline at the end of the book). -It seemed extreme that the cadets would stomp on a school kid's fingers, so for a while I was thinking that this was a dystopian book where there was an actual war going on. -The previous generation confused me until the very end and I could barely keep their identities and connections to the current generation straight. This sounds like a dumb problem, but I think that the names in this book added to my frustration. A character might be referred to as their last name for the majority of the book, and then be referred to by their first name every once in a while. This is fine in dialogue, but it just seemed weird that with Taylor would mentally observe Jonah as Griggs even after they become an item and she had been calling him Jonah. -speaking of Jonah, it is implied that he killed his dad then later confirmed. But what were the consequences? Was it self defense? Was he a cadet as a punishment? Was there ever an investigation?-The origins of the territory wars didn't seem to click with the modern day version. These five individuals created it because they are such great friends (but from what I noticed they barely spent any time with it), and then it somehow morphs into an intense 6 week long battle where much of the point is to not spend time with your friends on the other teams (even though they obviously do). More transitional history would have been helpful. I mean I guess I can see them having the time to do this, since apparently they had enough time to dig a secret tunnel too.-Taylor sees a photo of the previous gen characters, and from this she can identify everyone EXCEPT Jude? The guy she has seen the most recently? Also there is a lot of repression, which I admit I am probably not familiar with(who knows, I might have repressed a lot of my life and not know it). It seems weird that she could have told one of her housemates that she was left alone with a sex offender and then repress it so that the other girl is her secret keeper, even from herself. She also repressed her happy memories with Hannah and Jude which just seemed convenient. Also why is Jude breaking a window to Hannah's house to get the manuscript?-I know I am not the first person to not grasp that Fitz killed Webb until it is brought up at the very end about being able to forgive Fitz. I know I am not the only one to be confused because Google auto filled my search for me after I typed in ""who killed Webb"" to add in the book title. I admit I skimmed over the first clue because I have very little interest in target shooting, and even f I had paid more attention I would not have pieced that together with Fitz throwing himself into the river to realize that Fitz was reenact in the death. -I thought that she did a good job linking how the struggles of the first gen characters impacted the next generation. I thought that Taylor's processing of the relationship with her mother was pretty authentic and I enjoyed reading her insights on the different types of relationships that one can have. -Why would Hannah not refer to the fact that she was Taylor's aunt though? It just seemed weird that she had seemed to identify as an aunt before the abandonment, and then she pretty much was like a distant counselor once Taylor was a student. I know she wasn't supposed to be a ""mom"" per Tate's orders, but she seemed unnecessarily distant considering how much she was able to bond with Fitz's kid.-Maybe I have been overdosing on too much YA lately, but is was probably a bit too much ""poor communication"" drama mystery for me. I think that the author has an incredible way with words that made me like this book much more than if it had been done by someone else. I look forward to reading more of her work in the future, and maybe giving this book another crack.",0,default,[]

Which wouldn't be so bad... if I didn't finish it three days ago.I've come to view media from two - and only two - perspectives. Entertainment. Enlightenment. When I read Wealth of Nations, I don't expect to be entertained, I expect to be enlightened. That is fair, I think. When I watch Avengers, I expect to be entertained but not enlightened. That, too, is fair. Perhaps what is less fair is that when I read a novel, I expect to be both entertained and enlightened. Fair or not, that is how I judge the value of fiction. I expect to learn something new and I expect to be entertained as I do. My criteria for new knowledge are not stringent: I will take concrete knowledge about a culture, or a place, or a scientific theory, or a time in history, but I will also accept more nebulous knowledge, like a new idea, a new perspective, or even a new way of wording things.Once, for example, I went to a poetry reading of a Russian poet whose name I cannot recall who read poems about stuff I cannot recall. There were some fancy schmancy metaphors, I believe. There usually are. But I can't recall any of them. Except for one: the poet compared love to a chemical bond. He said, ""I cannot unlove you. You changed my chemical composition."" What a fabulous way of looking at it! That's all I remember. But it was worth it.Jellicoe Road did not give me even that. I learned the plot of course, the characters, the basic vibe and feel and emotion of it. It was far from a boring read. Yet nothing managed to make its way from the pages and into ME. I grew in neither mind nor spirit.Now it is no fault of Jellicoe Road that I am well read, that I am knowledgeable, that I am no longer a teenager. But then neither can I be expected to review it from a perspective other than my own. I think that, for a non-trivial set of people, there is MUCH to learn here, for the writing is clean and good and far from bereft of memorable lines.Yet those two missing stars is not entirely subjective either. The characters behave oh so predictably until about 100 pages in. Taylor, our relatable-but-not-likable protaganist, angsts up a storm. The adults are woefully absent and predictably oblivious. And tough guy Jonah Griggs plays tough macho guy to a T. He's tough, yo. It's not until this scene in a jail, when Jonah actually shows some compassion, that the story starts, that the characters are actually allowed to become humans, instead of cardboard cut-outs. Now, I'm not the only one who's saying this. Read even those 5 star reviews in here and you'll see them mention how it has a slow start. Most attribute it to the ""confusing"" pseudo-split narrative (which I didn't find confusing at all - in fact the 'mystery' seemed blatantly obvious to me, but luckily I wasn't reading it as a mystery and so therefore did not mind), but I would argue it's a matter of bad characterization.In particular: Hannah, who has been Taylor's caretaker ever since Taylor was abandoned by her mother some six or seven years earlier. Much of Taylor's angst derives from Hannah's disappearance early on in the novel. Unfortunately, her disappearance occurs before Hannah's character is even established! So there's this immediate disconnect between the reader and Taylor, and her angst therefore takes awhile to settle in and feel organic.Which it does. The characters do gain depth and heft and humanity. The split narrative eventually melds together, even has a delightful parallelism to it. The story gains poignancy and emotion and life.Yet, perhaps because of these early flaws, what I said about a lack of enlightenment still holds true. I gained very little. This is a story, whose emotional beats I have already tread many a time. This is not a unique story, not a unique setting, not a unique voice.As such, for me, Jellicoe Road is three stars. Objectively, I would say it's four stars. And for some lucky individuals, it has everything a novel needs to be a full five stars. I begrudge them that not at all.",0,default,['young-adult']

When she was 11 Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother at a 7-11 gas station. A stranger named Hannah picks her up and takes her to the boarding school where Taylor spends the next six years feeling abandoned. There is one incidence when she is 14 when she tries to run away to find her mother, but the Cadet who is with her gets scared and calls his school. The Brigadier stops them before Taylor can see her mother. Everything changes when Taylor is in her last year of school and Hannah disappears without a note. Taylor feels abandoned all over again. In addition, the start of the territory wars between the Cadets, including the Cadet who ran away with her, townies, and the school. Taylor struggles with her depression and overwhelming sense of loneliness as she deals with her feelings towards that Cadet and discovers her family history. Throughout Taylor's narrative are stories by Hannah, which turn out to be her teenage history that is markedly linked to Taylor's. There are a lot of depressed people and secrets in the story, both of which bug me. The depressed people I get because all of them have suffered tragic events, but it isn't necessarily lighthearted to read about. One thing I wish Marchetta had done is include more descriptions of the characters. I have no idea what any person looks like, except for Taylor's mother and Santangelo. It was very confusing at first to get the characters straight, especially since the story starts with Hannah's story and then the next chapter abruptly jumps to Taylor's POV. I felt like I need to draw a character map to keep everyone straight. There could have been more character development and description to sort everyone out.(Spoilers in the next paragraph)My biggest problem with the story and what keeps me from absolutely loving this novel is the adults in the story. Where are they? And why do they feel the need to keep secrets? Hannah is Taylor's mother's childhood friend and her father's sister. She should have told Taylor about their family connection. There was no point in keeping it a secret. When Hannah took Taylor in she promised Taylor's mom that she would not act like Taylor's mom, but that didn't mean she couldn't be the aunt or tell Taylor stories about her mom. Instead, Hannah continues to make Taylor feel unloved and like she doesn't have a family. Also, Taylor's mom was a worthless drug addict whose wishes maybe weren't worth keeping. Taylor deserved a mom and Hannah could have filled that role because Taylor deserved to be loved even if it hurt Taylor's mom's feelings. I think Hannah probably still had mental problems (severe depression, etc.) leftover from her childhood, and that may be why she didn't always make the right decisions. The Brigadier also annoys me because he kept secrets about his past, and again, there was no point in leaving all the mysteries around him so that people thought he was a serial killer. Besides the fact that there were some unnecessary secrets kept by Hannah and the Brigadier, the story is good. It has a magical feel to it, like there's something about the setting and story that isn't quite real. I enjoyed Marchetta's writing style (except for some confusion at the beginning). I think some people will really like the story and others will kind of like it, but I don't think anyone will hate it. On the Jellicoe Road reminds me of a lot of the other recent YA Australian novels, and if you have enjoyed some of those (e.g. Jasper Jones, Graffiti Moon) then you should enjoy this one.",0,default,['read-2013']

Before purchasing, I always do a fair deal of Goodreads research on my selections and the ratings for this book were off the chart. Nearly all the reviewers I follow had read it at one point or another, and all of them had given it a final five star rating. But I just didn't fall like the rest of you, unfortunately.As forewarned in several reviews, Jellicoe Road was very difficult to break into. Marchetta wastes zero time on explanation or world-building, preferring instead to simply toss you in and let you figure it all out on your own. It was an interesting experience (and not one I can say I've had before in the Young Adult genre) but the more I think about it, the more I think that there's a reason authors tend to avoid revealing so little. With such minor exposition, I read through the first one hundred and fifty pages (at least) without a clue as to what was going on and without emotional attachment to any of the characters, which I find sad in retrospect because they truly were an amazing set of individuals.The second issue I had was that, once I finally read far enough to appreciate the story and feel included, I unraveled the mystery far too quickly. By the time I reached the climax at the end, the swell of emotion didn't overwhelm me; I'd already figured it all out and that unfortunately made the packaging of the big reveal feel gratuitously melodramatic.Most of all, I severely struggled with believability from about halfway into the novel until the end. (view spoiler)[Why on earth would Hannah not tell Taylor who her parents were? Why didn't The Brigadier explain it to her when Hannah disappeared and Taylor was so clearly looking for answers? I found the ""true identity"" secrecy ridiculous and necessary only because it was convenient to the plot. And I was left with so many questions: What are the odds that Fitz just happened to aim exactly where Webb was sitting in that tree? And if he had a clear enough vantage point to hit a can, how on earth did he miss seeing a teenage body falling into the river immediately after? Why would five people who enjoyed spending time together start a ""war"" about boundaries—Wouldn't they want to share their space equally because they liked each other? How did Taylor not know her own mother's first name? I could go on, but I think I've made my point. (hide spoiler)]But, looking past all of my negatives listed above, I did find Marchetta's writing style to be absolutely gorgeous, as promised. The pages were filled with lyrical, flowing prose that held all the right emotions. No complaint there at all. The Australian settings were gorgeous and unlike anything else I'd read in a book before. And by the end, I was undeniably attached to several of the characters (predictably, Jonah Griggs was my absolute favorite, closely followed by Ben (who was adorable)).I have read reviews that say this book truly turns golden when read for a second time and I can completely believe that being true. But, as of this moment, I'm just not sure I'm invested enough to double the effort. I currently have Book One of her fantasy series on my to-read list; I guess we'll see how I handle that.",0,default,"['young-adult', 'fiction']"

La historia es trágica. Una niña de 11 años es abandonada por su madre en el camino de Jellicoe y es recogida por Hannah, una mujer agradable que la escolariza en el campamento que en ese mismo camino hay y cuida de ella.Será en el verano que Taylor Markham, la niña en cuestión, cumpla los 17 cuando la historia sobre 5 amigos que vivieron veinte años atrás allí le pique la curiosidad y le haga investigar. Más aún, cuando Hannah desaparece y encuentra un borrador sobre la historia de esos 5 chavales en la casa de Hannah. Comienza a sospechar que los rumores podrían ser verdad y a partir de ahí, los 3 grupos en que se divide el campamento y los cuales luchan entre sí aunarán fuerzas para descubrir lo que de verdad ocurrió en aquel camino.En este libro se juntan muchos sentimientos aunque muy bien descritos a lo largo del libro: miedo por un asesino en serie que anda suelto; melancolía por la desaparición inesperada de Hannah; dudas ante el comportamiento de John Griggs, jefe de uno de los grupos del campamento, quien a veces parece sentir algo por ella y otras la ignora; temor ante el brigadier, quien es su principal sospechoso de ser el asesino en serie y quien parece saber más de lo que aparenta.Muchas claves se irán resolviendo a lo largo del libro e incluso la protagonista compartirá un viaje inesperado en busca de respuestas que solo se verán resueltas de boca de la persona menos esperada.En primer lugar, la historia me ha gustado porque vemos dos historias diferentes mezcladas entre sí con muchos puntos en común y es la protagonista la encargada de ir uniéndolos. Con la ayuda de los chicos del grupo Cadete irá avanzando en sus pesquisas pero solo los verdaderos protagonistas podrán ayudarle a dar color a la imagen y desvelar toda la trama.He disfrutado de la historia individual de Taylor con su grupo de chicas, su sentimiento de independencia y a la vez de ese amor hacia Hannah que descubre una vez se ha ido ésta. También la historia de amistad-amor entre Taylor-Jonah y Raffy-Chaz. Y, sobre todo, cómo los grupos del campamento intentan invadirse unos a otros y tratan de hacer pactos, como si fueran ""pequeños guerreros"", y cómo se descubre cómo se originó todo aquello.Por otro lado, el libro, para mi gusto, también tiene cosas negativas. Una es que, al igual que cada persona es un mundo tampoco hay dos libros iguales y aunque la historia es estupenda, el final parece imitar en su narrativa al de The Lovely Bones y es algo que para mí le quita puntos pues no tienen nada que ver y el libro de Alice Sebold es bastante más trágico y emotivo. Otro punto negativo, de la historia es la cantidad de personajes que hay entre sus páginas y cómo eso puede hacer que el lector pierda el hilo fácilmente. En conclusión, un libro ameno y con el que es fácil engancharse y pasar una tarde entretenida, pero sin grandes pretensiones.",0,default,['read-2012']

I think I find it easier to engaged into a book when I am familiar with the setting, the rules, or the situations. Jellicoe Road does not take place in the US, it takes place in Australia. Although the novel takes place in a school, with traditions, I just feel like an outsider looking in. I like books that have a lot of unanswered questions, however, I felt like I didn't quite know where the book was doing. I didn't fully understand the plot. And I know for a fact that I will have to re-read the book to fully understand all parts of the book. So becaues I couldn't really find my comfort zone within the pages of the book, I couldn't give it a higher rating than 3 stars. I found the novel to be wonderfully written. I can understand why the novel won the Printz Award. The characters are full of depth and layers. I adore the character of Taylor for her rough exterior, her protective covering, yet having the softest heart and love for her House. I felt like Taylor, who was abandoned by her mom, knew how to be a mom to the younger girls in her house. She might have been tough, she might have yelled, she might have wanted her space but she really loved each and every girl. This novel needed a context by which Taylor could find out her history. I though the turf wars were a perfect way to set up this scavenger hunt. However, I felt like many of the situations that the students placed themselves into were unrealistic. Or maybe just unrealistic for the United States. I don't know how many boarding schools do not have a closer eye on their charges as they ran though the woods, having secret meetings on a nighly basis. The ending was emotional. I was happy that Taylor finally finds her family, the family that has been protecting her all her life. And it was very sad to see her mother die. I was not prepared for her mother actually coming back. As a reader, I was more prepared to hear that her mother had already passed. However, I was happy that Taylor got some sort of closure at the end. Although this novel is beautifully written, I would have to think it would be a hard sell for young adults. The language is rather high. The plot is set in a country they don't fully understand. However, Taylor's character is universal and can translate to the liking of the right student. What I liked most about this novel is that it talked about the feelings of those kids who are orpahned by their parents. Taylor was oraphned by her mother by choice. Where as a lot of the charges at the school were wards of the state for more tragic reasons. I think there may be some students who may relate to this feeling of being neglected or orphaned. I also think another question that can be explored using this novel is the idea of whether a drug addicted mother should give up custody of their child for the child's well being? So there is a lot of value and questions to be raised in this novel. ",0,default,[]

I don't really know what to think. Apparently everyone else is raving about it. I feel like maybe there's something I'm not quite getting about it.I mostly enjoyed it, and it was well written. But I also had problems with it. Like the whole 'war' set up seemed bizarre and inexplicable for much of the book. Maybe there were formatting issues with the ebook, but the switches between the present day narrative and what was eventually revealed to be Hannah's story were really abrupt and unsignalled. Not even a blank line between them. So I'd be reading about Taylor's day, and then I'd be half way through the next paragraph before I realised the narrative had switched to the other story line. The confusion never lasted long, but it was jarring and annoying.Speaking of confusion - I never got it straight in my head who all the kids in Hannah's story were. Every single one of them had a stupid non-gender-specific name. I knew who the characters were, but couldn't match the names to them, so never knew who was doing what. Even by the end of the book I couldn't tell you which one was Jude and which one was Webb :-/I didn't really like/buy/understand the supernaturally bits.And I never really understood the school set up. The kids seemed to have a ridiculous amount of freedom and responsibility. I get that part of the point must be that adults don't really feature cuz they're so irrelevant to the important bits of the kids lives, but it basically seemed like a load of teenagers lived in a house with no adult, and an arbitrarily chosen 17 year old (I only know she's 17 cuz all the other reviews say so. Maybe it said so on the back of the book - but I shouldn't have to rely on that for information. I don't recall it ever saying so in the actual story) is responsible for dozens of kids between the ages of 11 and 16. That seems... an unlikely set up.Then, having all been fun and hijinks (I guess*), it suddenly switches tone in the final quarter or so with some really unsavory revelations about Taylor's past.And finally, that zinger about 'the serial killer' was just a bit too much. It over-egged the pudding.Hmm, all I've done is complain about stuff, but honestly, I quite enjoyed the book despite all these grumbles! (I wouldn't have finished it otherwise). I'm sure everyone else has said what's good about it, so I'll leave my review here. * Personally I found it horrific that the musician had his fingers damaged (I assumed at first they were broken, but he seemed alright a bit later), but none of the characters seemed to think it was anything remotely important! I had a problem with Taylor falling for the guy who inflicted that damage.******** EDIT *********oh, actually having read some of the other reviews: No. No swooning. Not even a bit. What I liked about it was the authenticity of the teenage voice/experience. That's pretty much it.",0,default,[]

I was so sure I would. I remember epicreads posting quotes and pictures on Instagram and I immediately bought the book. So what happened? The book began in a very confusing way. There was no introduction to the character. It went from a italicized prologue to a 22 years later heading and then straight into the narration of Taylor Markham. Her voice was not different from the italicized sections, so at first I thought my Kindle bugged out and I wasn’t reading the beginning because I was so confused. Who is narrating? Is this not the same person? Where are we? What is happening? What war? WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?! Why am I supposed to care? What is important? WTF?! I felt like that for about 30% of the book, which is quite a large section to be confused and irritated. I knew from other reviews that the book would pick up soon and make sense, but I promised myself I would not rate it 5 stars even if I loved it because I wouldn’t forget how irritated the beginning was. Yes, now that I’m done it makes sense. Yes, it was a good story. Yes, I even cried. But the execution of Jellicoe Road was horrible and it’s not okay. I don’t forgive the author for the beginning. It should have done what beginnings of stories are supposed to do and explain, build, and draw me in. Not confuse the hell out of everyone. It’s not brilliant that it all “comes to together in the end” and makes sense. It’s crap. I loved the actual plot. I eventually enjoyed Taylor’s narration, even if I never quite connected with her. I still don’t feel like I knew her at all, but at least the pieces of her life were put together. I loved the end result of Jellicoe Road. It could have been an unforgettable and amazing story. I cannot say whether anyone was believable because I felt so disconnected from everyone. I was so confused for so long. I was angry at Taylor for being dull and not giving me more information. I liked figuring out who was who and finding out so many memories and layers were all interconnected, but I wish the execution of the story was different and smoother.  I wish I could give Jellicoe Road more credit for being amazing, but I just couldn’t get over the way it was told. I am frustrated that it wasn’t better and more organized because I would have absolutely loved it. I am used to strange writing styles, being thrown into a story, and being told two different stories. I’m used to YA. I’m used to this kind of fiction. Unfortunately, this just didn’t work for me. I am giving it 3 stars because it was a good story, so I don't want to underrate it.Review Originally published at Love, Literature, Art, and Reason book Review Blog",0,default,[]

I liked this book but this was a hard book to like. Marchetta starts it out in a very confusing way that really turns the reader off to the book and it takes a little while to get into it.The book is WILDLY depressing. I mean, even the happier parts of it really aren't all that happy. Happy part: Jessa doesn't die. Happy part: Taylor finds out about her family and who they are. Happy Part: Taylor finds love. And, I guess that the teritory wars are kind of over by the time the book is over. They've all become friends.But the inbetween is so tragic. It's all steeped in loss; the Loss of Hannah's parents and then her brothers and, even at the end of the day, Tayor's mother. It's this group of kids who can never seem to catch a break. And then, just when Taylor figures it all out, figures her family all out, figures out that her House on Jellicoe Road has really been her family and home all along... it burns down. And she almost loses part of the family that she has.Also, Taylor starts out as this strong character and she gets... weepy a lot. I don't know. I get that the idea is that Marchetta wants her to learn to depend on the people around her, and I like that she learned to depend on the people in her house, like Raffy (I LOVED Raffy) but Griggs... I don't know. Her romance with Griggs just always kind of bothered me. They were so co-dependant and not in a healthy kind of way.I liked the character development of the Five. We got all this backstory about them even though a lot of them were dead. I loved hearing their story and hearing how they shaped Jellicoe road. They made a lot of the history of that place happen. I liked finally knowing what did happen to everyone and that you were kind of let to know along the way without being told. I DIDN'T like that you never really learned what happened to Webb. Yes, you learned that his brother Fitz shot him, but you never really figured that out until Taylor told you. And how did everyone else figure that out? I figured he'd been missing all these years but they all knew. I mean, for a story so centrally located around one boy, and what happened to him, I think we should have gotten a little more closure about his story.But I like that Hannah found family and I like that Taylor did too. I like that Jellicoe Road is this place of sadness and safety at the same time. I really liked Marchetta's writing. I'd be interested to read other things that she wrote.

I've just become that guy who strongly dislikes your favorite book. You know that big revelation-y movie moment where the hero turned villain looks in the mirror and thinks ""Who have I become?"" 

That's me. The guy who disliked it. I look down the Goodreads page and cannot find a single review that was not five stars. I feel evil. Why didn't I like the book? Well, let's just be clear on one thing: Melina Marchetta didn't do anything wrong. The book had narrative structure, character motivation, lyricism, and that ever important note of finality. But I just didn't believe it. I didn't feel emotionally involved in the story. I didn't find a connection with any of the characters, but to be fair Marchetta didn't give me any trails to hold onto. I felt like I was catapulted into the middle of the book; there was no build-up, no clarification, and no way to see insight into the protagonist's mind. I personally think this book would have benefited strongly from a first person narrative. I found Taylor's character to be interesting, but I just didn't feel connected to her. I felt like I was looking at the car crash, not like I was a part of it. But the ending was alright. Marchetta's strongest trait is her use of lyricism, and it's prominent towards the end. So, yeah. I did not like your favorite book and I feel like a terrible bastard for it (I wanted to like it). Just picture, if you will, that you never liked Harry Potter despite the popularity. Picture that despite the things you heard you heard about Pride and Prejudice, it was a letdown. My inability to like this book is my loss. It's as if I've forgotten how to feel emotion.

Six years later, she find herself as the unwilling leader in her school's traditional battle with the Cadets and Townies. But Taylor has a history with the leader of the Cadets, and teen war games begin to take a back seat toward Taylor's journey to discover the truth about her family. I know I am in the minority rating this book so low compared to all the other glowing 5 star reviews. I didn't hate the book, but I didn't love it either. I liked it, but that's it. I wanted to love it. I’ve read so many great reviews about it that I was so sure it would be a beautiful, poignant story that I would love. And I tried to love it. I tried to care about the characters, to understand them, to love the writing and appreciate the story. I think it was the writing that stilted the story for me. I didn’t really care for it. It is unique and does have a certain charm to it. But it seemed a little weird and random at times. As a result, the characters never did reach into my heart. There were times when I felt for them, when I wanted them to find their story and unravel their past, but they didn’t cry out to me with heartfelt emotion.I found the names really confusing and gender-neutral. Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, Fitz, Raffy. I found the setting and groups of people - townies, cadets - confusing. And the whole territory wars didn't make a lot of sense to me. If the Cadets are only there for a short time, what is the big deal about having boundaries and claiming territory. It just seemed like a side story that wasn't really important. There was also a death that I felt wasn't explained well at all.I had a difficult time actually getting into the story. It took almost 3/4ths of the book before I become really intrigued and felt enough emotion from the characters to care about what happened to them. The beginning was confusing, but then it started making a little more sense, and I became intrigued. There are some beautiful, heartbreaking moments in it, sweet tender moments that made me smile.

Damn it. Not again. Anything but this again. Oh well.I didn't like it. It comes very simply to this. This book presents a mess of confusion that is a puzzle dumped out on a table. Taylor's story is the border pieces, Narnie's is the guess-where-to-even-start middle, and the manufacturer declined to put a picture on the box, so you just have to start putting together like colors and hope you can begin to see what they might comprise. I dutifully pulled out a piece of scrap paper, and started tracking the 5 characters of the second plot, while guessing how they connected to the first plot, because the point is they're connected, right? Or why else are we spending time on this, and I was, I have to admit, bored. The mystery wasn't keeping me engaged enough, and because I was working on the pieces, they weren't inspiring an emotional connection. How can you care about something if you can't even make out what it is?Then roughly halfway through, Marchetta is like, ""Maybe this will help,"" and gives some better direction on what's supposed to go where, and I figured out what the puzzle was supposed to look like, except at that point I really didn't care. Let me say for the millionth time I had a shitty childhood pushed along by a crazy mother, and Taylor did not give me the feels about it (view spoiler)[and I'm annoyed by how nobly her mother is presented in the in end, because...bullshit. She damages Taylor at every turn and we're supposed to get the warm fuzzies because she was broken and she's dying.  (hide spoiler)]. I didn't care about her or Griggs, or how everything fit together.I didn't cry. I didn't feel a sweep of love and affection. I didn't feel catharsis. The only thing that I even mildly connected with was Narnie's act of sacrifice to protect her brother's spirit. I was dumbfounded. It was created drama. If Hannah had just been honest with Taylor instead of cloaking things in mystery, this wouldn't have even been a story.Emotionally this book was a giant miss for me, but I think it was technically well-written, if occasionally boring, thus the three stars.",0,default,"['unlikable-main-character', 'romance-element', 'sync-ya', 'narrative-gimmick', 'relationships']"

It took me really long to get into it, for the first 100-120 pages i didn't comprehend the sense of the story at all.2. Also, i found Taylor Markham a little hard to relate to, i'm quite different from her so she didn'T exactly give me wow moments (though i did mark some stuff)3. What exactly is the point of those territory wars? How are they held, i mean. I thought the procedure was weird. To me it seemed more like kids wanting to be rebellious.Now, one might think why i ended up giving 'Jellicoe Road' four stars, despite all the above.A lot of that faded after about a third of the book, when i started to see an actual storyline beginning to unfold. The characters, who i so far only knew from the surface, got a deeper personality. Though i have to admit, there was not one character who i felt like i knew. Perhaps there were just to many, from the past and from the present.I was a little overstrained at first, i mixed up the characters and now, after having finished, i still don't comprehend exactly what the point of the hermit was. I know it was Fitz, but through those short description of the many different deaths of the past and the present, i had trouble remembering who died which way.I suppose i should reread this book in a few months time.The writing was poetic, in my opinion. It intruiged me to read on, if only for the structure and the metaphors. That, i have to admit, is the beautiful side of this book.It's not the kind of writing that draws you in and doesn't let you put the book down, at least it wasn't for me, but it's raw and emotional in a way.It inspired me and it gives this book something special that i can't seem to fathom into words, but that's why i believe three stars would not be enough.I have hoped to enjoy this book more than i actually did, but still, it was a beautiful read in a way.3.5 stars :)Edit: I ended up changing it to three stars, because compared to other books this one just wasn't as good.

It came up under suggested reads quite a few times and on more than a few must read lists. In addition, it's received many glowing reviews by people I follow right here on Goodreads. So imagine my disappointment when I was underwhelmed while reading On the Jellicoe Road. Wait, let me back up. Before I felt underwhelmed, I felt confused. Yes, I'd say I was mainly confused. See, in addition to reading the book itself, I also read ABOUT the book, so I know confusion was a common complaint. But no worries. This will remedy itself around 100 pages in. Yes, you read that right. 100. PAGES. IN. (Mind you, this book is only 290 pages).Color me dumb, but I read way past the 100 page mark and still felt that I wasn't smart enough for this book. Yes, things came together a bit at the end, but for at least half of the story, I found myself scratching my head in confusion. For example, I personally didn't see the need for the war between the Townies and Cadets where the characters and their complexities seemed to be story enough. I also didn't understand the tone of this war. In the beginning it sounded like serious, apocalyptic, impending doom. But before long the groups started hanging out together. Were they enemies? Was it all in fun? I still really have no idea.I think the war was just a way to place the main characters of Taylor and Jonah at odds. They have a history with each other, but it didn't end well. Now they are leading opposing teams in the seasonal fight. Oooh, how apropos. And Taylor's mentor Hannah's disappearance? A way for Taylor to rediscover her roots I suppose.So if I didn't really enjoy On the Jellicoe Road, then why the 3 star rating you might ask? Well that's because I have to give credit where credit is due. Author Melina Marchetta really does have a way with words, even if I didn't always get all the words once they were strung together to make a story.

For me, the first part of the book was chopped up too much, jumping between past and present, fact and fiction, leaving so many unexplained statements that it was a little frustrating. Once I understood enough of the story, it finally flowed.The story is doled out in bits and pieces to maintain suspense for the reader, but it doesn't really make sense. The main character knows a lot about the central events, but the information that she knows is provided piecemeal to the reader. Once I had enough of the information, I had to wonder why the main character had been so clueless. The main character has also forgotten a lot of information that she remembers at convenient points throughout the story. For example, she told a story about her childhood to a friend, but she has forgotten the story. It was often implausible that she would have forgotten important events or failed to make connections. It came across as a plot device.However, I really liked the interactions between the teenage leaders of different factions and their war. I liked the uniqueness of their world. The main device used to reveal the story was an interesting choice, even if I would have liked it to be a little more clear what was going on right from the beginning. I'm not sure if the things that I liked about this book (that were 4 stars) were enough to outweigh the things that felt inauthentic, like the adult characters' inconsistent personalities and actions or the main character's inability to remember things or make connections just five or seven years later. The material is definitely for an older teen, in my opinion. I'm not going to put it with the books for Caroline to read in high school, but I'm not going to get rid of it either.

It has been almost 20 years since I first read Looking for Alibrandi in high school, but for the last 6 months this book had been staring at me from my to-read pile and I finally gave in and read it.The reason why this book won't get a 5 star review from me is because I spent what felt like the first half of the book with giant question marks hovering above my head. What is going on here? What kind of a school is this? Who is in charge here? Why don't the kids seem to have any authority figures? For the longest time, no answers were given to any of these questions. What was offered instead was a dual perspective between the main character, Taylor, and the third person narrative of a group of kids called Narnie, Fitz, Jude, Tate and Web. We had no idea who these kids were or where they fit in.I made notes along the way as I was reading when things started to become clear to me, and even when I stopped thinking about putting this down and started to enjoy it. This would not have been a book I would have read all the way through had it not been for all the reviewers before me who had the same problem and promised that it got better after it go past halfway. For all that, once I started to enjoy the book, I really started to enjoy the book. Taylor's reading of the previous group of kids who had gone through a very similar situation to herself, Griggs, Santangelo and Raffy grew on me. Once the book became less The Hunger Games before The Hunger Games was written and more a kind of mystery pushing towards the end where we actually get the answers we've been craving, as well as gifting me with the gratification of characters who actually interact and actually contribute something to each others' lives, I found myself enjoying it a lot more.Melina Marchetta is obviously a very talented writer.

The Prologue was a 5, but with Chapter One it dropped to about a 1 1/2 to 2. The first 150 pages I spent mildly interested and very confused. I've read books that have gone back and forth between past and present and have been able to follow them, but the way this book was written was difficult to figure out in the beginning. The author knew all the characters and how they connected, but there's a lot of confusion until the reader (or maybe just me) is finally able to start piecing together where they each belong in the story. The other thing that made it a 2 was the ""territory wars"" between the teenagers in the book (all adults were oblivious). Was it really a war? Are there going to be casualties or are they just going to keep arguing with each other? Why does it matter who controls the club house or the prayer tree? At one point it seemed like little more than school rivalries, but ended with somewhat interesting insight on how the ""war"" began in the first place. I might not have been able to connect with that part of the story because it's been quite awhile since high school. The book is definitely geared towards teenagers (although, I won't be recommending it to any).The italicized glimpses into the past were always rated about a 4. The tragedy that brought together five friends and the mystery of what happened to each of them was what gave this book it's character and made it worth it to keep reading.As the story lines merged around page 250 or so, my rating went from about 2 stars to 4 stars, dropped briefly to a 1, and then rebounded to a 3. The heart of the story dealt with devastating tragedy and deep friendship that lasted even after death and the profound impact it had on the next generation. The ending truly came full-circle. I'm stuck between 2 1/2 to 3 stars for an overall rating. ",0,default,[]

What unraveled it for me was my firsthand knowledge of asthma, post traumatic stress disorder, and the re-emergence of suppressed memories. When the heroine in the story, Hannah Markham, who suffered from all of those aforementioned qualities, would slip into an asthma attack, it was poorly described. She biked and ran seemingly great distances without any effects to her lungs. People talked her down from an asthma attack. I don't buy it. I feel like more time should have been spent developing how an asthma attack feels and should be taken care of if you're going to use it in a book, or not use it at all. For someone that has asthma it feels insulting, it just doesn't seem like it's a big deal, when it actually could kill you if not dealt with properly. The disregard in such a popular book is like ""Oh, it's just asthma, you'll be fine."" As far as the PTSD goes, the effects are glossed over, the recovery is quick. Again, not buying it. Some of the triggers for the suppressed memories feel more accurate however. The recovery rate is different with everyone that suffers through something traumatic. But Hannah Markham has an extraordinarily high amount of traumatic events throughout her life that have been suppressed. Does this make her tougher or more vulnerable to the most traumatic one? But again, it seems that in telling the story, the author had a chance to shed light on the effects of PTSD and did a shoddy job of it. All of this being said, the characters are well developed, the story itself is interesting and well enough told. There are some twists in it that are unexpected. I simply knew too much from a medical perspective about things that I care about on a personal level that have affected a loved one of roughly the same age as Hannah. I guess I just wanted this author who told a good story, to take up the mantle of a powerful pen as well, and make it the best story ever told. I didn't happen for me this time.",0,default,[]

I had started this one in my classroom and was stymied a little bit because it is by an Australian author and it was a little confusing at first to figure out what was going on. For example, I wasn't too sure of the type of school that Taylor (the main character was in) and why there was this pseudo war going on between kids. I was also having a hard time determining the time periods since there is two narratives taking place but no clear dates associated with either. Once I got all of that sorted out, I really did enjoy the storyline and I felt like Marchetta's writing is really beautiful. The story centers around a young girl Taylor whose drug-addicted mother dropped her off on the Jellicoe Road when she was 11. She is taken to a boarding school and begins a close relationship with Hannah, a mysterious young woman who lives on the property. Taylor is also haunted by her past, a suicide that she witnessed when she was younger and a runaway attempt where she met a boy named Jonah, but who later betrayed her. Flash forward to present day Taylor who is engaged in a territory war with two other groups of kids (one led by Jonah), her feelings towards Jonah and the mystery surrounding Hannah's disappearance and finding her mother.The story also includes a flashback of the aftermath of a horrible car accident twenty years prior. You find out later that this story connects to Hannah's life. So overall, On the Jellicoe Road is confusing, but still sweet and I found myself rereading parts to make sure I didn't miss anything.

I'm talking 65% finished and then I'm just starting to actually like it. The whole first half of the book is just a turf war, basically. I thought it was going to be a mystery and it started off well, with that back story, which I was interested in but then we're in present time with the main character who I thought was a boy because I've always looked at the name Taylor as a boys name (I'm sorry!) and then they said she and I was like thank god they cleared that up because I was lost as hell. Speaking of names, they were all pretty atrocious. I look at Tate as a boys name too and every time I read it my mind automatically shifted it as a male and I was like ""Shit! No that's a girl."" So all the names kind of irked me (Jessa was nice, that was pretty. I don't know what the fuck Raffy was. That's not even a gender or suited for an animal. Poor girl, she was such a good character too. Unfortunate.)Anyway, after they finally stopped bullshitting about the turf war that I didn't care about at all and was spoon out my eyes annoying the story finally got interesting enough to carry on with. It was all really, really predictable though? I don't know. It was written well and it was darker than most YA so bravo for having balls since most authors lack that now but still, I guess with such a hype I just expected more.(it sounds like I hated it but I didn't, it just irked me a bit.)I think I'm just starting to fall out of YA and that pains me to say because I didn't think that day would come.

One can imagine my surprise because my emotions are never mixed and unknown to me!!! I read many reviews that said it's soooo emotional and I think I numbed myself out in order to secretly prove them wrong. I'm not going to lie it was hella confusing but it was also entrapping of my attention.I lived and breathed that book for the week it took me to read it and even though I wanted to give it up because it confused me so much I couldn't do it. I was very, very fucking angry by the time I finished reading it because it was unlike any other book I've ever read. Most stories are so cut in dry with the beginning, middle, and end and I began to discover why it was almost scattered so neatly. It was scattered in a way that made sense but still remained mysterious. It was a great paradox and I think it was this way because Taylor was a paradox herself. She was scattered but still somehow remained put together. She was emotional but still soo numb. She was confused but also so understandable of her life. And I think the thing I failed to realize while reading this book was the fact that I was Taylor, I was her emotions, I had become her through reading her story. I was no longer just a reader enjoying the words on a page but I was Taylor Markham. I was trying to hard to figure out the sequences to a story much like she tried to understand her life. I had become her when I numbed myself, unwilling to feel any emotion. So for that I give it a five stars because no book has ever forced me into the realization that I wasn't just the reader but I had become the character reliving the memories of her life for the very first time.",0,default,[]

I picked it up because I finally felt ready to commit to another book after The Hating Game, and I figured this would be a nice YA book to ease me back in. Except it's been too many years since I read my last Melina Marchetta book, and I forgot that she does not traffic in nice. Her books are grief and pain and emotional trauma.I am torn because, on the one hand, it's a Melina Marchetta book, which means it is well-written and feels very real. She throws you in the deep end to start with, and the book feels very mysterious as you are presented with two stories that seem unrelated, and you spend the first 100 or so pages trying to figure out who everyone is and what is going on. I actually really enjoyed how the two stories ended up interweaving, and how the mystery is slowly revealed.On the other hand, I found it really really really frustrating at how the adults in the story refused to tell the main character anything. So much would have been solved with just a little bit of frankness. Sure, I get that you don't tell children every horrible thing that happens, but there were some basic facts of the story that there was no reason to keep secret, even from a ten year old, let alone from a seventeen year old. It felt like secrets for the sake of the mystery, and the adults came off looking incredibly stupid and negligent because of it.Because of this, I have to knock it down to three stars, even though while reading it, I would probably have given it four. Be warned though, this is not the book to pick if you are looking to feel good. It is sad, and horrific, and only at the very end is it hopeful.",0,default,['young-adult']

On top of that, she has to deal with leading her boarding school houses in a territory war against the neighboring Townies and the military school Cadets, even though she has a crush on both leaders of the rival factions.Verdict: Confusing, drags in parts, but fun nonetheless.Positive: The mystery was well-crafted and took me a while to figure out. The book's message eventually is about love, friendship, and standing together instead of picking each other apart. The romance was also decent once it got off the ground.Negative: It took me over 150 pages to figure out what was going on. Territory wars? Cadets? There was exposition, but it didn't really clarify things for me. Marchetta isn't big on setting the scene, either. I couldn't for the life of me get a grasp of the big picture. The mystery took a while to get off the ground, too.

In the five or so years since, I realized I forgot so much about this story that I had to revisit it and, well, here we are. One of the things that I forgot about this book was how confusing it is initially. I had read this, and I knew what the big reveals were going to be, and yet, I couldn't help but feel lost at times. I also forgot about the teen angst. I'm pretty sure I was a teenager myself when I read this book so maybe I understood Taylor better, but this time around, I was kind of over it. Don't get me wrong, I love me an angry, unlikable and bitter protagonist, but Taylor walks the thin line between unlikable and I'm-better-than-everyone-else. There are instances where the writing patronizes ""other girls"" - those who flirt and only care about boys and obviously can't be witty or smart. NO. We're not doing this anymore. Not in 2020, satan. There's also another aspect of this story that I never paid much attention to but I can't help focusing on it now: It's the casual physical violence? (view spoiler)[ Taylor slaps Jonah, Jonah beats up Ben, Jonah grabs Taylor by her neck and shoves her against the wall? (hide spoiler)] Why was that necessary?

Because Jellicoe Road is many things, many of which I didn't enjoy, yes, but most importantly, it was  tranquil, and for me, that was the novel's winning streak. Slow-paced and off to a sort of vapid start, I had trouble immersing myself into the story at first. There are present day chapters, and then we suddenly switch to another timeline where completely different characters are doing completely unrelated things, and to be honest, I think that could have been handled a little better, especially the introduction of all the characters to the reader. But what I did not expect was how beautifully Marchetta was able to weave both the past and the present together without me really noticing until it was right in front of my eyes. While I can't really say that I was attached to any of the characters in particular, I did care about them to some degree, enough for what happened to them to matter to me. And while the climax is heartbreaking and sorrowful, I still felt this weird sort of detachment, which I think I'll chalk up to Marchetta's writing style. Taylor was a great narrator, and so were Narnie and Jude. I do think this had more potential, or maybe just not the right kind of read for me at the moment. Either way, I would definitely recommend it to someone who's looking for something tranquil, calm, and nostalgic. ",0,default,[]

The shift in the two points of view could at first be really difficult to follow especially when you're still trying to get to know the characters. However, once you get accustomed to it, boy, will you appreciate the power of Melina Marchetta's writing ability. I'm glad I didn't put down this story (when I was getting frustrated by the first half, hehe) because the second half was such an experience. I have to admit, though, that I found the supporting characters more interesting than Taylor. I just didn't really care for her and the only reason why I finished the book was that I was really interested in Hannah's story. Also, I hoped that there would be more to the territory wars plot. It kind of disappeared in the second half of the book which is a bit disappointing after so much build-up in the first half. Jonah Griggs' story is also a fascinating one and I found myself wishing that his past would be explored more. His speech regarding his guilt over his father's death was my favorite in this story. I considered giving this two and a half stars because while I didn't hate it, I wouldn't say that I liked it that much that I'd use it to introduce Marchetta's works to my friends (I'd suggest the Lumatere Chronicles, by the way).

There was a great story in there, but it was coated in layers and layers of over-the-top drama and unbelievable events. This book opens with Taylor, abandoned by her mother in a boarding school on Jellicoe Road, becoming the school leader in the war against the ""cadets"" and the ""townies"". This is a really cool idea, and it brings some playful fun to the novel. And true-to-form, Marchetta puts together an awesome cast of characters, that feel real and form such amazing connections with each other. Each feels unique without simply being ""quirky"". But throughout the book, Taylor also learns about a group of kids that used to go to live in Jellicoe before she was even born. Thus follows a series of revelations of unbelievable connections between Taylor & the group, which she takes forever to realise, but that's pretty obvious to the reader much sooner. This part kind of ruined the story a little for me, because it broke away from the ""realism"" that Marchetta usually brings to her novels, and felt out of place. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had slowed down a little, and cut out half of the drama/so-called ""mystery"".Nevertheless, I would still recommend that you read this book, because it has a lot to offer.

Read it purely because a friend said I should and stuck with it because everyone said I should even when I wanted to give up and I'm glad I did. I found that the first 150 pages were really really confusing. I literally didn't have a clue what was going on, who anyone was or why they were doing the things they were. The writing was really beautiful and strangely intense but I was just so confused and had I not been recommended the book by someone else I probably would have given up at this point. Suddenly after all the time of confusion things started to click into place and I started to get what was going on, who was who and how the whole narrative fit together which made it so much easier for me as a reader to connect to the book. Once I got to that part I was drawn in and completely fascinated by what was happening to the point where I needed to keep reading to find out more about the characters and how everything linked up which was done so cleverly. I realise this review actually tells you very little about the book itself. It's because I can't work out ow to put everything into words.

Tudo ao mesmo tempo. É o que costumo chamar de livro quebra-cabeça. A autora espalha as peças sobre a mesa e deixa que o leitor tente encaixá-las sozinho por um tempo antes de começar a jornada guiada.A história acompanha a vida de Taylor, menina de 17 anos que foi abandonada quando mais nova, e agora estuda em um internato. Há dois conflitos que movem Taylor:- O passado: Ela não sabe quem é seu pai e desconhece o paradeiro da mãe, e quer preencher essa lacuna da sua vida a todo custo, embora nenhum dos mais velhos a ajude com pistas ou informações.- O presente: Taylor está assumindo o ""comando"" de uma das casas do internato bem na época em que começa uma tradicional disputa territorial da região. As meninas do orfanato, os citadinos - moradores da cidade, e cadetes que acampam por ali nessa época se enfrentam em um jogo de regras definidas que coloca os 3 grupos sempre em situações delicadas.Além de se revezar entre esses dois conflitos, tentando nos ambientar com a brincadeira, a autora conta duas outras histórias, mais curtas porém importantes:- Sonhos: Taylor tem sempre um sonho estranho. Um garoto no alto de uma árvore que vem falar com ela. Os sonhos a deixam perturbada com alguma frequência.- Livro: A mulher que cuida de Taylor está escrevendo um livro, uma história com menos disputas territoriais e mais amizade. Sempre que Taylor pode, ela rouba algumas páginas para ler. Um livro quebra-cabeça, um livro de histórias dentro de histórias, exige mais do leitor. Não tem jeito. Você precisa ficar atento a tudo que é dito, mesmo quando nada parece fazer sentido, para conseguir juntar as peças. E se o livro parece confuso de início por conta disso, a sensação de recompensa é muito grande quando o quebra-cabeça começa a se formar. Lembra um pouco o ""Conta Comigo"" do Stephen King, só que muito menos didático. Como a escrita da Melina Marchetta é boa, dá pra encarar a parte confusa sem trauma. E do meio em diante, você vai notar que o ritmo de leitura aumentará consideravelmente. Saindo um pouco das tramas, vale dizer que o ponto forte são os personagens incrivelmente reais. Tanto os amigos de Taylor quanto os rivais parecem gente de verdade com quem conversamos no dia a dia. Se você gosta de YA, quer fugir do esquemão americano e não se incomoda com um pouco de desafio, fica de sugestão.",12,default,['2016-leituras']

The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-la.”***I’m compelled to rate this novel 5 stars (I'm really not stingy about giving books 5 stars), but for the wrong reason. The wrong reason being: peer pressure. All my GR friends gave this book a 5 star rating. It’s like a rite of passage, if you want to be taken as a ‘serious’ reader, you’d obviously have to be able to appreciate MM. And certainly, this book is an exemplary standard of what contemporary YA literature “should be,” instead of low-culture trash, like the Twilight series...And, while I admit my distaste for the Twilight series, I’d like to believe I’m not so snobby, or pretentious enough to look down on my fellow GR friends that actually enjoyed reading Twilight. However, it’d be a different story if they were claiming Twilight to be a masterful piece of literature, and that the film(s) blew their minds. Then, I might have to crawl under a rock. And weep, silently. However, here’s why I couldn’t rate this book a 5:First, I didn’t dislike the book. I did like it, and appreciated it so much more than Saving Francesca. But, like others have mentioned, the story started off a bit slow, and very confusing; and yet, I don’t think it HAD to be. So, if the confusion served no greater purpose in the story, why make it so difficult for the readers? Now, moving on to the romance...Why do authors feel the need to insert a love story in almost every single “young-adult” novel?! Don’t get me wrong, I’m all about the romance. But, what can I say about Griggs? He’s about as generic a character as Edward, from Twilight. What was so proprietary about his character that warrants praise from so many readers? He was a twisted, brooding soul, with a horrific, brutal past, and violent tendencies. Wow. That’s just so deep, right? Well, I guess I was expecting a bit more from his interactions with Taylor. There were glimpses of the moments Griggs & Taylor shared on that train when they were 14. And, they do spend quite some ‘interacting’ because of the territory wars. Yet, their romance was just a secondary story, in the overall plot, and it showed. This was my greatest let down (not that their romance was a secondary story, but that it felt like one). I would’ve liked to see more. Feel more. Not just told that Taylor’s love for him was so deep, and that no words could describe how she felt about him. Then, there’s Taylor. She’s the asthmatic girl that was left behind near a 7-eleven, abandoned by her druggie mother at the tender age of 7. That one line of description opens up so many possibilities. This character could’ve been so rich, and multifaceted. I could’ve been weeping, and hailing Taylor as one of my all-time favorite fictional heroines. And yet, there was such a deep bitterness to her that I couldn’t fully embrace. Also, I know this is totally messed up of me, and I’m likely to be accused of being some kind of masochist, but, I would’ve liked to see her knee-deep in trouble. She was obviously suffering, angry, and confused, yet she was picked to be the leader of her turf, and she seemed to be a good girl, for the most part. What happened to that girl that ran away? Where was all that anger, confusion, and desperation? OK, so she avoided her friends, treated them coldly, and didn’t want to form deep attachments. And, she had strange dreams… So what? I wanted to see, hear, taste, touch, and smell her pain. I didn’t. **However, despite my ‘issues’ with the book, I did find the writing to be particularly inspired. I especially loved the vivid, detailed imagery of Jellico Road. I also liked The Prayer Tree (what it symbolized), and all of the side stories, effortlessly woven together, to forge a harrowing coming of age story, dealing with loss, forgiveness, family, and love. “There is just something about that boy that makes me feel like I belong. Belong. Long to be. Weird word, but semantics aside, it is up there with solace.” ",4,default,['fiction']

I just went looking for a review from 16 year old me to see what exactly I thought as a teen, but it seems like I never did get around to writing one, although I do remember loving the book and recommending it left and right with lots of exclamation marks.I'm trying to re-read favorites this year and take advantage of being home with physical books this week so that's why it's my first read of 2017.A lot of it was a pretty fresh reading experience, as I had forgotten lots of the revelations in  Jellicoe Road, and the extent of tragedies within.I'll freely admit I was crying towards the end. I'm pretty sure I didn't cry over it as a teenager (I've turned into a big old softie).I kept thinking while I was reading: ""this is the quintessential contemporary YA book."" Like it's as good as contemporary YA is ever going to get. For me, in 2010, it was exactly the kind of book I wanted to read or write myself. It's off the charts angsty (angst being something I was incapable of recognizing as a teen, mired in it). Basically every major character is messed up colossally. It can get a little melodramatic just from the sheer number of tragedies in less than 300 pages spread through relatively few characters; two moms dying from cancer, two manslaughters committed by teens, a suicide and attempted one, a fatal car crash, drug addiction, teen pregnancy, a serial killer...But melodrama actually isn't a crime in fiction as some might have you believe, and Marchetta's prose is lovely enough you know you're in good hands. I think Marchetta is so sincere and writes so well that she steers clear of seeming like she's emotionally manipulating you with all the tragedy, when in clumsier and more cynical hands, this same story would become graceless.I think it's quite lovely how everything comes together, though perhaps the strands are arranged a little too widely at the start which accounts for the confusion this book sometime causes readers at the beginning. Even though I cried this time around I'm somehow less touched by this book now then as a teen. I'm glad I read it at just the right time; the impact a book has on you is definitely based on when you read it in your life. Sometimes a book speaks to you more, depending on where you are in life. Jellicoe Road no longer speaks to me as deeply as it did when I was its target audience but I'm happy it once did.I think a lot of what separates me now from as a teenager is it's harder for me to unabashedly love things.I'm dropping the rating from 5 to 4 stars since it no longer qualifies as a favorite for me, even if it once was. It's still a good book.",4,default,"['style-voicey', 'structure-interesting', 'prose-skilled', 'literature-young-adult', 'i-liked-it-better-as-a-kid', 'pov-first-person', 'genre-contemporary', 'literature-of-australia-new-zealand', 'prose-nice-passages', 'setting-small-town']"

I usually read speculative fiction or historical, usually with a romantic twist or two, and normally with a happy ending. This book had some of those elements but what it mostly was, was a beautiful tale of friendship, love, hardship, grief, growth and death.Set in a small country town in rural Australia, Jellicoe Road begins somewhat confusingly with a first person narrative of a young girl watching her parents die in a car crash. I say confusing because although this narrative is first person, this is not the main protagonist of the book. The only way you figure this out is at the beginning it says it is set 22 years later, but the main protagonist, Taylor, is only 17.Nevertheless, once you sort out who's tale you are listening to, the initial dreamy sequences seguay into a lovely tale of three different groups of children fighting territory wars that the adults know nothing about. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing deadly about these wars, it is merely a way to make the life in the country a little more exciting, and you find out in a series of flashbacks (not really flashbacks but too complicated to explain in a review and I don't want to spoil the revelations) who created the territory wars.Taylor is a young girl without a mother. She was abandoned at age 11 at the Seven Eleven on the Jellicoe Rd. She was taken in by Hannah, who is also a kind of house mother to the girls in her boarding house at school. Taylor has several issues. She witnessed a hermit kill himself when she was 14. She cannot relate to any of the girls in her house and she has repressed most of her childhood memories.She has been voted in as head of the students at her school which means she is the one who must devise the strategies in the territory wars. In the beginning she is finding it hard to relate to her schoolmates and she has to ward off coup attempts as well as all the incessant questions from her Year 7s.The best thing about this book, I think, is the growth of Taylor as a person. She starts off the book as a loner who has weird dreams to someone with a large circle of friends and family.This book made me cry, it made me laugh, it has some of the best rounded out characters of any I've read, be it a small character or a main one. I heartily recommend this one to everyone.",4,default,"['audio-book', 'aww2012', 'set-in-australia', 'young-adult', 'read-in-2012']"

The story begins a bit confusing but begins to explain itself as the tale progresses, weaving an intricate narrative of past and present. The story is real and raw in its heart breaking emotions, and includes hints of the magic and the wonders of life that we can never fully understand but should always take time to appreciate.The cast of characters in Jellicoe Road is well-developed and filled with amazing and heart-wrenching backstories, though it almost seems ridiculous how much tragic background stories can exist in one book. Even so, the characters stir emotions as they come to terms with their personal histories and how that’s shaped them into who they are and who they want to become. Taylor, the main character, is stand-offish and resentful of the world around her, but as she begins to open up and regard each person around her with more understanding, the result is a beautiful story of growth and finding good in the world; no matter how bad things may or might have been. Adding in an interesting collection of friends, adults, and a wonderful love-interest, the characters move this story and provide a lot of its beauty.The writing is powerful and captures raw emotions and feelings not easily expressed with expert detail. Marchetta’s characters are believable if not a bit much, and the story progresses elegantly as Taylor and those around her change for the better. Jellicoe Road is a marvelous story that tells of life, loss, and the strength of human spirit, a must for any fan of contemporary or coming-of-age tales. ",4,default,[]

How Hannah disappeared suddenly, leaving Taylor mentally stranded, unable to cope with the 'wars' between the Cadets, who is lead by Jonah Griggs; Taylor has a past with him, and it's not good! the Townies and the School, which happens every year.Hannah left a manuscript of writings she had been doing over the years, and Taylor decided to work her way through it. She found things she wasn't sure she wanted to know...sometimes wondering if she should stop reading, as it was becoming more difficult to confront her own story, wondering about her mother, not knowing about her father. When we meet the characters in this book, from the Brigadier and Chaz Santangelo, to Raffy and Ben, we get to know them all, and feel their pain.

It was fascinating; a serial killer, a lost, dead brother, two forgotten children and a war that was supposed to be a game.

She becomes the leader of the kids at the home, and the home is at war with the Townies and the Cadets. Throughout the book, mysteries are revealed, romance is sparked and wars are resolved.

Marchetta did an amazing job of capturing that sense of infinity that is just built into some friendships, and the yearning for that sense of simplicity was just ingrained everywhere. I love how this book is a twister story: it starts with all these loose threads and begins to wind them and twist them tighter, and tighter, until everything is just woven together.

I spent the first several chapters feeling mostly disappointed, but also frustrated, because I really wanted to love it and I wasn't sure that I did...love it, that is.Taylor was such an unlikable character that was full of annoying teenage angst. She almost came off as spiteful and petulant. I couldn't understand her, or the strange world she lived in. At first, it didn't make much sense, and I was trying to grasp all the pieces of the puzzle that were being thrown at us, bit by bit. The townies and the cadets and all the houses and this battle that the three groups were caught up in, each led by one character. Taylor being one, Griggs, and Santiago.Then there's this whole other story being told about 5 friends, an accident that brought them together, and a life that they lived together. It takes a while to clarify that this back story is important and directly connected to current events. Then there are Taylor's dreams of a boy in a tree, which also don't make any sense. So that whole set up was quite confusing for me, and hard to follow. However, once the pieces started to come together, and I started to understand and see the bigger picture and connect all the dots...well, I found it to be heart wrenching and incredibly beautiful and amazing. I loved the relationship that blossomed between Griggs and Taylor. I loved the friendships that were created, the bonds that formed, the different set of characters and their quirks. Once the story was over, I felt it leaving a mark, and it stayed with me long after I had finished it. The only reason I wasn't able to give it 5 stars was Taylor. Even though I sympathized with her and rooted for her, I found her so annoying. Her sudden bouts of irritability and crabbiness and the way she'd sulk like a child were frustrating, and although I understood where she came from, it didn't mean I was OK with the way she treated her friends and loved ones.Otherwise, a wonderfully told story, with so much beauty and tragedy intertwined.",3,default,"['2019', 'own']"

Luckily I was warned that the first part is exactly that and they told me to just keep reading and things would soon start to make sense. They were right. This novel by Melina Marchetta is without doubt very well written and the whole confusement in the beginning is actually part of the charm. Why haven't I given it an even higher rating? It may seem that I'm contradicting myself, but I don't think I would have continued reading without the warning that the beginning is hard to understand. The characters are very well developed though and once you get an idea of the whole situation the prose and plot just suck you right in. If you like realistic fiction and don't mind a confusing beginning, On The Jellicoe Road might just be the perfect read for you!Taylor was abandoned by her mother on the Jellicoe Road when she was eleven and ended up at a boarding school. When she was fourteen, she decided to run away and try to find her mom, but she was tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now she is seventeen and the leader of the school's underground community, having to lead the annual territory war with the Townies and the visiting Cadets. This year the Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, a guy she has some history with. When the only adult Taylor trusts, Hanna, disappears, things get even more complicated for Taylor... Now she not only has to make sure they don't lose any more territory, but she also wants to try and piece together the clues Hannah left behind. What is the real history of Jellicoe Road?The beginning of On The Jellicoe Road didn't completely convince me, but the rest of the story more than made up for it. The prose, the characters, the plot and plot twists... Melina Marchetta used those in a way that once you are past the confusing part, you just can't stop reading. I will probably try to do a reread at some point, since I will most likely enjoy this read even better the second time around. If you like the genre, I would definitely recommend this one; just remember that it may take a while before you can fully understand what the story is about. (hide spoiler)]P.S.

Hannah is her only real adult family member and as a result, she feels extremely close to her; however, Hannah up and leaves the boarding school without explanation. Taylor is beside herself with worry; plus, she is the leader of her dorm in the territory wars and is very reluctant about the whole thing. To make matters worse, Jonah, a boy she has history with, is back in town and is the leader of another group in the territory wars. While all this is going on in the back of her mind Taylor is still worried about Hannah and her whereabouts. Does it have anything to do with her mom? Melina Marchetta's puzzling and award winning novel, Jellicoe Road, took me on a wild roller coaster ride and didn't let me go until the story's final page.Ok. So. I am not going to lie. I pretty much loathed Jellicoe Road for the first one hundred or so pages. I wish you guys could have heard my inner monologue. I reminded myself of my students when they first encounter Shakespeare. I was saying things like, ""Huh? Territory wars? Is this a dystopia? Am I in Maze Runner right now?"".......""Wait. What's this part in italics?"" .......""How did this win the Printz award? There's so story, really."" ........""Am I even comprehending what is going on here? What the heck?"" Needless to say, I was extremely confused. Since Marchetta is a new-to-me author, I had a hard time trusting her in that the story would make sense as I continued to read. Thanks to fellow bloggers, I was told to hold on and keep going. To me, it was like a bad workout. I didn't want to continue, because it was hard and I was tired, but afterwards, I was happy I ran that extra mile and felt pretty good about it.Taylor's story is interrupted several times with another story about five teens from the past. At first, readers will have no clue what is going on, but as you read further the teen's story is interwoven expertly into Taylor's. As a reader, you must have patience with this as you have NO prior knowledge concerning this what.so.ever. Don't get me wrong....I like a little mystery and confusion in my books, but this was more like 100 or so pages of not knowing anything.On a positive note, Marchetta is a brilliant writer. I was shocked by the second half of the book, because I didn't think she could really ""fix"" the mess of the first half. However, she proved me wrong. The puzzle came together and I definitely had that ""A-HA!"" moment when everything made sense. I can honestly say I've never read a story like Jellicoe Road. It is very unique as is Marchetta's writing style as well.But here is what is on my mind: Yes, Jellicoe Road is beautifully written, but I wonder how many teenagers will actually stick with the first half of the book? I know many of my 8th graders would probably give up and put it down, because most like to be sucked into a story from the start. In fact, many bloggers said that had to reread the book or pick it up again at a later date in order to get through it. Hmm.... To me, this aspect of Jellicoe Road takes away from the reader's overall enjoyment. So all in all, do I feel Jellicoe Road is well written? Yes. Do I feel that it's an interesting puzzle of a story? Yes. Is it life changing as many claim it to be? No, not for me, but that doesn't mean I won't be picking up her other novels in the future. I plan on checking out Saving Francesca and Finnikin of the Rock, because I can't deny that Marchetta is a talented writer",3,default,['ya-realistic-fiction']

The opening is too confusing and the framing is badly done. I only kept with it because of all the glowing reviews. Still, there are things that should have been fixed before this went to publication.Follow this if you can...""Jellicoe Road"" is about 17 year old Taylor Markham who lives at a boarding school yet spends her holidays with Hannah who Taylor thinks works for the school but really doesn't. If there's a connection between Hannah and Taylor in terms of blood or legal guardianship, Taylor doesn't seem to be aware of it. She only remembers her mother dumping her in town when she was 11 and has amnesia about most of the events of her childhood including that time when the local nut shot himself to death in her presence. Also, Taylor's never seen a therapist for any of this which seems incredibly neglectful on the part of both her school and Hannah.Got that?Okay, Taylor has just been elected as the leader of the School Kids who, every year, wage some kind of 3 way war with the Cadets and the Townies. They can do this because the teachers, who are occasionally referred to, never make an appearance. The boarding school kids also do all their own cooking which I found odd. Teenagers aren't known for making great dietary choices plus this seems an open invitation to give everyone food poisoning. Interspersed with all this are Hannah's stories about 5 kids from 22 years ago who were in a horrific car accident, became best friends and had a bunch of adventures but then one of them disappeared and another one got pregnant and two of them fell in love but couldn't be with each other and oh, once they built a tunnel but that might just be a myth and...You see the problem here? Also there's a serial killer running around but none of the adults thinks that's important. I'm glad I finished this book but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",3,default,"['fiction', 'strange', 'young-adult']"

Taylor our protagonist is appointed leader of her school's secret army and is abandoned by Hannah, one of the only people she trusts. She must fight for her territory against the Townies and Cadets while in emotional turmoil. Her peers question whether she is capable of leading them, especially because she clearly has a past with one of the opposing community leaders, Jonah Griggs. Taylor must uncover what has really happened to Hannah, find out whether she can ever trust Griggs again and piece together who she really is. Marchetta has a beautiful writing style that keeps you guessing to the very last chapter. She pieces together her story with fluid twists that are a pleasure to unfold. Her characters are believable and have distinct personalities which is suprising since this book has a massive cast. I loved the segments of manuscript that was written by Hannah woven into the story as it gave us a small yet insightful look into the past. Taylor was a good protagonist and I really feel like we went on a journey with her, at times she wasn't likable but I sympathized with her story. I didn't like the secrecy much and it fell flat at times especially because I don't think it was necessary for Taylor to go through what she did just to get answers about her family. The rivalry was a little silly too, it was obvious that these were just normal kids who wanted to get along deep down and it was bizarre to me that this tradition had gone on as long as it had. I really liked the ending but unlike others I didn't get that emotional, I think Taylor got all the answers she needed and I didn't think it was sad, to be honest I was quite happy for her. The story was wrapped up nicely and I liked that there was hope for Taylor, Hannah, Jude, Jonah, Raffy, Chaz and Jessa.",3,default,['favourite']

Couldn't breathe. This is worth re-reading. More thoughts soon.***UPDATE***Full post at It's A Wonderful Bookworld.On The Jellicoe Road is one of those books that comes highly recommended by my friends at the book club. And I understand why. It talks about timeless themes of friendships, belongingness, and family, and of how relationships thrive despite having to go through grief and loss.This book was my first Melina Marchetta and I loved it. As what most reviews say, reading On The Jellicoe Road feels like being confronted with a puzzle with a hundred pieces to put together — you start excitedly but a few pieces in, you are tempted to ditch the project and just do something else, but then you still trudge on because you see a piece and you feel that this might be a part of a very pretty picture. Little by little, as you go along, the picture gets clearer and clearer until you are almost done, putting the very last few pieces, and you feel that the effort and the journey were all worth it. The final outcome takes your breath away, you sit back and gaze upon it a few moments, reliving the memory of how you finally got to the end.After I was done reading, I had to reread the first few chapters — the ones which made no sense the first time I read them — because I want to relive the moment and preserve the scenes in my mind. It is no surprise then that though it’s been more than a month since I finished reading, the emotions it evoked from me are still fresh in my memory. The wow moment at the end was absolutely mind-blowing and bittersweet.Continue reading here.",3,default,"['ebook', 'favorites', '2014-books']"

When I first started reading I felt confused and I didn't get what's the story about. But, after the first couple of chapters I started to get attracted to it. I really liked the story and the main character –Taylor- as well, of course there are many main characters not just her, But the story is from her POV .So to summarize the whole idea without spoilers –which is hard- we can say that it starts with Taylor, a teenager who's in Jellicoe school which consists of six houses. Taylor was left by her mother 7 years ago In this place and she's been taken care of by a woman called Hannah. But this place, where Taylor is, have its traditions. The traditions are that the school students, the Townies and the Cadets -who come to camp every year in this area- are to have wars. This is all according to an old purple book that no one knows who wrote it. This purple book includes all the rules about the war between the three factions. However, at the beginning of the book, Taylor gets chosen to be the leader of her school in this war and she's given the purple book. But as the war goes on and as the deals are being made….. everyone is finding out new and important information that are related to the past. And the info is very important to Taylor and others for a reason. So throughout the book there are so many secrets which are going to be known. So many mysteries that are going to be solved. And you really are not going to see it coming. I'm sure anyone who'll read it is going to enjoy it.",3,default,"['favorite', 'thriller', 'reviewed', 'fiction']"

I loved how this book affected me, hours after I put it down each day. I was constantly dreaming up possible answers and connections to all the intertwining stories, or smiling to myself as I recalled the sweet romance developing alongside this mystery. While reading the book in class during SSR, I kept wanting to put the book down and say to someone beside me, ""Whew! Can you believe it?!"" (Don't worry. I resisted.)But the beginning. Dear GOD, the beginning is horribly confusing. Too many names, too many story lines, too many obscure references to odd inventions of weird kids. I'm quite grateful that I pushed through, but I've no idea why I did. When I gave it to a student today, I gave her the warning/encouragement: ""The beginning is beyond confusing. I totally expect you to ask me some questions after the first few pages. Hopefully, it won't frustrate you the way it frustrated me. I promise, the rest of the book is worth it."" With great trepidation, I watched her deeply furrowed brow as she dug through the first two chapters. I braced myself for a tantrum of helplessness. But finally, she looked up with a sigh and said with a smile, ""Okay, I'm confused."" I sat beside her, answered her excellent questions, and she dove back in for more.

Vas enterándote de cosas que al principio no entendías y poco a poco ibas descubriendolo todo junto con la protagonista y eso fue otra de las cosas que me gustaron, que lo ibas averiguando junto a ella.Me parece una historia sencilla a la cual la autora supo enredar muy bien todo para hacerlo confuso e intrigante, pero que al final todo es tan sencillo. Me gustaron los personajes los cuales son realmente muy reales, con problemas como todos y debo decir que Taylor es grandiosa, es tan cerrada pero a la vez valiente dispuesta a obtener lo que quiere.

Cu o descriere mai degrabă interesantă, mi-am dorit să o citesc și să rezolv misterul. Până pe la jumătate, n-am înțeles absolut nimic, iar dacă eram întrebată despre cum este lectura, spuneam doar că nu știu. Pentru că nu știam. Pur și simplu nu empatizam cu personajul și nu îmi dădeam seama încotro duce acțiunea.Povestea este despre Taylor, care este părăsită de mama sa pe șoseaua Jellicoe pe când avea doar unsprezece ani. Acum, la șaptesprezece, ea este responsabilă cu căminele de la Școala Jellicoe. De când se știe, are aceste vise ciudate, cu un băiat trist care stă într-un copac și care îi vorbește. Dar Taylor este destul de pragmatică și nu își lasă sentimentele la vedere, căci pentru ea ar fi un punct vulnerabil. Printre atribuțiile sale se află și menținerea teritoriului comunității din care face parte. Dintotdeauna a existat un război între școală, Orășei și Cadeți, fiecare parte dorind să-și protejeze teritoriul și să nu-i lase pe ceilalți să depășească granițele. Practic, toată povestea se leagă de această luptă, ceea ce mi-a fost destul de neclar. De ce ar scrie cineva o carte doar cu scopul de a arăta cum se războiesc niște adolescenți pentru niște poteci, copaci, râuri și alte asemenea? Dar apoi mai e și Hannah, un fel de mentor al lui Taylor, care locuiește în afara limitelor școlii, și care dispare în mod misterios, lăsând în urma ei un manuscris format din pagini amestecate, fără început și fără sfârșit. Acolo, ea vorbește despre o tragedie care a adus împreună cinci tineri. Totul pare ireal, nelalocul lui, căci fiecare indiciu duce către niște vieți care au existat cândva. Și, cu toate că nu vrea să se arate atașată de femeie, Taylor se simte din nou părăsită și nu încetează din a crede că i s-a întâmplat ceva lui Hannah.Reîntâlnirea cu Jonah Griggs, conducătorul Cadeților, o trimite pe Taylor înapoi în trecut, când cei doi au avut ceva în comun. Cu toate luptele lor pentru putere, nu pot nega că între ei există o văpaie. Am crezut că nu voi regăsi deloc dragostea în această carte, dar a existat în fiecare filă, sub toate formele ei. Ascunsă, căci iubirea e exact ca o nestemată. Și abia atunci când răsare, poți să respiri ușurat .Povestea a fost amețitoare, m-a făcut să mă încrunt, dar mi-a smuls și zâmbete. Am decis să depunctez pentru faptul că nu m-a prins din prima. La final, totul s-a legat într-un mod precis și nimic (absolut nimic) nu a rămas nebifat. Ca un puzzle căruia îi lipsesc exact cele trei piese ce schimbă absolut complet imaginea. Și tare m-am mai bucurat de ea.",2,default,[]

Every word is carefully chosen and has a special purpose for the story. Melina Marchetta is a super talented storyteller, and I’m looking forward to reading more books by her. My main issue with Jellicoe Road is that you have to be extremely focused while reading, because every detail is important. It might not seem like a big deal while reading it, but then 150 pages later it’s suddenly of great significance for the story. (view spoiler)[Such as the postman being the serial killer.

ONCE I did realise the two timelines and who was in them I really started to enjoy myself, there is so much grief and just pain in this book, in kids lives. There is also a lot of awesome friendships, of student relationships, and loves. Love is a big part of this book, holding back love, ""forbidden"" love, the family love your not sure you should feel, the love that you don't or can't let yourself feel.I really loved the relationship between Gregs and Taylor they felt real, they fought, they had real problems and it wasn't all star gazing and picnics. The one standout in the audio is the narrator being so aussie, the writing along is super aussie as is but she really brought the aussie to life for me. After becoming so used to american and english narrators it was really cool to be hearing someone who sounds like myself telling a story that I could imagine perfectly. There's drama, mystery, disaster, sadness, bad parents, dead parents, sad kids, angry kids, and a whole lot to love in this book. ",2,default,"['contemporary', 'standalone', 'young-adult', 'oz-ya']"

Hands down. I feel overwhelmed. I’m sad and I’m happy. You know, after reading a book you sometimes wonder how it would’ve been different if something changed about it, or how you would have wanted it to be some other way. This is the story where I want nothing to change. I love it how it is. It’s a story I’ll never forget.When I started Jellicoe Road, it took me some time to get into the story. I was confused as to how the two stories were supposed to be related and it was mainly because I couldn’t read more than a few pages at a time. When I finally got into the story, I admit I had predicted some things but I don’t mind it at all because it felt like the author wanted me to know. Taylor had it figured out herself so it’s not as if she was some dumb, stubborn, moody protagonist. She did get on my nerves in the beginning. She pushed everyone away and had so many issues that I got angry on her at times but later, reading the story, I sat there feeling choked up with my eyes burning and trying to push back the tears because I was sitting around everyone reading the book and I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. Marchetta has such a beautiful way of writing a story. She is really a great author and I’m kinda shocked that it took me so long to discover her work. I felt everything that Taylor felt. It’s been sometime since I fell in love with the characters of a story. I adore everyone in this book. I love Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz, Jude, Taylor, Jonah, Raf, Chaz, Ben, and almost everyone else. Marchetta so beautifully manages to make every character she has mentioned in the story involved. Everyone is part of the story, unlike some authors who manage to bring up so many unimportant characters that are not even related to the story and are just made up and just as suddenly, simply gone. I can’t even imagine how it would’ve been for kids who became orphans in just a matter of minutes and how it became the turning event in all their lives. How that one accident took everything away from them and then gave them so much in return. To even imagine what Narnie, Webb or Tate had to go through, is like feeling someone crushing something inside me. I get very emotional when any character’s parent dies and in this story there is so much loss that I kept staring at a wall, blocking my thoughts listening to other’s talk around me, so that I don’t lose it infront of everyone. Every character in this story is significant and everyone is so different and each one of them has to face their own personal demons but when they are together, they simply enjoy each other’s company. And to have a relationship like those guys is something that can make anyone envious. Figuring out everything with Taylor and being with her on the roller-coaster ride of emotions was such a journey! I love her character. Truly. She had been through so much and she tried so hard to never get attached to anyone and tried so hard to hide emotions when she could hardly keep them in. She was so strong and even in her vulnerability, she did not fail to amaze me. She was broken but she held herself for everyone. I loved her relationship with Raf and Ben and Chaz and most importantly Jonah. Jonah and Taylor were perfect for each other and it’s been so long since I’ve loved two characters in a relationship together. Jonah knew how to act around her when she lost her temper. He didn’t sugar-coat anything and he was on her face and wasn’t scared of her like the others. He knew how to deal with her mood tantrums and in the same way Taylor was everything for him. She gave him a reason to survive and she understood him just as he understood her. *squeeeeeeeee* I feel giddy thinking about them together. Gee, I feel so girly. Anyways, if I start writing about the things that made me depressed or that I particularly liked, I would end up writing everything. So, I’m going to keep it short and say that it’s a story to know, a story to read, a story to remember, and a story that will make you cry with sadness as well as happiness. I loved the pacing, I loved how there were two stories and how those two stories were related together. I think I deserve a pat on the back for not bawling my eyes out and believe me there were moments when I would have just done that if not for the company. I have an urge to re-read it all over again and I will. Soon. The starting was shaky and the war seemed to be a frivolous issue but when I was in high school I remember having the same kind of rivalry with girls and guys of other schools for no reason..only cause it was. So, I guess I can see that. Also, Jesse knowing about where the tunnel was to save her life and Chloe's seemed unlikely.

I started before falling asleep and then I picked it up the next morning and could not put it down until I was finished. Now, that may sound strange when I tell you that I almost didn't finish it after reading the first few chapters. I think I was just too tired to deal with the way it was written. It's sort of a puzzle at first, trying to decipher what was past, what was present, what was dream and what was reality because the author set it up in such a way that everything becomes a slow reveal. I love a good mystery and while this is not a mystery in the traditional sense of ""whodunit"", it is a very mysterious book, full of hints and teases. However, I found those hints to be very tiresome at first. So, I put the book down for the night and picked it up the next morning, thumbing through to see if I'd like what was to come, looking for answers to some of the questions that wouldn't leave me alone. I skimmed and found myself sucked into the story so that I would skim a little further still, before fully becoming invested. Finally, after much skimming, I went back and started over, reading passages that I'd missed through my first read, until finally I finished the entire book.I don't normally read books that way but I think the skimming really helped me stick with this book and I am so glad I did. I almost took it back to the library, unfinished! It's a very moving story, though like I said a little confusing at first. I couldn't figure out what this whole Townie vs Cadet vs ""Us"" thing was. Just stick with it, it'll all make sense as you go along. For better reviews of the actual book, read some others around here because this isn't so much as a review as a telling of how pulled in I was by the book once I gave it a chance. Let me leave you with the opener, though. One of the most tragic and sucked-me-right-in openers I've ever read.""My father took one hundred and thirty two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, “What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?” and my father said, “Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand,” and that was the last thing he ever said.We heard her almost straight away. In the other car, wedged into ours so deep that you couldn’t tell where one began and the other ended. She told us her name was Tate and then she squeezed through the glass and the steel and climbed over her own dead – just to be with Webb and me; to give us her hand so we could clutch it with all our might. And then a kid called Fitz came riding by on a stolen bike and saved our lives.Someone asked us later, “Didn’t you wonder why no one came across you sooner?”Did I wonder?When you see your parents zipped up in black body bags on the Jellicoe Road like they’re some kind of garbage, don’t you know?Wonder dies.""",2,default,"['zzza-team', 'z2013', 'friendship', 'contemporary-fiction', 'family', 'library', 'relationships', 'young-adult', 'zmarch-2013']"

I am also tempted to say that she bullied me into reading it. But I won't say it. Because after Tanja read a few books that I recommended her, it was about time that I gave Melina Marchetta, an author Tanja swears by, a try. And trust me, Tanja knows her stuff. Don't ever mess with her. Don't ever doubt her. Because one point that is absolutely clear to me now is that Tanja will recommend books that will make you cry and in the end, those are the best books. It wasn't easy for me to get into Jellicoe Road. The story is confusing as hell, and there were times when I had no idea what I was reading but I just kept reading because, 1) I had to do this for my girl who 2) kept motivating me to go on with it. But even if I didn't have reason number two, I would have still continued reading because Melina Marchetta created magic with her writing and just the flow of words had me wanting to turn the pages. The confusing shift between past and present was difficult to understand at first, but once I got the connection between the two, it became incredible. I guess with books like Jellicoe Road, it's not so much about understanding as it is about feeling. And I felt. I am unable to pinpoint exactly what I felt, but I felt that pull in my heart that made me want to hug the characters. It was towards the last 15% of the book that I really got into the story and started feeling, but that's okay, because those last few chapters were so damn stunning. So even though 85% is huge, I forgive it, because the last bit was where everything came together, all dots were connected and life went on. So to conclude, I will just say that Jellicoe Road is difficult to understand and confusing to read, but you don't you dare give up, because there are very few books that bring tears to your eyes, and this is one of those books. While I do not love this book as much as Tanja and Glass do, I still want to thank them both for making me read it. You girls owe me now. But first, thank you. Thank you for making me read this heart-breaking yet fulfilling story about what matters the most- family and roots. Don't forget to check out Tanja and Glass' reviews of the book. P.S: There is so much more I wanted to say, but for now, this should be enough. ",2,default,[]

Un lugar al que todos pertenecerían y anhelarían estar. Un lugar en el camino de Jellicoe

 Taylor Markham tenía once años de edad cuando fue abandonada por su madre en el camino de Jellicoe. Ahora, con diecisiete años de edad, Taylor no sólo es la nueva líder de su dormitorio del internado, sino que también va a descubrir muchos secretos sobre su vida antes de llegar a Jellicoe, sobre todo después de la persona que la cuidaba, Hannah, desaparece de repente de la escuela sin decirle nada a Taylor. En medio de todo eso Taylor se encuentra con su antiguo novio, Jonah Griggs y sospecha que Jonah sabe más acerca de ella de lo que ella misma sabe. Ahora, Taylor debe descubrir la verdad sobre el abandono de su madre y el paradero de Hannah. Y lo que va a descubrir sobre su verdadero pasado cambiará su vida para siempre.Melina Marchetta crea una historia misteriosa que rodea el pasado de Taylor y como afecta su estado actual. En realidad en el principio, hay muchas piezas de información que son como un rompecabezas que tienes que ir encajando mientras vas leyendo. Por cada capitulo que leía era como ""¿y a donde se supone que me lleva esto? ¿que paso con Hannah? ¿y que hay de la mama de Taylor? ¿y quien se supone que ese niño?"" Me gustó el personaje de Taylor Markham aunque hubo momentos en que su actitud agresiva hacia los demás me molestó, puedo identificarme con ella en la forma en que le resulta difícil confiar en las personas después de que su madre la abandonó y que Hannah, la persona más cercana que tenía a una familia, de pronto se fue. También me gustó mucho la relación de Taylor con Jonah Griggs, Raffaela, Ben, y Chaz Santagelo ya que fueron grandes amigos para ella, y sobre todo me encantó la forma en que estos personajes trataron de ayudar a Taylor con sus problemas de confianza y como le enseñaron el verdadero significado de la amistad. Ame la forma en que Melina Marchetta localizo esta historia en Australia. La manera en que describe los lugares, por ejemplo: el camino de Jellicoe y el Árbol de Las Plegarias. Los fragmentos del manuscrito de Hannah, donde se cuentan las historias de Webb, Narnie, Tate, Fitz y Jude fueron mis partes favoritas del libro. Eran desgarradoras y conmovedoras, aunque en el principio no las entendía. Cuando todo empezó a tener sentido descubrí lo muy importante que eran esos fragmentos en la historia. Melina Marchetta es definitivamente una de mis escritoras favoritas. Y espero con ansias leer otro de sus libros.

I loved it from about page 175 or so on. I hadn't read any reviews or summaries before I started, I just bought it because it was on sale and had a pretty cover. Sometimes I do that. Sometimes I find treasure. Sometimes I find trash. I'm willing to take the risk. Having said that, I thought the book was set in the future and was somewhat dystopic when I first began. It wasn't.Taylor, our narrator attends a boarding school and her classmates, ""Townies"" and ""Cadets"" participate in some sort of war. I thought this was an actual war and that there would be dire, possibly even fatal, consequences to these skirmishes. When I finally realized the war was just a game these kids played for six weeks of the year the rest of the story fell into place. I was able to understand what was going on, get to know the characters and realize that the reason the story kept changing, and I often felt lost, was that sprinkled throughout Taylor's story is the story of five other kids in the past. Ah ha!Taylor was abandoned by her mother at the tender age of 11. She has always kept others at arm's length, been hesitant to show emotion and comes across as a bit of a bad ass. At 14 she attempts to run away from the school and find her mom. Her path and a young boy's, Jonah, meet up and their journey ends in what she feels is his betrayal. He calls home for someone to come and get them just before they reach where she thinks she needs to search. She doesn't know the true reasons he makes the call and when she and Jonah encounter each other three years later she has a hard time dealing with it. The story is about the loss of, and eventual reunion of, family. About establishing roots and knowing the history those that came before you. There's also romance, and praise the Lord, hallelujah, it's a healthy romance between teenagers. Marchetta writes these teens as difficult, angst-y, rude, snarky and touchy. In other words just like the teenagers I live with. They are not manipulative, overbearing, physically or mentally abusive and they allow each other to be who they are without attempts to change that or rule over each other's lives.I enjoyed the last part of the book so much(once I figured it out) that I may need to go back and reread.

Kuigi see noortekas mulle väga meeldis, siis tahaksin nüüd veidi žanrist irduda. Lubasin ju aasta alguses, et loen rohkem erinevaid raamatuid!Melina Marchetta nimi on goodreads-is ja raamatuteemalistest tumblr-ites korduvalt silma jäänud, kuid eelmine tema paljukiidetud romaan ""Saving Francesca"" mulle nii väga ei meeldinudki. Seevastu ""Jellicoe Road"" jättis mulle üllatavalt sügava mulje.Ema hülgas Taylor Markhami, kui ta oli 11-aastane ning sellest ajast saadik on tüdruk õppinud internaatkoolis, kus ka paljud teised lapsed on probleemsed. Näiteks on seal mitu süütajat. Neiu üritas ühe korra ka minema joosta, kuid toodi tagasi. Igal aastal tulevad kooli lähistele telkima Kadetid ning toimuvad sõjamängud territooriumi üle. Taylor valitakse oma kooli esindama, kuid tal on ka teisi muresid. Üks vähestest täiskasvanutest, keda ta usaldab, on kadunud ning neiu ihkab teda iga hinna eest leida. Vastuseid otsides leiab tüdruk aga vihjeid oma enda mineviku kohta.Mulle meeldis raamatu müsteerium, mis küll poole pealt juba ilusti välja joonistus, kuigi Taylor ise oleks võinud ka asjast veidi varem aru saada. Selliseid saladusi ei oleks tohtinud tema eest õieti hoidagi. Samuti tundusid põnevad sõjamängud, mis küll veidi muu loo kõrval tahaplaanile jäid. Veidi nooremale lugejaskonnale saaks juba luuramiste ja vallutuste põhjal väga nauditava loo. Territooriumitest rääkimise juurde oleks muidugi ilusti passinud ka kaart. Ükskõik, kui probleemne ja murtud oli peategelane, siis tegelikult oli lugu positiivse alatooniga ning keskendus leinale, lootusele, sõprusele ning sihikindlusele. Raamatut lugedes tajusin, kuidas halvast saab sündida hea. Lõpu poole liikudes tuli küll rohkelt kurbust ja poetasin isegi paar pisarat, isegi mitte nukrusest, vaid lihtsalt olin Taylori loost liigutatud.",2,default,"['ajas-nutma', 'armastan-kaanepilti', 'ilukirjandus', 'lemmik', 'lugesin-inglise-keeles', 'armastus-romantika', 'inspireeriv', 'kool', 'müsteerium', 'noortekirjandus']"

The first chunk of the book introduces Taylor. She pushes people away, is more interested in being alone than not and, in fact, rarely pays attention to anyone who happens to be around. Sound like it might be boring to read? It kinda was. It’s disjointed with little dialogue and the protagonist doesn’t go out of her way to endear herself to the reader. But it’s all in such a way that made me wonder why.And then it picks up. When a leadership position falls into her lap, Taylor takes it on grudgingly. She doesn’t rely on anyone and definitely doesn’t want to be relied upon, but the alternative means falling under someone else’s rule. The stories that she’s never understood from her past confront her more and more as she’s forced to work with others. It’s a little heartbreaking when Taylor doesn’t seem to notice that others need her as much as she needs them. During all the time that she’s thought she never had family, it’s revealed to have been quietly and steadily building itself up around her. It snuck up on me. Suddenly I was enmeshed in the lives of these characters and I was glad that they belonged to me for a little while. The story doesn’t rush in revealing itself and the confusion becomes alluring. It’s almost morbidly fascinating how one tragedy can snowball and affect so many lives. I love the idea that you create your own family, and that people can belong to each other in so many ways and for so many reasons. Like I said, I’m a little disappointed that I won’t get to experience reading this for the first time again.And, bonus, I have a new song to add to my musical rotation. I don’t know if I would have loved its ‘80s goodness without the book or if the book has imprinted itself onto the song in my head, but I’m digging The Whole Of The Moon by The Waterboys.",2,default,"['favorites', 'i-bought-it', 'library', 'favorite-characters']"

First off, a large portion of the beginning I listened to the audio version. I wouldn't recommend this. The reason for that is definitely not because the reader was bad, as a matter of fact she was excellent but there are quite a few instances where Taylor is reading Hannah's novel and it's extremely hard to follow. In the book, these parts are indicated by italic print, making it obvious it is not Taylor's narration that is on center stage. In the audio version until you know there even IS a novel that Taylor is reading, it makes a confusing scenario even more so. So much happened, so much information was provided at the beginning of the book... but while I was reading those parts, I was too busy saying to myself; What the hell is going on here??? That maybe I could have paid much closer attention and gotten more out of it. There were so many ""A Haaaa"" and ""Holy shit"" moments later in the book that I felt like I robbed myself a little by not paying closer attention earlier on in my reading. I think as many ""a haas"" as I got out of it, I still missed quite a few of them. I rated this book 4 stars which to me is a good book. The only reason it didn't rate 5 stars or an ""excellent"" read was because it took so freaking long to get into it. I seriously was hanging on by my finger nails and the encouragement of my GR friends that the book was worth sticking out. It totally was. It's going to make me double think the next time I DNF a book. I will be rereading this soon, and I'm predicting when I experience Taylor and her friends the next time around I'll be bumping my rating up.

I don't know how she does it! Her books always seem to start off confusing, this one wasn't any different, and before you know it you're sucked right into the story like nothing else in the real world matters. I was almost halfway through and was going to give up on this because it was just too confusing, but I went on because I have read so many good review, and oh my I'm am SO glad I kept going!Marchetta's characters feel so real, by the end of the book I feel like I know them and could text them to catch up and hang out. It's hard to tell you exactly what was going on in this book, so all I will say is read this NOW! Or you could wait until the movie is released, there's no knowing when it will come out so you should just read it. My only problem with books being adapted into a movie is that I hope they can capture the chemistry between all the characters.My only issue with this book (other than the confusing beginning, which made sense by the end) was the mystery behind Taylor's background and who her father was. I slowly guessed what was going on, which if you've read my reviews before you will know I hate when I guess things before they are revealed. But Marchetta was good at keeping little things secret and didn't reveal until later, so she kept me guessing a bit. Because of those small faults I give this 4 stars.

Well, it surprised me anyway. I'd heard that it was good but that it wasn't everyone's favorite of books. But I LOVED this book. My one critique was that the beginning was hard to follow. Marchetta jumps right into the story without explaining much of the backstory or who the characters are. So it takes a few chapters to get into the groove of the story. But as you read, you learn not only how she has formatted the story, but begin to unravel the mystery that is the backstory of the characters. She drops you into the middle because she wants you to discover the beginning. The way she weaved the story together was, in my opinion, brilliant. It made a contemporary story into a mystery. And I really enjoyed how the once sworn enemies became best friends.I will say that I felt the Territory War was a bit underplayed. It was such a giant priority in the beginning of the novel, and just disintegrated. I expected to have more fights with her other leaders, more ""battles"" for territory, and more war games between the Townies and Cadets. I really loved that everyone became best friends, but the huge war that was so important at the start of the book just wasn't a big deal shortly after.All in all, a wonderful book. I'm glad I pushed past the first few chapters so I could really understand and love this book!",2,default,[]

I didn't realize I signed up for an emotional read until I reached two-thirds of the book. The premise tackles about territory wars between three factions: the Townies, the Cadets, and Jellicoe High School's underground community. But more than that, the novel explores the back stories of the factions' leaders and the adults around them, thus, unfolding two tragic stories about love, friendship and family. The fight for territories was intriguing, until that storyline got dumped midway (because it has, unfortunately, served its purpose) to focus on Taylor's quest of finding her mother and her guardian, Hannah. It took me a while to catch up with the characters, but it wasn't hard to fall in love with them as soon I got to know them. I love the sexual tension between Taylor and Jonah early in the story, but it fizzled out midway because it got a bit mushy for me at some parts. I also love the characterization, especially on Taylor and Jonah. They are two broken, vulnerable teenagers hiding behind their tough-looking persona, and I love how the author explored and explained their back stories. They are not your ordinary strong-willed characters. There were dull, predictable moments, particularly on the latter part of the story, but the epilogue stabbed me in the heart and left me aching for the characters involved.",2,default,"['young-adult', '2015', 'romance']"

The first half was tedious, boring and very put-downable. I didn't like the author's writing style. It kept bouncing back and forth between the story of a girl living at a boarding school and a story of five friends. It was horribly confusing as it wasn't explained until later on that the story of the five friends happened in the past and was being read from a manuscript in the present. The worst part of the first half has to be the ongoing war between the kids in the boarding school, the kids from town and the cadet school. They fought over paths, fields, tree houses, etc., and these weren't arguments, they were beating each other up and taking hostages......and once you got into the second half it all started making sense. Every person mentioned in the first half became important in the second half. Everything and everyone was connected. I even cried at the end and that NEVER happens, well pretty much never.This is the story of family, and the lack of family, and the lengths people will go to for their family. It's about the beginnings of friendships that last a lifetime. It's about secrets. It's one of the best young-adult coming of age stories I have read. ",2,default,[]

I can see why it won all of the awards and is so well reviewed, but for the first half of the book I was very confused. There are two storylines (an italicized manuscript and the main character Taylor's POV), alternating between past and present, lots of characters and I got frustrated trying to piece it together. But then I read reviews and they all said the same thing about being lost for the first 150 pages so I kept going. I'm SO glad I did. Everything fit together beautifully in the end and all I could think was ""wow."" The story is well written, multi-layered and original. (I went into it only having read the blurb and knowing it was YA fiction, and I think that's the way to go). It's a mysterious story about friendship, abandonment, guilt, grief and forgiveness. I thought the love story with Jonah was very well done and the setting and characters were unique and well developed. I'll reread it now that I know how the pieces fit together and will check out more of this author's work. PS - My only other criticism is re: the territory wars (there seemed to be too much emphasis on them for the first half and I still have questions about them).",2,default,[]

When she was seven, Taylor was abandoned by her mother, and four years ago, Taylor tried to head for Sydney to find her; but Jonah, who was accompanying her, caused their trip to be prematurely stopped when he made a phone call and the Brigadier came to collect them. Taylor has never forgiven him.During the unfolding of Taylor's story we are also given snippets of the story of 5 children who lived there 20 years ago, by way of a manuscript that Hannah is writing, and we are gradually given clues to help us see who they are now and what happened to them. Those snippets aren't written in chronological order, so the reader must be alert. Their story together began with a car crash that killed parents, so they also have abandonment and misery to contend with.The whole is told within an elaborate ""war"" that Taylor's school, and the Cadets and the Townies all follow for territory, and within a heart-warming (and sometimes heart-breaking) story about friendship and love.

Wait, my eyes are still shedding tears.Ok.This is a story of intertwined lives from the past and present. A touching story about love, family and friendship. I have to admit that the story-telling was very confusing. It was about halfway through the book when pieces are starting to fall into place. I felt goosebumps whenever I read the italicized words. I craved for those stories; so I can fully understand the past that leads to the present. I didn't mind that I've already predicted who's who early on because the real story is how our main character, Taylor Markham, discovers it. Suddenly, she's unravelling events from the past that is connected to her present. Every bit of her journey is heart-warming and, at times, heart breaking. I cried while reading the 'other' story and much more towards the end, when everything is finally revealed, in place, and understood.I will recommend this book!

The characters are complex and I actually cared about them, which is a rare thing with some of the books I've read lately. I would recommend this book to adults as well as teens. Older adults may find the School, Townie, Cadet war storyline a bit difficult to get into at first, but the story soon becomes more about complex relationships, harsh realities, identity, love and much more.

This, though. This one is something else.I read this book in approximately four hours. How do I know? I started it on my lunch hour, and finished it at 8 pm, and I worked from 12:30-4:30. The four stars is deceptive; I loved the heart of this book. LOVED. This is a terribly sad book. And yet, it avoids Hopeless Town. That's a talented touch. LOVE. Let's get it out of the way now: I have no use at all for the territory wars plot. It seems more like a vehicle to make a book out of what might otherwise have been a short story, or perhaps an extremely clunky reverse parallel plot to the 80s territory wars starting? The main past characters get the brunt of the trauma. (view spoiler)[ Jude reads truest to me. He feels the outsider, and does what he is told regarding not telling Taylor or Jessa who they are or why he is around them because he's afraid Hannah and Tate will push him out otherwise. He handles Hannah with kid gloves because he can't bear to lose her. Hannah I can't quite figure. She is deeply, deeply messed up, and with good reason. To me, I can't see why she doesn't tell Taylor who they both are, but screwed up people do screwed up things, and her fear of losing both Taylor and Tate if she disobeys (how would Tate find out??) Tate's orders probably keeps her silent. And Taylor clearly describes how erratic Hannah's behavior can be with her--Hannah probably can't find her balance point in that relationship, thanks to...well,everything. Good lord, the trauma in the past of Hannah and Jude dwarfs the trauma in Taylor's past, and that takes some doing. (hide spoiler)]Though of course, there's plenty of sadness to go around! Having someone fall to pieces in your arms is a profound experience, and the recognition of that might be one of my favorite things in this book. (view spoiler)[ As Taylor rightly points out to Hannah, that's why things are so intense between Taylor and Jonah. It's also why things are so intense between Jude and Hannah, though they are adults and usually keep it under control--that breakdown after Webb's death happened longer ago, too. Having weirdly intense and fast-moving relationships is something of a thing in YA lit, but Taylor and Jonah have earned it, as far as I'm concerned. They did this thing when they were 14, and three years evidently elapse without them meeting again (still not clear on that; Taylor never mentions letters or phone calls once, which--editor's mistake? And for how easily Jonah appears outside her window, it's difficult to believe he stayed away the intervening two years he was in the vicinity.). Nevertheless, that connection you have with someone you saw emotionally stripped to bone never goes, and once that was out there there's no question of why this has to be so intense:  ""How does Jonah Griggs get to be a ten? He sits on a train with me when we're fourteen and he weeps...self-hatred pouring out of him like blood from a gut wound in a war movie...I am the holder of the grief and pain and guilt and passion of Jonah Griggs and as we sit huddled on the floor of the carriage, he allows me to hold him...he takes hold of my hand and links my fingers with his and I feel someone else's pain for the first time that I can remember."" Is that angst, or is that just another word for a way that emotional intelligence is born, how intuition can rise? The syntax in this scene (in the book in general, but this scene is the one I have to hand) is so fine: he allows me to hold him; he sits on a train with me. It would be easy to write this scene with slightly different words and lose the meaning of it altogether.  (hide spoiler)] Neither Taylor nor Jonah have connected with people much if at all until this moment, and that's what it's all about. That's the power of this novel. Connection. It's what they both want more of, and don't quite know how to get. There's a lot in this novel that I feel I can't criticize because I haven't lived it. Taylor calling her mother ""Mummy"" after all this. I've watched that parent-child bond go so many ways in my work-world, and it's one of the more mysterious things I've seen. Jonah being as functional as he seems to be, with his history behind him. I have a friend who shares some elements of that history, and he's shockingly functional too. People, we are strange and wondrous beings. And after all the horror that this novel bleeds, all the intensity alternating with the useless border wars non-plot, it still got me, with this: (view spoiler)[ ""He takes her hand and draws her to his side. They don't say anything as they walk with me, but I've been here before, so I know that words aren't needed. I remember love. These two people taught it to me and when I see Hannah lean over and kiss Jessa's sleeping head, I know that for the rest of my life, no matter what, Hannah and Jude are going to be there. Like they always have been. And tomorrow I'll need them more than ever."" That and when Taylor realizes that when she wants more, she needs to go and get it. Take that power, girl.  (hide spoiler)]On a lighter note, (view spoiler)[the whole exchange about the see-through nightie cracked me up. That was brilliant. Spot-on.  (hide spoiler)]And last but certainly not least, I loved how these characters saw each other through their eyes. That sounds obvious, but when Taylor looks at Griggs on the station platform she sees fear; when Jude looks at Narnie he sees her sorrow, and, later, her seeing everyone they've lost; when Taylor looks at Santangelo she sees his questions. I don't think we do this enough. I'm not talking about lovey-dovey gazing into each others' eyes; I'm talking about what amounts to using your limbic system, what some call intuition. It feels like magic and intuitive people are regarded as mystical, but as Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes so rightly states, ""I didn't know; I saw."". This book deserved its Printz medal. Well done.*update 4/16/18 on reread*YOU GUYS! It's Ben the Violinist from The Piper's Son, plus bonus guitarists!!! I love it when authors weave characters in and out of books!

If I were prone to dramatics, I could imagine my sighs would have been heard from the boundaries of the school to the town down below.The question begs to be asked, “Why the flashlights?” Turning on the light next to my bed would have been much less conspicuous and dramatic. But if there is something I have learned in the past five years, it’s that melodrama plays a special part in the lives of those at the Jellicoe School.So, JELLICOE ROAD. This story isn’t quite what I expected. For one thing, there’s a touch of magic in it, though it’s a contemporary YA, not a fantasy novel. For another, it reads very much indeed like a dystopian novel, although it’s not that either. Plus, there’s a definite mystery wrapped around the main story. Here's the back cover copy:Taylor is leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs - the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother - who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.The moving, joyous and brilliantly compelling new novel from the best-selling, multi-award-winning author of Looking for Alibrandi and Saving Francesca.Which is all very well, but as you can see from the opening, the protagonist, Taylor, is dreaming about a boy when the story opens. This particular dream, and others, continues to be important through the story and particularly at the end. This is what I mean by a touch of magic.Also, Jellicoe School? The codified warfare between the students of the school, the townies, and the military cadets who spend a few weeks camping nearby in the summer . . . very dystopian feel to this element of the story. The adults don’t know what the heck is going on, even though the war gets pretty violent at times. No actual fatalities, but if the kids hadn’t gotten this all straightened out, I can hardly see how they would have avoided real trouble eventually.The story is not exactly about sorting out this war thing, though. It’s about Taylor getting her own life in order by working out her relationships to her friends at the school, to Chaz Santangelo (one of the Town kids) and most of all Jonah Griggs (leader of the Cadets). It’s also about Taylor sorting out her relationships with her mother, who abandoned her at the school years ago, and Hannah, who has been more or less acting as a mother to her since.So it’s a relationship story. Obviously. Except it’s really two stories braided together, because the story of what happened to Taylor’s mother and Hannah and their friends seventeen years ago is the frame story and also braided through the current-day story. Working out what happened to that earlier group of friends gives JELLICOE ROAD a definite mystery element as well. So it’s complicated.My overall reaction: It’s a pretty dark story. I, unlike whoever wrote the back cover copy, would not have picked the word ""joyous"" to describe it. What happened seventeen years ago is horrifically grim, and as we find out more about the aftermath, it just gets grimmer. There is a happy ending to that story . . . sort of . . . but the best thing you can say about the contemporary story line is: Taylor and her friends may go through some tough times, but it is *nothing* to what happened to the older generation. And everyone does wind up in a better place at the end than they were in at the beginning, but . . . moving, yes, but joyous?I actually disliked this story at first. I picked it up originally because of Chachic's recommendation, Brandy's comments, and Maureen's review and because the back cover copy sounded interesting. Two of the linked reviews (links now correct; sigh) refer to the confusing beginning. This is true, but it wasn't a problem for me. What was a problem for me is that at the beginning, Taylor is incredibly self-absorbed. I know she was going through a lot, but I really disliked her. Then a friend of hers at the school calls her on that and from that point on, she starts to grow into a much more likeable person. By the end, I liked her a lot. The bit where she tells off Sergeant Santangelo for being angry at his son, Chaz, is one of my favorite scenes. I really enjoyed seeing Taylor grow up and seeing the relationships between her and her friends deepen. Plus, Jonah Griggs! His backstory is *grim*. His background with Taylor is . . . also grim, in unexpected ways. But how he and Taylor figure out what happened in the past and work out their current relationship – all that is pretty much perfect.So, yeah, by the end, I loved this book. Since I was in the mood for emotionally intense contemporaries, I quickly picked up a couple more of Marchetta’s: SAVING FRANCESCA and THE PIPER’S SON.",0,default,[]

It was strange. It was emotional. It was full of epiphanies. It was about belonging, about love, and about heart ache. It was about a girl looking for her mother. It was about depending on others. It was about depending on yourself. It was about Tate and Webb and Narnie and Jude and Fitz. It was about the past and the present and the future. It was about family. It's a very emotional story and at times painful to read because you see these characters that are good people make horrible decisions and become so lost that they don't even know who they are anymore.

And it's all Melina Marchetta's fault...Taylor Markham lives at Jellicoe School. She's the head of the school boarders, leading them in a secret military-style battle for territory - in a teen war between the boarders' faction, the Townies and the Cadets that has been going on for generations. Ever since her drug addict mother abandoned her at a 7/11 store a few years back, Taylor has been happy to keep people at arms length. After all, by maintaining a tough exterior, it's easier to hide the hurt. And you can't be abandoned if you don't ever let anyone close enough to abandon you.Yet Taylor feels added responsibility pressing down on her. The disappearance of the closest person to a mother, Hannah, is a betrayal. Before long, however, Taylor moves past her fear of abandonment and worries instead that perhaps Hannah did not disappear of her own accord.Desperate to find her before its too late, Taylor's only clue is a manuscript of Hannah's, holding a story that feels less like fiction and more like a memory. And Taylor starts to wonder...what is it exactly that people are hiding from her? And will she live to find out?***If you can't already guess, this book is ENTIRELY mysterious. I guarantee that unless you have some crystal-ball-prophetic power you will be wondering what the hell is going on with anything for at LEAST the first third (it took me two-thirds, because I'm slower than most).The opening scene in Jellicoe is horribly shocking and angelically beautiful in equal doses. From there the reader is faced with a confusing jumble of people's names and places and actions, with no real way of being able to connect the dots. This is one of the few books where I feel the 100-page rule does not apply, make it 150 pages instead and you'll suddenly understand why I told you to hold on.This book has been called ""distinguished"" by other book bloggers and I would completely agree with the description. Marchetta has a crafty way of writing that is both mature and accessible.But what I feel this author truly excels at is her ability to create authentic teenage emotion. The relationships between these characters are so real - you feel the thrill of the first hand-touch of two (future) lovers, the fond feelings underlying an insult traded between friends, even the absolute desolation a teen feels when they realise their Innocence is being gobbled up by the Experience monster at an alarming rate. ""No one understands us!"", they cry.But you're wrong! Melina understands.I had only read Looking for Alibrandi by Marchetta before reading Jellicoe. I thought Alibrandi was a happy, bright little thing, until the book suddenly smacks you in the face with Death. In comparison, though, Jellicoe feels like a school excursion to the local haunted graveyard. Yep, On the Jellicoe Road is all about the ghosts, baby. Ghosts of the past, ghosts of the future, ghosts in dreams and ghosts in trees - pick your favourite flavour of ghost, they're all there. The book's also got this cool military thing going on - the school feels a bit like army barracks and when you pair this with the smalltown, isolated territory, well, you couldn't be blamed for thinking theres a bit of a dystopian thread running through the story.I could go on for a long time about lessons that can be learned here - the book is about journeys rather than destinations, and there are themes of abandonment, and freedom, and the blame game in abundance. Even better for the peeps out there who love a dash of symbolism - there's allusions to such classics as to Kill a Mockingbird and Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, and it's totally open for reader's interpretation. I'm sorry I can't really give away more of the actual story, and I may have in fact confused you more, but believe me - it's all part of the master plan. And despite the hugely positive review I'm giving this book I have to come clean - I can't give this book five stars.Marchetta may be a whiz at writing, but she's a terrible surgeon. I feel like I've gone under the knife expecting to be dramatically altered yet healed - after all, my favourite authors have such precision! Instead I wake up to find that my brain thinks only of sad things. I want to curl up into the foetal position and never speak to the world again. This book deals with death, and then some. You can't say you haven't been warned!But hey, all in all, I am happy I read it *stifled sob* and I heartily recommend it *sniffle*. It's a fantastic offering from a fantastic writer and I know now that I'll just have to read Saving Francesca - I've heard brilliant things and it appears to be a lot of people's favourites of all of Marchetta's works... High Expectations, here I come!First though, I need a bit of time to get over this one. I'm exhausted. And I need to go wash my pillowcase.4 stars.A bit o' useless trivia: The original publication title On the Jellicoe Road was changed in the States to the simpler title of Jellicoe Road.

Basically, there is a girl named Taylor whose prostitute mother abandoned her at a 7-Eleven outlet on Jellicoe Road when she was a child. She goes to Jellicoe School (a boarding school), where the students there are involved in an annual territory war with two other factions of teenagers: the Cadets and the Townies. Once, when she was fourteen, she escaped to try and find her mother, but was found and brought back. In this story, unwanted responsibility is thrust upon her, along with unexpected friendships and a revelation of the past that culminates in a huge storm of a headache and a heartache.Let's begin with the not-so-good so that we can end this on a pleasant note. I felt that the romantic aspects of the book, while portraying a realistic(ish) view of life, served very little purpose. The history that conspires prior to the present setting of this story opens up a world of possibilities that I felt had the capacity to be explored and intertwined with the main story arc, but instead seemed as if it was mostly just there to build sexual tension. Don't get me wrong, it was effective, but didn't contribute much value to the plot. Also, the romance didn't even develop in a very realistic way: in fact, the rate at which it progressed was almost alarming, and I felt that it was just riding on the reader's anticipation to move forward without very much logical flow and sequence (ie. it was pretty obvious from the start who it was always going to be). This, for me, is too great a flaw to ignore in my rating and because of that I've very, very reluctantly knocked it down a star.The good thing is, though, that there is something so magically enticing about this story. A quarter of the way in, I still had no idea what was going on. In the initial pages, the reader is just thrown into a seemingly random segment of Taylor's life with absolutely no introductions to who on earth she is and what kind of system the people there operate on. That's not even counting the bits and pieces of a completely different story chucked in at funny intervals to throw you off. Everything is a blur and it's a chore to piece everything together and get a clearer picture of the whole thing from any bit of contextual knowledge we can get our hands on.But therein lies the magic: the subtlety of the language and the way the plot opens up so gradually is kind of like unfolding a mystery I didn't even know was supposed to exist. It was here that I begun to suspect everything and everyone, and as a result, well... the supposed ""plot twists"" near the end were not very surprising for me. Rather, I thought it was better as a gradual thing, because while the revealing was taking its time, I was busy shivering with anticipation and oh my goodness is this it is that what you're saying no it can't be no it must be but no oh my goodness you can't do this to me noooo, and by the time everything finally converged, I didn't feel sucker-punched. I felt dead.(sorry, I couldn't resist being a little dramatic)Nah, I don't actually feel dead. It's amazing because there is so much hope in the tragedy that is presented. There are sad moments and parts of what is revealed in the end are undeniably tragic and horrible, but there is so much good that's been done and so many lives changed from all these supposed coincidences. In the end, what you get is the reality of mistakes, but at the same time also, the value of friendship and looking forward.------------------------Edit: Wow after reading so many reviews this sounds so shallow and unbelievably lame.

For some reason, Goodreads-less me was unable to cross paths with it when I was closer in age to the protagonist. I had doubts when I first picked it up. It definitely took me at least six chapters or so to get into and want to know more, I'd read that this was the case for other readers so I just kept going with it. And it was worth it. It takes place mostly in small town present Australia, with briefer jumps back in time in the same location. It's as much about the place as it is the people, and the connections you build with both, especially through tragedy. I don't know why, but for a long time I had a strong opposition to reading YA fiction, even as a young(er) adult! When I was the same age as the protag (17) I tried my hardest to not wander into the teen section at Barnes and Noble because I thought I needed to read more serious works (I don't know where this idea came from...). I'm still fighting this weird book snobbery now but on a more subconscious level because I no longer care what people see me reading. (Well, I guess I have one little clue as to my nervousness. I went through a brief manga phase with my best friend in high school early on, and my Dad gave me the same talk his father had given him when he was still reading comics around that age- which is basically that you just can't anymore. To his credit, at the rate I was reading them and then buying more was probably becoming a little too expensive. But it definitely added to the anxiety of my book choices as it took some pushing on my BF's part to get me into manga in the first place! I've since come to realize that though my Dad is well read in his own exclusive non-fiction way, there are many things he won't experience from reading a little bit of everything. And it's taken me a while to see that not only is that okay, it's really good. Yesh, sorry about that extreme digression!) But because reading was usually a private pleasure for me, no one told me that not all YA is fluff. So, here I sit, once again amazed by another technically YA book, and ready for more. This review was more about me than the book I guess... sometimes that happens.  On the Jellicoe Road  has mystery, action and the perfect amount of romance. It made me laugh and cry (quite literally) and I stayed up until two in the morning to finish it. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had an unusually hard time visualizing the world, which is critical for me as a reader. There were brief moments when I could see it perfectly, but Marchetta did not put much time into describing the characters beyond vague descriptions and adjectives. While I do sometimes like to alter the appearances of characters I'm reading about (as a kid Hermione had glasses and you couldn't tell me otherwise), I like a foundation to start with. This also applied to the world in general. She really just jumps right into it without much explanation which can be effective in many cases but I think with this story I would have preferred a little more background. All in all, this book opened my eyes a little wider to the power of YA fiction, and I'm ready for more that also set the bar. Teen aisle at Barnes and Noble, I'm ready for you! I can't wait to gift this to my cousins when they're old enough and make sure they never fret over what people see them read (if I can get them off their ipads, yikes).

It seems I got, in some ways, what I was expecting, but not in the manner in which I expected it. There were place-names that I didn't recognize (although Sydney was at least familiar-in-name); I had some trouble picturing the landscape not because of the lack of description, but rather because I assume it would be different than the stock landscapes in my head; and I kept wanting the characters to speak in an Australian accent, and I couldn't keep that up for long, as I was too ""sucked in"" to the characters and story. These things, however, were not the things that kept it from being a typical YA book. ""I tell him stories. Lots of stories. About the Jellicoe School students and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney. I tell him about the war for territory.""This book is characterized by two intertwining stories, both of which center on the same geographical location and interrelations among the three ""factions"" represented in the story (the school, the local ""townies,"" and visiting ""cadets""). While I had to go back a few times to re-read the sections of one of the stories as I began to feel my way through the book, some of the connections started to become clear as I continued. This discomfort with the divergent stories ultimately became satisfying, as they unraveled and converged slowly and naturally. Many iterations of YA literature focus on a single ""misfit"" who ends up saving the world or changing the community. The joy of this story springs from the self-discovery of a number of seemingly normal-and-troubled teenagers, all of whom struggle with reconciling their own identities. Still sounds like a trope, I know... But there's more to it than one might expect from this type of book.The interplay between self-and-origin and self-and-groups leads the main character, along with the people around her, to question where, when, and how identity really develops. Can we be complete if we do not understand where we come from? What are the turning points that make us who we are? Marchetta examines these questions from different viewpoints with a tapestry of answers, highlighting the complexity of being human. With the obvious question of finding out the truth of her parentage and a recently-disappeared parent-figure, the main character finds far more depth of understanding through reading the other story thread, which eventually converges with her own. Through dreams and flashback, this book makes the reader re-examine the glimpses of memory, which are contextualized and reinterpreted through different eyes over time, to seek the truth of SELF. Are we a product of our experiences or the interpretation of those experiences? Can we understand ourselves if we do not understand the motivations of those who have hurt or helped us? Complex but accessible, this book is appropriate for teenagers coming into a realization of identity. It is, however, just as poignant and engaging to a mature reader who may be tired of ""typical"" YA fiction. The author does not ""dumb down"" the concepts or complex relationships to cater to an I-want-it-now teenage culture looking forward to the upcoming movie-version. But these action-oriented folks will appreciate the building of suspense, multiple conflicts and layers, and engaging story-line. It's a quick and endearing read that isn't always easy to put down at bed-time.",0,default,[]

I'm not sure if I love the audiobook as much. (text itself, 5 stars, audio, perhaps 4.5?)Melina Marchetta is my favorite author, and this book is the one that really cemented her place as my favorite. To me it represents another level of writing for her. The audiobook in some places enhanced the story, but in others detracted. Mostly because of awkward, dated interstitial music that did not enhance the mood of the story at all, but also, ant this is so stupid of me to say, but because when I'm reading the book to myself I don't always think about how it's set in Australia, but when I'm listening to it being read I can never forget that and it was, it was honestly weird? IDK I'm probably a terrible reader for saying that.Beyond the audio presentation I've never properly written a review for this book, I think because I probably wasn't on Goodreads when I first read it and this is the first re-read I can remember doing.It's not surprising to me at all, having read all of Marchetta's contemporary work, that the theme of family, and especially found and created families, is prominent in this book. It's one of the things I like most about her work. It was also more evident to me on this read through that many of the unexplained pieces of the book would possibly be shuffled vaguely under magical realism by readers.This is not an easy book, and its not a breezy contemporary, but it is a deep look at the people we surround ourselves with, the love we find in this world, and the ways those things shape us.I also really really appreciate that the dangers of a very co-dependent relationship are on display here. It's refreshing to see a book that challenges its protagonist not to make a single person her entire world. It's also nice that the characters are flawed and make very real mistakes, and that their relationships with each other can survive those things.I don't know, maybe it's indulgent to see the self absorption of teens have few negative consequences on the ties binding them to friends, family, and loved ones here? I'm not sure.Also a note, I'm too blinded by my love for this book to genuinely critique it. There are probably problems of representation and plot here but I'm not going to be able to outline them for you, sorry.Edited to add: Re-reading this book was so odd, first, it's been, well I pre-ordered this book and read it immediately after the US release so it's been 7 or so years since I last read it. Many many things stuck with me and the anticipation of them was fascinating, but the how of things being revealed, and the when, that didn't really stick with me. Thus something I was convinced had happened about 3/5 of the way through actually came right at the end and I completely for got how we found out who one of the characters was. It was a completely different experience the second time through, but just as wonderful.",0,default,['audiobook']

If there’s a novel that is given more GoodReads love than this one, I have yet to hear of it. Browsing the reviews for Jellicoe Road, I was bombarded with 5-star rating after 5-star rating, glowing review after glowing review. I’ll be honest; after all that, the synopsis could have been about a dancing chicken and I would have rushed over to Amazon to order it. (It’s not, don’t worry.)Taylor Markham is a character taken straight out of a Lifetime movie; she doesn’t know her dad and her rarely-sober mother abandons her at a 7-Eleven, sentencing her to a life at a boarding school and guardianship from the one and only adult in her life to ever truly be there for her, Hannah…until she disappears, too. As if that’s not enough to ratchet the melodrama up to a 10, there’s a tragic story of 5 good friends being told simultaneously, one that happened in the past and slowly answers questions about Taylor’s history.The beginning of Jellicoe Road is very confusing, going back-and-forth between both stories with little to no segue, and no idea of how they match up in any way but location. It took me nearly half the book to really get into the story, and those pages were spent terrified I’d be the odd-man-out yet again, shrugging my shoulders at an enormously loved book and stamping my pessimistic, Debby Downer 2 –or –3-star rating on it. Thankfully, the second half delivered on all the promises the first half laughed at, and I found myself totally immersed in a heart-wrenching story full of lovable characters, many with huge, realistic flaws.What makes Jellicoe Road work is how it deals with the melodrama it contains. With so many tragic events making up the life of one seventeen year old girl, this could have gone terribly wrong in less capable hands. Marchetta manages to make it believable and relatable, never pushing it over-the-top, or cheapening the subject matter. There are no static characters, no Big Bad Guy or flawless hero. Everyone reacts to and is shaped by the events in their lives. This proves to me once again that the most important thing in a story is its characterization, especially in contemporary novels.This is hard for me to rate because of the completely different opinions I had about the first and second half. Ultimately, though you do realize that the beginning needed to be as slow and confusing as it was to make the rest so powerful, I can’t give this the full 5 stars when it took me so long to begin to enjoy it. I do, however, highly recommend it to readers who like a little more substance to their YA, and don’t mind having their emotions put on a rollercoaster of ups and downs.",0,default,['2013-reads']

Finding family and love? Maybe? I was frustrated and confused through almost the entire first half. But then the pieces started to fall into place. With some serious orchestration and intricate plot weaving. Through to the end, which had tears rolling down my face while I sat in traffic listening to the audio. Characters - I don't really think I would have liked any of them in person. Except maybe the brigadier. He was the only character who seemed to have his act together. Everyone else was a mess. Narration was fine. Nothing to remark about. An overall frustrating read, that I ended up loving at the end. 4 1/2 stars. Lost a 1/2 star due to the confusion at the beginning. ",0,default,[]

It reminded me some of The Outsiders or Stand By Me, so if you've seen/read them, you may know what you are in for. It's written from Taylor's POV with some journal excerpts from Hannah. Taylor has had a rough life and knows very little about her dad and some of her past. I'm actually a little surprised at how little she remembers about her life before age 12, but since I had an ideal childhood compared to her, maybe that's the norm.Griggs is an interesting love interest, especially with what he had to deal with before even showing up at Jellicoe Road. At first he just seems like an intense guy with a bit of an attitude and a thing for Taylor. As you go along, especially near the end, you get to see more and more of the layers. I think I enjoyed his development more than even Taylor's.Chaz, Raffy and Ben are all great side characters. I actually like Ben the best and was a little sad that he's not involved as much as the story goes along. I do appreciate that there was not a love triangle, though.The journal entries by Hannah jump around a lot at first and it makes a lot of the story confusing. Add in Taylor's dreams, it can seem a bit crazy. If you stick with it, I hope you will think it is all worthwhile. You may have to reread the beginning again after you finish the book, though, to finish putting all of the pieces together. I loved Webb & Jude from the journal entries. Narnie, Fitz and Tate are OK, but I didn't really connect with them as much. (view spoiler)[ Though my heart really broke for Narnie a lot throughout the book.  (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[ I was very glad at the end when Taylor said that she needed time away from Griggs so that she knew that she could live without him. I was glad that Taylor recognized how Tate's dependency for Webb was really unhealthy and ultimately her downfall.  (hide spoiler)]This book has a lot of swearing, though I thought it fit in well with the book. I usually am annoyed by swearing in books, but in this one I didn't mind so much. (view spoiler)[ There are also 2 brief sex scenes which you may not want younger YA readers to read.  (hide spoiler)] I did think it was strange how little adult supervision there was for the teens in this book. The adults are there at times, but not too often. I would recommend for 15 or 16 and up. It could be a good way to discuss death, sex, drugs, redemption and/or abuse with your teen. If you ever read it, I would love to discuss someday.  I forgot to mention it's also a great story about redemption. Not sure I can tell you more than that without ruining the book.  ",0,default,"['library', 'mystery', 'ya', 'romance']"

She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs—the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother—who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.So many people have been telling me that I have to read this book and now I finally have. I wasn't sure what to expect going in since I've seen such praise for it and I didn't want to be let down. It ended up being an entertaining read and I really liked the characters, but I wasn't as absorbed into the territory wars as I would have liked to have been.Taylor, newly appointed leader of the kids who attend Jellicoe school, was the main character and one that was both intriguing and frustrating. She was going through a lot and trying to deal with it on her own, which led her to passing her responsibilities as leader off on other people. It left a lot of room for growth and she did obviously care about the school and the kids under her care.At first, the plot was a little confusing. It took a few chapters to fully understand who was who and what was going on. Once that was dealt with, it made reading a lot easier. There was a lot of discussion about the territory wars, which was Taylor's boarders vs the townies vs the cadets and each group 'owned' part of the land. There were ways to get more land, to lose land, etc but it never felt like a huge plot detail to me, even though there was a lot about it in the book.What I was more excited about was to find out what had happened to Taylor's guardian, Hannah, who'd disappeared and why the story of five kids from eighteen years old was so important. It did take a few chapters to get used to the switching between the story of those kids and Taylor's group but once I did, it worked really well. The more that was revealed in the story, the more it connected to the present.The writing was absolutely beautiful. There were so many quotable passages. The interactions between characters were all over the place, in a good way. There was fighting and laughter and misery and support and love. It was great and they were my favourite part of the book.",2,default,"['yabc-challenge', 'contemporary-challenge-2015', 'contemporary-challenge-ya-2015', 'contemporary-ya']"

First because before start to read this book I saw a lot of 5 stars and this book is pretty book dut doesn´t deserve 5 stars for me. First I need comment that the first 80 pages are incredible boring and the story not make any progress. And that is important for me. I was so close to give 3 stars for so many elements.Taylor who is this girl hat was abadoned by her mom she finds to Hannah a wonderful person that rescue her and practically saves her life when she was only a child. And this time I am not going to publish spoilers because probably one the best elements is the suspense.But I must confess that this book has strong points. The romance was interesting and the mistery was pretty good. I am sorry but I didn´t feel magical the secundary story just really sad. Probably something i din´t enjoyed was the fact all these campament rules I was annoyed to one point.“Hold my hand because I might disappear.”Anyway was a good book I cried a lot to the end for several elements.

Like many other reviewers here, I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a happening and had no choice but to find my own way by rereading some pages to try to figure out what was going on. But when the book finally started taking form, it became well worth the initial confusion. The novel follows two stories of two sets of teens from two different settings, but both are connected by tragedy. One is of the 17-year old heroine, Taylor Markham, who boards the Jellicoe School. Every fall, the “Boarders” fight the “Cadets”, military trainees who camp near the school for a few weeks, and the “Townies”, those who attend the school but live in town, participate in what is called the territory wars where they compete for various trails and buildings in town. In the beginning, she is elected as a leader of the “Borders”. She is highly respected in her faction, but is also known to be stubborn and hard to agree with. It is revealed in the beginning that she was abandoned at a 7-eleven bathroom at the age of 11 by her drug-dependent mother. She is picked up by her guardian, Hannah, who brought her to school on the Jellicoe Road where she works. The only memories she can recollect is sitting on a man’s shoulders, what her mom looked like, and a terrible shooting with the Hermit. The second story follows the tale of five teenagers whose friendship stemmed from a tragic accident. The novel continues as relations with the three factions develop, Taylor learns more about her past, and we out what happened with the five teenagers.The two storylines mixed with everyone seeming to have a “history” with each other was confusing at first, but to those who become stuck on unmotivated- don’t lose heart. Keep reading, because what awaits is nothing short of brilliant. I have to admit, Taylor was not a likeable character at first, but the story gives us insight on her past little by little, and the reader has no choice but to empathize with her. The story comes together in small but dramatic revelations that keep you on your toes. There is a lot about death, despair, anger, hurt, but also love, friendships, hope, and forgiveness. For a book that had so much emotion, Marchetta articulates it in a way that leaves you gutless. Other than the confusing beginning, this was a solid read that has a high recommendation from me.",0,default,[]

It's what I have to keep on reminding myself. It's funny how you can forget everything except people loving you. Maybe that's why humans find it so hard getting over love affairs. It's not the pain they're getting over, it's the love.”Marchetta weaves two stories decades apart together in such an impressive way! We have the story that Hannah has written about five teenagers who lived on the Jellicoe Road, they were each others family and all that mattered, and how they dreamed of getting out of Jellicoe Road. How fate had other plans. The main story is about Taylor, a seventeen year old who is now the leader of the Jellicoe kids in the territory wars. Taylor is just trying to survive. Abandoned at a 7/11 by her mother when she was 11, she doesn't have many aspirations for herself beyond surviving day to day. She's lost. And this is the complicated and beautifully wonderful story of how she finds herself. “As I walk back to the school on my own, I realise I'm crying. So I go back to the stories I've read about the five and I try to make sense of their lives because in making sense of theirs, I may understand mine.”“Is a person worth more because they have someone to grieve for them?”""Be careful what you wish for,"" he says with quiet menace, ""because I'm about this close to telling you to get the fuck out of my life.""I stare at him.""What do you want from me?"" he asks.What I want from every person in my life, I want to tell him.More.”As always, Marchetta has created an entire cast of characters that you will fall in love with. Her side characters are tenacious and crucial to the story, hardly feeling like side characters at all. And of course, the writing was gorgeous. Over all a really memorable story that I would recommend to anyone!I will definitely be reading it again, I think things will stand out even more then. “And then their voices stopped and their souls stood still and they ceased being who they had been. Because who they were had always been determined by him.”“And suddenly I know I have to go. But this time without being chased by the Brigadier, without experiencing the kindness of a postman from Yass, and without taking along a Cadet who will change the way I breath for the rest of my life.”",0,default,"['contemporary', 'beautiful-writing', 'young-adult']"

It delves deeply into relationships on all levels, with parental figures, siblings, friends, frenemies, acquaintances, mentors, the whole gamut. and in the end, it is about family, friendship, forgiveness, and the strength of human bonding. it also speaks of the influence that those around us have on the way we live our lives and view the world. in a way, this book gives me hope for humanity; yes, awful things happen, but people are resilient and can find strength in each other.there is so much heart and emotion locked into the pages of this book. (it's been a week or two since i finished reading, yet when i think back on it, all of the emotion comes flooding back). i can't count how many times my heart broke for taylor as she tries to navigate the world that surrounds her, but it's not just taylor for whom my heart breaks, it's narnie and jude, griggs; pretty much everyone has their demons that they carry.as for the plotline, there is slight confusion at the beginning as to what's going on with the different perspectives, but i picked it up rather easily. since the flashbacks/story are told out of sequence, i did end up going back and rereading those portions close to the end just to give myself a proper frame of reference (after everything was revealed of course). i figured out the connection between the stories earlier than i would have liked (and typically this knowledge will ruin a book for me because i prefer to be blind-sided) but found that it didn't bother me in the least. in fact, figuring this out made everything dearer to me, because i knew what some of the outcomes were going to be.characterization was really great. to begin with, there are a lot of characters, but none of them felt superfluous. each has their specific purpose and distinct, realistic personality; all are flawed, as they should be.really, really impressed with this book and hope to read more like it.",0,default,"['things-that-make-you-go-hmm', 'young-adult']"

It's gotten amazing reviews, and it was certainly okay, but it just didn't do it for me.I thought the beginning was convoluted. We start with a story, it's going great, then bam! New story with new people and new places and no word on what happened to the old story. It takes a bit of reading to catch on, and you do, but I thought it was jarring to jump back and forth with no context.We immediately jump into the Townies/Cadets/House wars but we're not told why. Maybe I'm unusual here, but I wanted to know why these 3 groups were fighting over land and taking hostages and literally beating each other up. I may have been able to get into the story more if I had this background information.The plot in itself was quite good, unusual. It set up a lot of questions that I wanted to keep reading to find out the answers to. Like, where is Taylor's mom? Is she dead? If not, why hasn't she come for Taylor? What about her dad? Why are the land wars going on? What happened with Griggs years ago?There were a lot of characters and Marchetta did a decent job of giving them their own personalities. Some of them could have used a little more rounding out, but nothing was a deal breaker.The dialogue was good, quite realistic. There were a few terms or expressions that I had never heard of. I assume they are common in Australia. They were not bothersome and added to the feel of the story.There was no sexy hotness at all, which kind of surprised me, as there were a ton of teenagers living in a boarding school with little adult supervision. But maybe I have a skewed idea of what boarding school is like... There were a few nice kissing scenes, and 1 sex scene that was tentative and sincere.The Sum Up: It took a long time for me to finish reading this one. Whether that was because of the length of the story, or because it just couldn't keep me interested, I had a hard time deciding. I was ready to give this 3 stars until the last 4th of the book when it became more interesting. I especially enjoyed the ending, which avoided being too sappy or clichéd.",0,default,['kindle']

It’s a touching story that follows Taylor Markham, whose trying to find the mystery of her mother. Honestly, this book is so darn good that it hurts to read sometimes because it’s so full of wisdom. I love Taylor and being in her head. Although, I wish there was a little more to her grief, I absolutely recommend this book. With the second time reading, everything makes so much more sense. The first time I read it, it was very confusing. Every review you will read about this book will confirm this. Since it’s confusing, some DNF this book, but honestly, I think you should just finish it. It’s such a beautiful journey of Taylor coming to terms with her past and the mystery of Jellicoe Road. I loved all the friendships in here especially the ones between Santangelo and Jonah, although they butt heads most of the time. Their friendship is one of those where they hate each other, but in the end, they both care about the same people. But seriously, the friendship is everything in this novel. Everything about this book felt so deep, alive and rich.And of course, JONAH. He is the best thing in this novel. SERIOUSLY. I own both the ebook and the physical copy and you wouldn’t believe how much I highlighted Jonah’s dialogue. He is perfect. One of the best male interests ever. Honestly, I wouldn’t hesitate to marry this guy. He comes off a cold, stand-offish kind of guy, but he’s really sweet and caring towards Taylor. And uggghhh, he’s the definition of bae. I absolutely loved reading this time around. And will definitely be re-reading this again in 2018.* * * * *Original ReviewOfficially found the love of my life: Jonah Griggs.

At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor's the reluctant leader of her school's underground community, whose annual territory war with the Townies and visiting Cadets has just begun.This year, the Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, and Taylor can't avoid his intense gaze for long. This is the same Jonah that Taylor spent 3 days with while she was running away trying to find her mother, and before the Brigadier finds her, and brings her back to her boarding school.To make matters worse, Hannah, the one adult Taylor trusts, has disappeared, and nobody will tell her where Hannah went. This is an amazing story that tracks not only Taylor, but also the past story of her mother Tate, and a group of 4 kids that were brought together by tragic circumstances. It interweaves both stories, and they finally come together for a nice ending.Taylor's character has alot of anger issues to deal with, but in reality, she's entitled to them. Her mother, Tate, moved her around so many times as a child, and told her she had different names each place they landed, that when she is finally abandoned at a 7-11, she realizes that she is alone. She can't remember her father, Webb, who died years ago, and who along with Tate, Narnie, Fitz, and Jude (the Brigadier). where the original pransters on campus.Marchetta has interweaven the stories between the two groups; the past, and the present, very well. You get a feeling as you are reading that the two will somehow piecing themselves together, and they do. The only negative was the mini sex scene between Taylor and Jonah.

You dive right into it and there are changing story lines and hostilities and lots of other things that are just a bit much for your brain to work out at first. I wasn't even positive that Taylor was a girl for the first third of the book. Once you sort things out though you can't stop reading.This was a beautiful and lovely book. There is just so much feeling and meaning behind everything that happens. My heart sat like a rock in my chest just waiting for something to happen. I didn't think anything bad could happen if a book started with so much death, but I knew better.Melina Marchetta wrote a heartbreaking novel. It's just written in a way that allows you to really get to know the characters and fall in love with them. I loved the little bits from Hannah's story woven in. We get to see little bits and pieces of these characters while trying to push Taylor forward in life. This book was fun and shocking and just all the good bits.I can't believe it has taken me so long to read this. So many people told me about how amazing it was and I didn't want to read it and have it be less than that. I was not disappointed. If you are one of those people who have been meaning to read this but haven't yet, set some time aside and devour this one.

The beginning was chaotic and confusing - so many characters to learn and two major story lines being told simultaneously. I had read reviews about this and knew going into it that I would need to try to learn each of the characters for who they were, and to not try immediately to figure out how (or even IF) the stories converged. I think this approach worked out well, though I did find it difficult to keep up with who was who and the little sub-stories that were told within these two main stories. (See, a bit confusing)!However, once I got past the initial 'who's who' feeling, I began to feel deeply connected to this book. I wanted to know how things would unravel. I could see the pieces coming together. I began to see the BRILLIANCE behind Melina Marchetta's writing. Her story-telling technique was spot on. Sure it was slow-going and a little difficult at first, but there's no question why this book won such a prestigious award. Overall, my favorite aspect of the story was how all these random teenagers came together. In each of the story lines there were 5 random kids who really didn't 'belong' together as a group of friends, but against all odds, they became the best of friends. Jonah was probably my favorite character. There was so, so much I wanted to understand about him. I had so many questions and I wanted to know WHY and HOW he would become a main part of the story. This book made me think about the characters when I wasn't reading. It made me try to figure out the plot line. I tried to weave it all together. Read. This. Book.

But Jellicoe Road is also a place of memories, and those memories are tragic, stunning, binding things that form the incredible roots of this novel. Everywhere on Jellicoe Road, memories tangle with the present, until you realize that the author has woven a stunning tapestry of generations, families, loves, and friendships that spans years. The connections are amazingly intricate and yet don't stretch belief in the slightest. The emotions felt are raw and real and beautifully human. The identities that are steadily revealed with keep you guessing and gasping with every page.There's the present-day rivalries between the Jellicoe School kids, the Townies, and the visiting army Cadets. There's Taylor's struggles to understand her parents' abandonment, her loving but distant caretaker Hannah, the school kids under her care, and the sharp-edged Cadet named Jonah with whom she shares a history. And there's the story of the five kids who used to live on Jellicoe Road, five kids brought together by a single horrific accident, who loved each other and Jellicoe Road with all their hearts and continue to affect the present in more ways than can be imagined.With so many facets, you'd think there would be things rushed or left unsaid by the end, but the author guides every bit of the story to a pitch-perfect conclusion; not sappy, but so pure and wonderful. Each character is so well-written, even the side characters. Completely and totally recommended.",0,default,[]

Rough start, smooth finish. This probably had a lot more to do with my frame of mind than the book itself. (I shouldn't start reading books when I'm hungry. Note taken.) I found the first third of the book to be pretty disjointed and confusing. I think that this was for a reason. Taylor is lost and confused, but as the novel goes on, Taylor becomes more certain and sure of herself, and the novel begins tying up loose ends that were quite confusing at the beginning. So, whether it was by design or it was just my hungry head getting confused, the novel does clear up as you go on. 2. The original 5 stole my heart. So the novel opens with a story of a family getting in a car accident. Then, flash forward 22 years, and we meet Taylor. No, Taylor is not in the opening series. But as I found out more about those 5 kids mentioned at the beginning, I began to wish they were my best friends. They are funny, and they really and truly care about each other. Once I realized how the book was playing out, I was eager to get more information about these mysterious kids. 3. It's just a good story. Did this story change my life? No, probably not. But overall, it's a compelling and intriguing story, and it kept me turning the pages and wanting to know what happens. I read this novel in 2 days.

On paper, things started looking up from there. But when you get a shitty start in life, it isn't that easy to trust people, open up to new friendships or allow yourself to fall in love. In  On the Jellicoe Road, Taylor learns how to do all of those things, while fighting a war that isn't a war, and while figuring out how her life is interwoven with that of The Five, a group of friends formed by the worst of circumstances, and torn apart by even shittier ones.On the Jellicoe Road is also a book that had me really confused for the first few chapters. I didn't understand what the whole war was all about. I couldn't discover the purpose of the unchronological flashbacks, and I kept feeling like I was missing something. But about one-third in, things started to make sense and I got caught up in Taylors quest to discover what she is all about. It's one of those books where you'll appreciate the first few messy chapters later on, because everything starts to make sense eventually, and you can feel really smart for figuring it all out. What I loved most about this book is how genuine everything feels. Before On the Jellicoe Road, I only read Marchetta's fantasy novels, so I didn't really know what to expect in this genre. But she definitely owns it. Rich, delightfully flawed characters that you can relate to, even if you're nothing like them, and a setting that makes you feel nostalgic for a place you've never been and will never visit.

A lot. But they don't have the same effect on you that it did on everyone. They didn't make you cry. Nor did they make you feel anything too deep. This is one of those books that you'll always remember fondly. That you'll think of as one of those books which gave you new perspective while you read it. Captivated you and gave you this sense of peace at the same time. Made you think that even though so many bad things happened there is after all some good too. And when you finish it, you get this strong sense of satisfaction even though the ending may not be your happily ever after type. In my eyes that is one of the greatest accomplishment an author can make. Ok so critically speaking, for the first approximately 25% of the book, you'll be wondering WHY IS THIS EVEN THERE ?? And feel a sense of mystery at the same time. Trust me, I about made a thousand guesses about what the actual plot is while reading the first 25% and my guesses ranged from the lead being in coma and imagining things in her comatose state of mind to her living in an alternate world where all the people she's seeing around actually being hidden aliens.

So many rich, deep, fully fleshed out characters and I really enjoyed that she didn't lay out the story matter of fact but kind of let you guess at it some. I really liked the two story lines going on at the same time, the one with the original five and then the present day stories had enough similarities to make it interesting but enough differences to keep it from being boring or feeling like I was reading it twice. I felt like the ending was a tinnnny bit rushed, from the part where the fire occurs. I was really appreciate of the twists in this story and how neatly they tied everything up, even questions like ""what was Webb thinking when he died"", and ""why do they keep mentioning that damn serial killer?"" were answered. While I did guess the majority of how this book would pan out (who was whose parents and that the brigadier was not who he seemed to be) I still thoroughly enjoyed the ride.

Which is odd for me, since my tastes usually run to fantasy instead of contemporary works.I thought the characters arced brilliantly in both mysteries that were unfolding. The movement in time between the two stories was perfectly timed and switching between them didn't feel cheap or contrived at all. They were both genuinely compelling stories that had satisfying conclusions.The only thing that I thought it loses points for was the fact that you aren't clear at first that the main character doesn't exist in both stories. So I kept trying to figure out the math of how the two could fit together, which took me out of the moment for a while at the beginning. But I carried on and once I figured it out found it utterly compelling.For some reason it reminds me of Kit Pearson's A Handful of Time, which is one of my all-time favourite classics. This is just a teenage, sexier, Australian story that is every bit as compelling and satisfying to read.

All the pieces of the puzzle fit together and all the unanswered questions were finally answered. What made me love this book aside from the slow pacing is that once you finish the book the story itself is so heartwarming and it's just something I have never read of before. I find the story unique and exquisite. If you've ever watched the movie Stand by Me (involves a group of close friends) I'm sure you'll throughly enjoy this novel! This book covers romance, death, family, and most importantly friendship. The strong bond between the faces in the photograph is out of this world, it's hard to find friendship like that these days and their simplicity on the values of life just made me mire drawn to them. Already mentioned above are some of the characters; all of the characters had a realistic touch to them. Every single character is outstandingly lovable.

I'd pick it up, I'd put it down. Weeks would pass. I'd pick it up, I'd put it down. A month or two would go by, and the same thing.

But ""etc"" married/Hooked up with Tate..that much I remember). Someone killed someone? Did the friend kill the other friend or was it the serial killer? No wait, I think I have it. So what we have is...My bad memory vs a somewhat confusing book...at least at first. But the book won me over, and by the last third I really couldn't put it down anymore. It all finally came together, and the initially confusing disjointed stories and characters wove together seamlessly into a rather beautiful story of yearning, redemption, forgiveness, love, and all that important stuff.

The beginning of the book was really hard to follow because there were two stories going on and lots of characters that weren't really described much - just named. And you have to read 50 pages until you get to the second principal character. But getting there does help sort the narrative out a bit, and it starts getting clearer from there. The plot of the book turns out to be much richer than I'd originally thought it would be based on my reading of the back cover (which I should have known, since the book won a Printz Award), and I was pleased and moved. There's also a strong female protagonist - but that's not very unusual in YA these days, is it? (Yay!) It's also nice that it is set in Australia, because so much of the YA genre comes out of the US.

She has different ways of telling the story and it keeps you reading. It wasn't paranormal, which is a nice break from what I've been reading. The characters felt real and I was sad to end the book because I wanted to know what happens to them throughout life.The bad: There is no setting at the beginning of the book which makes the first 60 pages really confusing. There are A LOT of characters to keep track of and how they are connected to other characters and other time periods.

The second group is told about in a story that the guardian of the main character has left behind that the MC reads throughout the story.There are no big surprises in Jellicoe Road, but Melina Marchetta's writing is strong enough that the element of surprise is unnecessary. The story exposes both the past and present for both groups of characters, with their stories being nicely interwoven, each dependent upon the other for the final resolution to come about.As someone older than the older group of characters being written about, I appreciated the way Marchetta handled the older characters, making them believable and sympathetic.

It's not uninteresting at the start. It's complicated and mysterious and you're convinced it's going to be feckless but it's not. It's so not! I recently read a book (The Scorpio Races) where it took 200 pages before I finally cared, even a little, about what was happening. It was a good book but a bit agonizing in the beginning. Jellicoe is similar only in that it might require 200 pages for you to realize you care but I promise you that you cared way before, and you didn't even know.

At first I was confused -- who are these voices speaking, and what do they have to do with anything? The main narrator isn't the girl from the excerpt on Goodreads? Why do these kids have a war going on? What year is it? Where are they? It took a while (probably half the book) for me to figure out a lot of this.

It reached me on a level different than most books. I am no stranger to the void that death can leave inside a person, but the emotions that Marchetta writes about are foreign to me. The characters are pretty complex, the emotions are intense and gripping. I actually felt for the characters, but they aren't characters who would need people to feel sympathy for them. It is kind of wild and disorienting.My favorite part though, and hopefully you won't think this is stupid, the fact that Marchetta does not make having sex for the first time this glamorous and amazing act.

Ang ganda ng istorya, the characters are very fleshed-out, they are very real, likeable and very remarkable. Nagsimula ang istorya ng may tone na parang competition ng teritoryo, fun and light YA novel but as the story progress, we are being given with much deeper plot revolving Taylor's life and the tragic story of these five friends from the past. These two stories, the past and the present, was perfectly executed up until I found out their connection with each other. Tears... I shed some good tears sa librong 'to.I love how this started in a fun territorial competition kind of way tapos nakita natin how each characters evolve, how each members of this three territories transformed into something heartwarming. I also enjoyed the settings of this book and how this community is very close-knit na parang magkakakilala ang lahat, sobrang nakakawarm ng puso. Parang isang comforting na yakap ang Jellicoe road sa akin, setting-wise and book-wise.Tama nga si Kat, ang ganda ng librong 'to!

Sou muito grata.First, I'm usually not cool with solving problems with violence, but it always made me smile when the guys started pounding on each other for the stupidest reasons. Then there's the whole mystery that is not really a MYSTERY, but something we don't know. Then there were the characters, the kids, then there was everything else, and I just love this to bits, there's no way I can love it more, seriously, I'm looking into my soul to find ways of giving it more love, but I just can't, I'm already giving it all. I feel sorry for the book I'll read next, because the contrast will be pretty appalling. (not really, though, because I'm going to read Lemony Snicket next, and there's no way i'll ever get disappointed in him, so maybe I just feel sorry for the book I read after that?

Y puedo confiar en un YA. (¡Queridos y alabados Young adult vengan a mí!)② Las reseñas que leí sobre esta historia, todas alabándola. (¡Gracias!)③ Que me fui 0 expectativas porque, primero: No tenía una p**a idea de la existencia de JR sino hasta hace unos 7 meses atrás, y yo me considero una amante y fiel seguidora del género, ja!. Segundo: es una historia que no fue spoileada ni nada. Lo que me hace pensar que quizás es porque no es tan popular, y si me estás leyendo justo ahora y no has leído Jellicoe road deberías corregir eso. YA.Lo que me encontré:① Lo que bautice el año pasado ―cuando leí Te daría el sol― como una joya: de los pocos pero buenos YA.② Una trama muy innovadora. En ningún momento sentí que fuese rebuscada, todo lo contrario, me resulto fresca y fácil de leer. Lo de Cadetes, paisanos y guerras territoriales. ③ La narración es ágil, sencilla y entendible. Puede que saltara de un momento a otro, pero eso sería en cuestión de escenas que hay algunas que me hubiese se alargaran más.④ Buenos personajes. Y no pensé que diría esto pero me termino cayendo bien Taylor, cuando deje de centrarme tanto en su hostilidad y la historia dejó de enfocarse (más allá de las 100 páginas, ugh) en los sueños y el llanto de Taylor, empecé realmente a disfrutarla. Y a los personajes dentro de la historia en esta historia son fabulosos. Me gusta que Melina Marchetta no se enfocó solo en Taylor y su vida sino que todos los demás tuvieron su participación y parte importante en la historia. Y eso es algo digno de alabar.Lo que me gusto:① La trama. ¿Ya les había dicho que me gusto la trama? Si te vas leyéndolo hazlo desde un primer momento por la trama. Es una delicia. Disfrútala, vívela, quiérela y súfrela como yo. Eso sí, que nunca se te olvide. Oh, la trama lo es todo. *suspira* ② Los personajes. Haría una lista bien grande porque en Jellicoe Road todos merecen ser amados. Solo personajes que crecen personalmente. En medio de tanto sufrimiento, devastación y despedidas se nota la manera en que Melina quiso reflejar el progreso de.cada.personaje.③ La historia dentro de la historia. La historia de Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude y Fitz que me ha tocado el corazón. ④ Jonah Griggs. 😍🔥🔥⑤ El sarcasmo. Sarcasmo everywhere. #YayMis relaciones favoritas:① Está bien, se podría decir que debería empezar por la pareja protagonista, pero de primer lugar no debía dejar de lado a Hannah (Narnie) y Jude que, aunque casi nunca fueron una pareja al uso, para mí son la mejor no pareja que he leído. Jude, se mío. ♥①.② La relación colectiva. La de Jonah como cadete, Santangelo como paisano, y la de Taylor como jefe de las casas; con ambos. Cuando poco a poco se va acompasando el conflicto y las guerras territoriales para ser partícipe de fiestas, aventuras, pasado y amigos. Ben y los hermanos del flequillo a quien los une el gusto por la música. ② Taylor y Jonah, que a pesar de basarse en un inicio por un pasado en común y luego lo que vino después, para mí siempre será una de las relaciones más lindas que he leído. Fue pausada, dulce, a base de gestos y silencios compartidos que yo, literalmente, morí de amor.③ Webb y Tate. Porque sin Webb y Tate no habría Taylor, y sin Taylor no hay Jellicoe road, y sin JR; no hay Jonah. #JustSayin ④ Raffy y Santangelo. Que si tuviese la oportunidad de meterme a la historia para juntar sus caras de una vez por todas, la releería para cumplir mi sueño realidad.Mis escenas favoritas:① El día que Jude llega por primera vez a JR y ve a Narnie, luego vuelve al día siguiente a sembrar amapolas y conoce a Webb, Tate y Fitz. Los que luego serían sus mejores amigos. ② Fitz, ese niño que llegaría en una bici robada y les salvaría la vida. ESA ESCENA LO ES TODO. Me pone triste su destino y luego recuerdo quien es Jessa y parte de la tristeza se convierte en felicidad. ③ Nunca quise tanto un camisón (y no tenerlo precisamente), ni le di importancia. Nunca quise tanto (y agradecí) que una protagonista causara un motín usara un camisón como Taylor, hasta que causo esa reacción en Jonah; viniera él toda sensualidad y dijera una que otra frase listilla que me hiciera fundir en un charco. No valí nada. Y ya no tengo ovarios. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥④ En la inauguración cuando Ben dice las razones por las que Raffy y Santangelo deberían estar juntos fue reveladora. Y de las mejores, ¡Bravo!Todo lo demás es el resultado de una de las mejores lecturas del año. Porque Jellicoe Road 
me ha encantado

1162022.On_the_Jellicoe_Road,1162022,On the Jellicoe Road,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/198025771,198025771,2011-08-13,5,Tammy,/user/show/3912806-tammy,"Disclaimer: This review originally appeared on my blog, The Book Fairy's Haven.How do you rediscover your sense of wonder underneath all the layers of grief, forgotten memories and fragmented pieces of history when all you have is a script that tells a broken story and a girl who has forgotten her past?I first fell in love with Melina Marchetta’s writing a couple of months ago when I read Saving Francesca. This wonderful author has a way of making the lives of her characters seep into your veins, filling your soul with a bittersweet ache that refuses to go away long after you’ve turned the last page. And with On the Jellicoe Road, it proved to be no different.In fact, I’d go as far as to say that this book proved to be an even better reading experience - such is the exquisite power of her writing.Not only that, but the book wrecked me in a way that I never, ever expected it to, which is why the first thing you should probably know before I continue, is that Melina Marchetta is the queen of bittersweet reads.Her books aren’t the conventional kind of reads that always leave you with closure; they’re books that leave you with a lingering void in your soul; it’s one that you’re not sure how to refill and one that you’re not quite certain you want to. But, for all of their poignancy, they somehow, by their very nature, also leave you filled with a hope that speaks of new beginnings and all of the blossoming opportunities that go hand in hand with it. And On the Jellicoe Road, is definitely one such book.Yet, it doesn’t make for an easy read.It’s not because it’s heavy and dressed in intellectual snobbery ( quite the opposite, in fact) but it’s because the book is like a puzzle; the pieces all fractured and fragmented, and arranged in an order that at first appears to make no sense.I know many have abandoned this book for this very reason, but here’s my advice to you: Puzzle pieces always start out with no structure, but when it starts taking shape, it transforms into a completed masterpiece.Melina’s On the Jellicoe Road?It’s not only a phenomenal riddle-like novel waiting to be solved by the reader, but it’s a reading experience that transcends its very own essence when the pieces finally fit together. The book starts off at the scene of an accident, and hooks you in immediately:
“My father took one hundred and thirty-two minutes to die.I counted.It happened on the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I’d ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of miles away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about time the four of us made that journey.”
These opening lines not only set the scene for a journey that will span over the course of twenty years, but also asks the following question posed by an integral character in the book (I quote): 
“I remember asking, ‘What’s the difference between a trip and a journey?’ and my father said, ‘Narnie, my love, when we get there, you’ll understand. “
I didn’t think of it then, but only when I closed turned the second last page, did I realise just how important this question would be. I also never thought that this book would have such a wonderfully, hopeful and heartbreakingly beautiful response to the posed question, nor how it would fit in with the theme of the book, which is why the impact of this book was all the more powerful for it.Divided into past and present, present-day focuses on Taylor Markham, leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. With her trademark devil-may-care, rebellious and tough-as-nails attitude, she reluctantly finds herself having to deal with boarding house issues, trying to negotiate her way around territory wars, which includes dealing with Jonah Griggs – who is not only leader of the rival gang, The Cadets - but also someone she’s had an interesting history with.Having been abandoned by her mother at a young age, Taylor rarely lets anyone in, and when Hannah, the caretaker and only person Taylor has ever learned to rely on disappears, the only thing she’s left with is a strange and unfinished manuscript which chronicles the story of 5 people who resided in Jellicoe years ago.Taylor knows that in order to uncover Hannah’s whereabouts, she’ll need to try and make sense of the manuscript. But with so much of her own story missing and being plagued by strange dreams that may be connected to the manuscript, she’ll need to finally confront all the memories that she’s been repressing and try to find the mother who abandoned her On the Jellicoe Road so many years ago.The manuscript Taylor tries to make sense of focuses on 5 people Hannah wrote about: Tate, Webb, Fitz, Jude and Narnie.When we read this part of the story, we’re not quite sure why their story forms part of the overall arc and at first, one is almost tempted to skim through this part because you don’t really see a point to this segment (which, by the way, is told in the form of manuscript pieces intertwined throughout the novel).It turns out though, that these 5 people have more history with the Jellicoe Road than we could have imagined.Their story is one that is filled with laughter and happiness, devastating tragedy and bittersweet nostalgia. Narnie and her troop are all made so real to us, and even though a few of them are no longer around, you can’t help but feel as if their presence is deeply soaked into the story.I wish I could tell you how the story comes together, but that is an epiphany – an “oh, that’s why” moment that every person should have the privilege of experiencing on their own.On the Jellicoe is also a novel that deals with so many difficult topics.Tackling issues of abandonment, suicide and bereavement, it’s a no-holds barred look at how the devastating actions and bad decisions of the past, impact Taylor and the various characters in this novel, in the most haunting manner possible.The secondary characters are incredible in their own way, and only enhance the sheer beauty of this novel.From the budding friendship and romance between rival gangs and watching how beautifully it comes together, we get to see how each character, despite appearances have an underlying yearning for something so much more than the circumstances they find themselves in.The relationship between Taylor and Jonah is definitely one of my favourites in YA. Watching how mistrust slowly fades away and brings them to a point where they become each other’s support, is nothing short of spellbinding.What’s even better is that these two have a chemistry that’s not just based on physical attraction, but also on a heartfelt emotional connection.At the end of the day though, On the Jellicoe Road is not just a story about love, friendship and learning to discover who and what you are, it’s also a story of how the actions of one generation can have far-reaching consequences on the ones they’ve left behind.It’s a moving and beautiful read filled with love, loss, laughter, heartache and the power of friendship and forgiveness. Above all, it’s a book that will make your soul weep with ALL the feelings your heart can stand.Give this one a chance. It’s more than earned its place on my list of all-time favourite reads.",4,default,"['young-adult', 'romance', 'contemporary-fiction', 'break-your-heart-reads', 'favorites', 'favourite-heroines', 'aussie-ya-authors', 'book-boys-i-love', 'brave-bold-gutsy-heroines']"

""Some people say their prayers at night. I don't. What I say is always the same. My name is Taylor Markham. I live on the Jellicoe Road.""
 I can honestly say I did not expect such an intricate and beautifully written story. I have book pals who've raved about this author and this book. Of course they recommended it to me and in typical reader fashion, I put it on the back burner with my Mt. TBR *smh*. I finally see why this book is often referenced and brought up again and again on my book feeds. There is a reason Jellicoe Road won an award, people!!Jellicoe Road tells the story about our heroine, Taylor Markham and essentially the significance of the book's title. [Side note: do you ever get happy chills when you come to understand why the title is what it is?? No? Just me?] I was SO confused as to what was going on in the first couple of chapters. I honestly didn't understand the hype. Once I hit chapter 16, my brain was on fire and it was non-stop MUST read each night! I continually spammed my friend Lisa at Romances Ever After with theories and all caps. I should really start keeping my chat receipts to show you my distress, theories and excitement while reading. There were a lot of emotions being thrown around in there. Anywho, back to the review~ There are a number of characters introduced that I found difficult to wrap my head around who was who all the time. The story weaves together the past and the present. The kicker was, the past was not Taylor's but of a different group of kids. I must admit that there came a point where I wrote down names and connection/relationship lines. The most obvious of these was the one between Taylor and Jonah Griggs. Jonah kind of grows on you. At least he did for me. At first, I just kept thinking ""this guy is mean!"", ""whatchu doing Tay?"", ""the Ben guy is much nerdier and cuter, go for Ben!"". Then Jonah starts dropping these smooth lines, being a caring individual and suddenly I'm a sucker for him. I came to care for many of the secondary characters as well: i.e. Santangelo. This precious pushover *sigh*. I wouldn't have mind learning more about him or even getting his own book because I felt vibes between him and another character! Also one for Hannah and the other person too please. Their backstory and history together hurt my heart so much.I think my favorite part of reading Jellicoe Road was trying to make connections to figure out what was happening. I was on detective mode, trying to solve the ""mystery"" of the story. There were some aspects that I was able to figure out with major determination and investigative skills. Other parts were very unexpected. My mind was blown on countless occasions! I highly recommend this book to all readers. I am officially a fan and happily riding this Marchetta train.",4,default,"['amazing-characters', 'brotps', 'contemporary', 'enemies-to-lovers', 'young-adult', 'tear-jerker', 'read-2019']"

That's my favorite adjective and I always use it to describe the books that I really love. But even that is such an understatement. This is so great, so wonderful that I can't even put it into words.Seriously. Like overflowing tears of happiness.
Plot
I'll go on without summarizing the plot. I'll tell you that even though the plot of On the Jellicoe Road may sound typical, it's the narration that changes it all. But really, I love everything about this book. I love the Houses all those rules in it and the Cadets and all that, it can very confusing at first but when you eventually understand it. I'll just warn you though that if you do read this book then great patience and understanding is required. Although the plot is pretty simple, it's the narration too that makes it all jumbled up. So you have to figure it out yourself to fully grasped everything. And I guess that's also one of the reasons I love this book, it makes the reader think. Really think. It's wonderful. It's amazing.
Characters
Taylor's character? I freaking love her. You know she's just a regular teenage girl. Yet, she's fierce. Tough. Not a perfect leader but a good now. She's what, seventeen? But acts like she's older than that. Her voice is so real, so alive that I feel like she's talking to me while I read this. I love everything about her. I love that she's responsible, I love that she gets annoyed, I love that she talks about her weakness and what she misses, I love how she puts on a brave face, I love how she handles situation, I just love her. Everything about her. She ain't no superwoman, but she's like a hero to me. I don't know why but it's like she inspires me.Jonah's character is wow. He looks dangerous in the outside but he's a total gentleman in the inside. Who would not melt reading about Jonah? Like so kilig!I love Jonah and Taylor interact. There's tension but there's also that sweetness. It's adorable and so so good to read. That bittersweet love!I love the other characters as well, even the characters in Hannah's story. They're all beautiful and so interesting to read.
Romance
I am a certified Taylor and Jonah fan! I mean, how can one not be? It's so fun to read about their conversations and their interactions. Their romance is not way over the top but the reader can really feel the connection.(view spoiler)[They didn't even said I love you to each other yet you can feel that they REALLY do love each other! (hide spoiler)]This romance that is that physically active but more emotionally active is a romance that I probably won't ever forget. It makes me think that you know words don't need to be said for you to understand, it's all about making the person feel it without saying it. And that I think is what makes Jonah and Taylor such a wonderful couple. Plus, this is also a mature couple. Yet there's also playfulness in them.
Narration and Writing
This two are probably the most amazing thing in this book. Taylor's narration is hands down, brilliant. It's alive, it's real. Her voice, it's like I can actually hear it. The way she narrates the book is so beautiful. I feel like I am part of the book and I'm in the book. And when I put down the book it's like waking up from a dream you know? Corny but true. It's complicated but when you finally get it, you'll be surprised how wonderful it is. I mean at first I was like ""huh?"" too but Marchetta's writing is so effective that well you'll be like ""oh my gosh, this is awesome!"" I enjoyed every part of this book, especially Taylor's voice. I feel like this by the overwhelming beauty of this book.The writing is also magnificent. It's detailed and it's confusing in such a good way that it will eventually make sense in the end. I love how she describes Taylor's emotions, her hardships, her happiness, her pain, her sorrow and just everything about it is so real. Like I can also actually feel it. I can connect so well with Taylor because of the writing and narration. And here I am again, frustrated that I can't express how wonderful it is. *sigh*I would really love to read more of Melina Marchetta's book, and really before reading this book I heard lots of good things already. I should've read it sooner! This is such a wonderful experience to be reading this book. Such a wonderful experience.",4,default,"['library-books', 'fell-in-love-with', 'made-me-cry', 'fangirl-for']"

And I don't know how to give a teaser summary without spoiling anything but I'll try to base on the synopsis on Goodreads. To make it short and simple, this is a story of 
  Taylor Markham
, a 17-year old senior student in a boarding school near Jellicoe Road who was abandoned by her mother when she was 11. Another one-sentence summary: This is a story a girl so broken, that all she knows about herself is fragments. The pieces, some are not clear, some a little odd or unnatural that it seems that they're not connected at all.Also this one is told in two perspectives: present and past, making it even more confusing. At least at first. I'm not gonna even suggest that you guys read this. YOUR CHOICE. Why? because even I who loves mysteries ever since I was a young girl got confused and almost give this one up. The first half of the book seemed to be really confusing and boring, though I somehow figured it out even before I reached 50%. But if you ever pick this one up and find yourself bored and confused as hell, DON'T GIVE UP.It's amazing how the author successfully weaved all the pieces together until they become one. Taylor's mother dumping her, a woman named Hannah keeping her from then on and now left her too without even saying goodbye, the five mysterious teenagers who once lived on the Jellicoe Road even before Taylor was born, the boy who visits in her dream to listen to her stories, the Hermit who whispered something in her before killing himself, the Brigadier who everytime in town, some people are missing and even the territory wars between Taylor's school partakes in. The connection between all these is superb. It was so well-written that it's like every piece of the story is a puzzle piece and one you got the hints, and then solve them as a whole eventually, it was glorious. Also haunting and heartbreaking. And did I mention, it's brilliant?The author even handled the characters so well, the emotions this book left me are just TOO MUCH.And this is only possible if I get connected with the characters I feel them. Some might say that this story isn't just about Taylor and they're maybe right. You see there's Hannah and the Brigadier. There's the five teenagers who once lived on Jellicoe road years ago who call themselves the fucked-up Five. There's the townies and the Cadets who are the other participants in the aforementioned territory wars which seemed childish, by the way, but really it is a part of the mystery. Anyway, there's also Raffy and Chaz. There's Ben  and Jessa.And there's 
  Jonah Griggs
, the boy who Taylor knows as the one who betrayed her. But then she has no choice but to face him. I love the chemistry between all the characters but Jonah and Taylor's exceeds my love to other YA couples. And Jonah just added to my list of book boyfriends. And Taylor, my heart bled for her.Darn it, my heart bled even for those five mysterious teenagers. This is really such an emotional but satisfying story that I know will stay in my heart forever. This one actually just made it to the books I'll reread forever. No kidding. Because you see no matter how emotional I get by reading this, it's all in a good way. It's worth it. It didn't leave me unsatisfied, but actually hopeful.

    WARNING: 
  
  this book contains some issues that others may find as triggers, so beware. But hey, you guys know how I'm dealing with depression now, still I read this book, I handled it well and loved it. Like I said, it left me hopeful. So high-five to that.

It happened of the Jellicoe Road. The prettiest road I'd ever seen, where trees made breezy canopies like a tunnel to Shangri-La. We were going to the ocean, hundreds of kilometres away, because I wanted to see the ocean and my father said that it was about the time the four of us made that journey. I remember asking, ""What's the difference between a trip and a journey?"" and my father said, ""Narnie, my love, when we get there, you'll understand,"" and that was the last thing he ever said. 
I did a little bit of reminiscing last night, and picked this book up as it is one of my favourites. Melina Marchetta is hands down one of my favourite authors. I had first heard of her at school when we studied her book ""Looking for Alibrandi"" an easily relatable book that deals with a girl struggling to find her identity. My sister recommended this book of Marchetta's claiming that it was worth the read. She said not to be worried if you did not understand it at first, but to wait for it to all make sense because the wait was worth it.. and she was most definitely right. I will say the first time I read the book, I was not at all confused as to where it was going because my sister had given me an all-too-in-depth explanation of the entire book and what to look out for, and I'm glad she did. I can completely understand where people are coming from in finding the first part of the book a drag as the past and present stories seem to be utterly separate and the characters different. However, persevere is the word I would use for this book. The heartfelt content that will make your heart warm and break is worth your frustration. Some people do not like the way the book is worded, but I find that's what makes Marchetta in a league of her own. She does not give you a typical YA book that deals with ""twilight"" topics but instead brings you on a real, raw journey of families that were affected by their time ""On the Jellicoe Road"" and how all of their lives intertwined. It's not meant to be a book that should be easy to understand or read, it let's the reader make up their assumptions, and in a way it really gives reader credit in saying that they are not ""dumb"" but can figure it out on their own without constant help along the way. 
I feel arms around my chest, a mouth against my ear whispering . . . whispering . . . Jonah Griggs whispering . . . ""Just breathe, just breathe, come on Taylor, just breathe . . . just breathe.""
Reread this book is the advice I would give, I've reread it a million times, and am still finding parts of the story I did not find along the way.
""Forgive me, please. Please. Please. Please. Please."" The words were pouring out of him, soaked with tears and phlegm and spit and blood, as she continued rocking him, while Jude held onto them both. And at that moment Jude thought something that he would never forgive himself for. He wished that he had never met any of them. 
This book is about identity, about belonging, about the bonds of friendship, the struggles and healing power of love, the way guilt can change a person's life, how hope is never lost and the importance of camaraderie. 
""What are you so sad about?"" Santangelo says to me. ""We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.""
The interwoven stories from the past really add a depth to the book and allows comparisons between the friends of the past with the friends of the present. It shows the deterioration of one group and the coming together of another. Each character has their flaws, yet each character made me fall completely in love with them. I really love that this book showed that there is no clear distinction between a character that is bad or good, but that sometimes it is not their choice how they are perceived regardless of who they truly are. It shows how people who are lost, can be found.
 A home to come back to every day of their lives. Where they would all belong or long to be.A place on the Jellicoe Road.

I want to gush and use words like beautiful and poignant and heart-wrenching, but they don't even come close to describing the depth of emotions I'm drowning in right now.You know how there are books you want to keep a closely guarded secret because you know - you just know - it would kill a part of you if somebody didn't appreciate it as much? And then there are those books that restore your faith in humanity and are so real and honest that you want to cry because such a thing exists and you're frustrated that it took you so long to find it and you're just downright giddy with happiness because reading them does something to you and you suddenly want to make changes in your life because you haven't been living the way you always dreamed you would and you want to share it with the world so that they can feel the same way?That's what Jellicoe Road is - a gift to the world. I'm not talking about its literary merit here, although Marchetta's writing by itself is astounding. I'm talking about it being a tiny voice contained in these 300 pages telling you to be the kind of person you've always wished you were. That little voice that gets lost in our constant rush to get somewhere. We have moments - I know I do - when we just take a step back from whatever we're ""supposed"" to be doing at the time and ask ourselves just where the hell we're going with our lives. And then it's gone. It's back to finishing assignments, studying for exams, working.Not living.You know what I want to do?I want to write this book on my walls. I want to stare at it everyday and remind myself of what is important to me. I want to wake up to Marchetta's unbelievable ability to say exactly what I wish I could say to myself sometimes, and to say it in a way that is just.. right. Wake up to her ability to create characters that make me howl with laughter and sob hysterically in equal measures. I want to read every book she's ever written and carry them with me everywhere I go, because just knowing they are there for me, should I need them, is comforting.I want to change the summary of this book on Goodreads, because it doesn't come close to even being in the same continent of what this book is about.I want to praise Melina Marchetta to the skies for creating secondary characters that aren't just accessories, but are as vividly alive as the main ones. I want to point at Taylor Markham and tell whoever is willing to listen, ""THAT. That is how you create female YA characters."" I desperately want to be able to stay separate from all the Jonah Griggs-love that is floating around on Tumblr (I'm failing miserably).I want to flood this review with quotes from the book, just to show you how lyrical and soul-shattering her writing is, but I really really think I'd be taking something away from you if I did. Her words deserve to be consumed with full knowledge of all that came before it because only then will it resonate as strongly as it should.I want to buy a thousand copies of this book and go up to every human being I know and thrust this at them with the hugest smile on my face and ask them to read it. And most importantly, I want to thank Raya with everything I've got for introducing me to such a wonderful author.",4,default,"['2013', 'favourites', 'hearteyes', 'stayed-up-all-night', 'favourite-characters', 'cried-my-eyes-out', 'couldnt-stop-laughing', 'beyond-5-stars', 'just-stab-me-while-you-re-at-it', '2015']"

Taylor has suddenly found herself with a lot of responsibility, none of which she wants: she is head of her House at the school and is expected to pay attention to the younger girls, and she has been named leader of the school during their annual territory war with the local Townies and a group of prep school boys from Sydney called the Cadets, who come camp out on the Jellicoe Road every year for six weeks from September into October. Making life even more complicated, the leader of the Cadets this year is a boy named Jonah Griggs with whom Taylor has some ""history."" And Hannah, the only adult with whom Taylor has any real connection, suddenly disappears, leaving Taylor both grappling with her abandonment issues and filled with new questions about her mother. A parallel story is woven through the book, taken from a novel Hannah has been writing about 3 teenagers named Narnie, Webb, and Tate, who were brought together by a horrible car accident on the Jellicoe Road, which Taylor reads during Hannah's absence. This book opens with the words ""My father took 132 minutes to die. I counted."" So you might guess that it is not the most cheerful story around. Really terrible things have happened to the characters -- and yet, since they happened in the past, it didn't bother me as much as in other books I've read. Taylor, the 17-year-old narrator, is numb, but has a tough attitude that kept the story from feeling whiny or annoying. Plus, the way it's told is like a jigsaw puzzle. It's hard to tell what's going on for the first 100 pages or so, but hints and clues are tossed out in a way that kept me glued to the book -- I could hardly put it down. I did have to keep flipping back to double-check what I had already read, though, which was a little annoying. This is not an easy read, but it is completely absorbing. There's an intensity to the story that kept it living in my head every time I had to put it aside.I really enjoyed reading this book, and was completely blown away by it. The only minus I can call out is a bit of plot overkill at the very end, but the story nevertheless succeeded in ripping my heart out, stomping all over it, and putting it back together again. This is one of the very rare books where, after I finished it, I flipped straight back to the beginning and started it again. I think it's just an amazing achievement. This was the winner of the 2009 Printz Award, and totally deserved it. ",4,default,"['beautifully-written', 'just-brilliant']"

I don’t know if my review will manage to contribute to the praise it had received from others, and I really want to, so here I go.Taylor - the lead character and the narrator of the present time story – is a 17 years old girl abandoned by her mother, six years ago, at a Seven-Eleven. Fearing being abandoned again, she tries to keep away from deeper relationships with people while craving such connection at the same time. One day, Hannah, her closest person disappears and Taylor has no choice but to ask for help so she can find her.There is a past time story going on parallel to Taylor’s and I think it’s best to go into this book without knowing anything about it because as it unfolds page by page is exactly how the magic of this book happens. It’s true that the first 100 pages or so of On the Jellicoe Road are not easy to get through but once I understood the two parallel stories and their connection, that didn’t matter at all, I was completely engrossed. Honestly, I don’t remember the last time I’ve read a book that made me care so much for every single character. The story is complex and multi-layered, with many characters, and I ended up loving all of it. Also, I ended up in tears more than once, and I have to say - the final chapters are devastating. Yes, it’s a heartbreaking and emotional book but in no way melodramatic. On the contrary, the characters are realistic and the emotions they go through are raw, and that only makes the book more powerful. And yes, I could feel the sadness and grief pouring from the pages but there is also so much love, forgiveness, humour and wit. And everything you could want from a book. So wonderful.I have read Saving Francesca and The Piper's Son and I loved them both, but On the Jellicoe Road is my favourite Melina Marchetta book so far. Read it, it’s an unforgettable experience.

More like eleventy bajillion squillion stars. I love this book so much. Sosososo much.My review, originally posted here www.thetometravellers.wordpress.comI’m just going to come out and say that I have absolutely no idea how to put into words the complete and total love I have for this book. I think I’m just going to start typing and I’ll hopefully produce something meaningful.Firstly, I have to give a special shout-out to my dear friend Emily for bringing this book into my life. It was the second book of MM’s I read (in 2009) and the one that sold me on her so who knows if I would’ve ever read it, if not for her? Sometimes, when I’m a contemplative mood, I think about what my life would’ve been like had I not read it. Plodding along like I do, blissfully ignorant of this amazing book. So thank you, Emily.Secondly, I’m going to be honest and admit that it took me months to read it, because of the confusing start, and if not for Emily nagging me, I would’ve taken longer. I distinctly remember the day I made the decision to just finish it once and for all, because I was sick of having it on my bedside table. I picked it up again after firmly telling myself not to bitch out this time and that night, after passing the half way mark where things start making more sense, I finished it. And then I sat on my bed, thought about it for a while, flicked through it again and started bawling my eyes out. And so my love affair with On The Jellicoe Road began.Here’s some dot points on the things that I love about Jellicoe, because I can tell I’m going to start rambling soon if I don’t provide some sort of structure to this post:- It has one of the – actually no; probably THE most intriguing introductions I’ve ever read. Not that I can say this for myself, as I’ve already confessed it took me a while to read it originally, but from the numerous re-reads since then, it reels me in like no other introduction ever has, despite already being familiar with the story.- The plot: the intricacies of the two intertwining storylines, while initially confusing, is such a brilliant concept and it adds an air of mystery to the story, which I love.- The inclusion of lyrics from one of my favourite songs: Flame Trees by Cold Chisel.- The power of the feels: the way it makes my heart hurt, my eyes leak and my toes curl in a way few other books do.So there you go. I did try, but no words will ever be enough to accurately describe my feelings about this book. It is just… *sighs*",4,default,"['favourites', 'this-i-love', 'livin-in-the-land-down-under', 'ouch-my-heart', 'teenage-childhood-years', '2014-reads', '2012-reads', '2016-reads', '2018-reads', '2009-reads']"

Dang. Somehow I feel like I should be above the opinion of everyone else, and yet everyone else keeps being right. Now I sound like I think I'm superior. I don't think that. I just... Aw, heck. I don't know. I quit. I started Jellicoe Road being confused, which seems to be a common sentiment. I read the Prologue and was like, ""Oh. Interesting."" Then I started reading about these other people who had seemingly no connection to the prologue, other than the road name. Clue #1 that I was in for a confusing read.Clue #2 was that Taylor didn't know her dad/her mom abandoned her. I've come to learn that if any kind of deal is made out of this, we will be searching for them in some form, which leads to a confused Rachel. Clue #3 was this mysterious trip to Yass with a Cadet that kept being mentioned. Clue #4 was the war between the Jellicoe students, Cadets, and Townies. I don't get war. (This concludes my clue list, I promise.)It took me a good hundred pages to really get into Jellicoe Road, but when it happened, boy did it hook me. Once I had my bearings, Melina Marchetta certainly took me on a ride. She had me hooked, and I was her slave until I understood everything. Now, I don't give away storylines, because that would utterly ruin the book.Taylor is an utterly wonderful protagonist. She is exactly what I've come to expect from Melina Marchetta. She's strong-willed and tough, but hurting on the inside, just waiting for someone to unlock that part of her and be willing to listen. She's innately a good person, but rough around the edges and definitely has her flaws. And ohhhhhhhh Jonah. I really didn't think I was going to like him, until we met him. He's definitely my kind of lurveee interest. He's tough and manly, but protective and loving. :) :) :) :) :) He didn't fail to make me smile and/or swoon.As I've said before, I'm not really a big mystery fan, but this felt different. It didn't have the same danger, I guess, that most mysteries have. There was a distinct urgency to it, like if things weren't figured out quickly, there would be repercussions. This was quite true, but I didn't know it at the time.Most of what I can say is that Jellicoe Road is absolutely as good as everyone says it is and more. It's funny and poignant, joyful and tragic, magnificent and heart-breaking. If you're a fan of literally anything about books, it is absolutely worth your time.",4,default,[]

I read it for the first time a couple of years ago and just recently read it again because I couldn’t quite help myself. I’m happy to say that absolutely nothing was lost in the reread. The emotional intensity and deeply felt sense of loss remained the same despite the fact that I know how the story weaves itself together.I know a lot of people who haven’t read the book get frustrated because all the reviews they read are so vague and mysterious. All I have to say to that is: Welcome to Jellicoe Road. The mystery that unfolds inside this story is incredibly deep and personal.I don’t really even know how to write a review without being ridiculously intense about the whole thing. I also feel like I should dig out a thesaurus so I don’t throw around the words “intense,” “powerful” and “emotional” too often. Because let me tell you, the book is all of those things.When you start reading the stories of the present day Taylor Markham along with the mysterious past narrations woven together by five friends – you’ll start out confused. Then, around half-way you’ll think “oh, I’ve got this figured out.” And sure, some of the pieces are easy to connect. But don’t think that doesn’t mean the story is without twists and turns – because you’re wrong. Also, don’t think that knowing how some of the pieces fit mean you won’t feel anything when the book finally brings them together. Because you’ll be wrong then too. No matter what you think you know, I can promise you at some point you will be affected. Heart broken. Mind blown.Also, no matter how many times it gets said, it deserves to be said again: Jonah Griggs is pretty much a god. He does have imperfections which are nicely highlighted, but it just makes him seem more real. Even though I normally scoff when high school aged relationships get too intense, I can say with no hesitation whatsoever that this is an exception.I would give a lot to see a sequel with these characters, but their story has been told. I don’t feel that there were any loose ends or pieces left unfinished. Darn shame. After creating these beautiful characters for us, the least Melina Marchetta could have done was give us a little more time with them.This book is definitely an experience y’all, and I could probably go on about it forever.

The Secret History, The Likeness, rereading Harry Potter (oh the Marauders!), and now On the Jellicoe Road. There is something so captivating about being pulled into the nuanced balanced of a friendship. For we get to see the intimacy, the connections, the interests, the quirks, the loves…the secrets…the slight wobble to the balance….and the pressure pressing on the thin cracks. For just as I care deeply about Taylor Markham in Jellicoe Road, I also care deeply about Tate, Narnie, Jude, Fitz, and Webb, a group of friends who meet amidst a devastating accident and whose story is slowly revealed throughout the course of the novel. Marchetta deftly unravels the story for us and we are piecing together this history alongside Taylor. I kept reading to get to the next glimpse into their lives (just as I would anticipate the next time I could go inside the pensieve and see the Marauders in action.) Each moment that's revealed is a short, weighty jewel. For those who have read it, all I have to say is ""Fitz and the tree"" and you know how skilled Marchetta is with weaving emotion into moments without becoming sappy or obvious. There are so many hints throughout the entire book, so if the beginning is confusing, wait, patient reader! For Marchetta is just showing you all the threads before she weaves them deftly together. While I was entranced by the Five, I also loved getting to know Taylor Markham. Marchetta has the ability to create flawed and hurting characters who are strong and vulnerable, which allows for insights into brokenness and healing. Taylor is struggling to figure out why events have happened in her life and she is seeking answers, desperately, and we are invited in on this personal adventure. And Jonah Griggs. He compliments and encourages and builds a friendship with Taylor that strengthens them both. While their relationship slowly develops, it does not completely take over the story. Also, the author's depiction of Jellicoe Road and the Australian bush are gorgeous. I love when I feel like I get to travel to a place through the words an author skillfully paints.

""On the Jellicoe Road"" deserves every star and every accolade it's received in my opinion, and even as this is my first Marchetta read, I hope to read more of her works to come. This is a heart-wrenching novel; it's hard not to feel for each of the characters that are presented here. You feel every ounce of pain, relief, triumph and failure between each of the characters, and Marchetta captures emotion very well in the course of the story. I'm glad that I took the recommendation given to me to read it.Don't get me wrong, when I say that the first 100 or so pages are hard to get through - they are. There are many characters to keep track of, at least two storylines that seem to occur at once, and many threads strewn along each of those individual stories. I'll admit I actually stopped and started this novel a few times. For the patient reader, however, whether they're an elder teen or adult, the payoff is huge - it comes together beautifully. Ultimately the storylines merge in a potent display of emotion, history, and self-discovery. 17-year-old Taylor Markham is the center of it all. After her mother abandons her at a 7-11 when she's only 11, Taylor finds herself taken under the wing of Hannah, and attends the Jellicoe Road school nearby. But when Hannah disappears unexpectedly, leaving Taylor in charge of the younger students in her house and dealing with a turf war, she realizes that she must face aspects of her past as well as the story that Hannah has written and left behind in order to find the key to her future, and being able to move on from some tramuatizing events. I'll admit that I cried in a few places within the novel, because the pain Taylor feels with discovering the truths and unearthing things about her past that she would rather not think about are vivid and very real. Another thing I enjoyed about the novel was watching the steadily growing relationship between Taylor and Jonah Griggs - it feels vivid, realistic, and plausible, and I couldn't help but love the way their characters interacted, even through the moments where they clashed and took into account their difficult history with each other.Honestly one of the best novels I've read in recent years, not just in the young adult category, but among any genre.

I don't even know where to start in a review of this fabulous book. It was so emotionally potent; I can't even begin to describe the power it held over me, a power that I can only assume would be just as significant for any reader.Taylor Markham, like so many characters in literature, is trying so desperately to discover herself and her past. She is piecing together bits and pieces of past experiences of not only her own, but of the children who once lived at Jellicoe Road years before. She is trying to find out who she really is, what her purpose may be, and where her roots derive from. Her progress at first feels a little tedious, but by the end you are immersed and on board with every single decision and discovery she makes.Jonah, is without a doubt a truly swoonworthy character. On some level, I wish he was developed a bit more, or at least on a similar level to some of the side characters from Jellicoe's past, but that does not discount the development and value he did have. That is what is so amazing about Melina Marchetta. You may not get everything you want, but you can't help but feel so much confidence in her inherent skill as a writer that you know she wanted to you to think that extra step, wishing to know more about a character, and knowing that you know enough to make him or her truly remarkable. Melina Marchetta, once again weaves a fabulously enriched story that may start out a little slow, but builds so gradually and with such subtly that by the end, when it finally truly slams into you, you can't help but feel for every character involved. From Taylor, to Jonah, Narnie, Webb, Tate, Jude, and even Jessa, you feel each progressive emotional impact like a personal hit to the soul. Like I said it starts slowly, but once you meet a character revelation, I, at least, was overwhelmed with such deep seated feeling, and it didn't stop there. It continued and built until the very last word of the very last sentence of the very last page. I was almost inconsolable with tears that borderlined between absolute tragic desolation and uninhibited joy. I can't believe it took me so long to finally pick up this book, but I am so very happy I did. ",4,default,['favorites']

My words lost along the pages. It messed my head and my heart. I don't think I need to describe how awesome this book is. You can read it from other reviews. This is mostly about my thought and feeling after I read it.It started with an unconvincing story, at least for me. The prologue was good. It has mystery vibe that made me wanted to enter chapter one immediately. But then I had trouble, big one, in first third chapters. I was overwhelmed with all those names and things that happened at the same time. And they felt like they didn't connect with each other, though I know that they must be connected. Long story short, I was frustrated and confused.As my friends said it is indeed confusing but it was worth it. So I reread first three chapters slowly and tried to absorb it. They were right, it got better for me and I can see the story clearer this time.The thing is there are three different stories in this book; the prologue story, about five students; the main character’s, Taylor Markhman, story and a story about her dream. So you see? Even her dream makes an interesting story.They intertwine each other. What seems didn't have connection in the beginning slowly make a dot along the way. It made me easier to connect those dots but when it truly happened I wished it happen differently, because it was so sad it broke my heart. It didn't mean that it's predictable, though. There are surprises that I think will leave you speechless.At the end of the page, I can assure you that it was so worth it. The confused, the anger, the sadness were worth it. And when you feel all those feeling, don't stop. Just hang in there like Taylor hangs in on her memory to reveal her true identity, because that way you'll find an amazing story that will linger, no matter how hurtful the story is.*picture from http://couldveshapedheartaches.tumblr.",4,default,"['bully-abuse-dysfunctional-family', 'contemporary', 'ebook', 'favorite', 'romance']"

Her ability to paint an emotional picture is what makes this book so remarkable. She doesn’t even describe what most of the characters look like; no “grey eyes and lush brown hair” like every other book I read because she doesn’t need those details. She paints her characters by who they are on the inside, who they are in their deepest sense. This book takes its readers on an emotional journey filled with great mystery, so much mystery that I really had no idea what was going on for the first 30% of the book. There are many characters and a slowly intricate weaving of their life stories, complete with tragedy, great love and laughter, desperation and self-discovery. Incredible. It was well worth the wait of slogging through the confusion in the beginning of the book.Despite all of the tragedy, this really is a story of hope. No matter what happens, there is always a way to pick up the pieces. The bonds of friendship and love are so powerful, even when one tries to run away from them.""What are you so sad about?"" Santangelo says to me. ""We're going to know him for the rest of our lives.""(view spoiler)[

What happens when she's not around to tell me about his belt leaving scars across my two-year-old brother's face or when he whacked her so hard that she lost her hearing for a week?

I'd give this ten. I want to buy copies of this and give it to everyone I know. Be warned. This book will make you cry. I sat rocking back and forth sobbing as I reached the end. Melina Marchetta is simply one of the most gifted writers ever. She writes so wonderfully of things like grief and loss that it tears your heart out. Her characters are so well developed and real, you grow to care so much for them through the course of the novel and by the end you are a sobbing wreck of a human being...red-nosed and sniffling. Awesome.This book tells the story of Taylor Markham, aged seventeen. She was abandoned by her drug addicted mother at age eleven and rescued from the Seven-Eleven by Hannah. She attends the Jellicoe school, a boarding school where she is head of her house. She is in the middle of planning The War which is a yearly occurrence between kids at the Jellicoe School, the Townies and the Cadets, who come back year after year to camp in the woods near the school. Hannah has disappeared, the only adult Taylor trusts and she is desperate to find out what happened to her. I diddid find the first seventy or so pages a bit confusing as Taylor's story is mixed up with the story of five teenagers who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen years ago, named Narnie, Tate, Webb, Fitz and Jude. Taylor also has dreams of a boy with no name up in a tree which adds a bit to the confusion. Now that I have finished the book and I know all I wonder why I was baffled by this. I actually started reading this in June. I put it down because I found it so confusing. I picked it up this morning determined to give it another go. I'm so glad I did. I finished it in a few short hours and cried my eyes out. It makes cranky that not everyone has read this book. Melina Marchetta should be a gazillionaire. And I'm eternally grateful to Goodreads as I never would have heard of this book or this wonderful author if I hadn't joined.

I didn't cry but there were many points that I had to put the book down to process or work past something. I love getting to react like that.watching things start to fit is incredible. with any other writer this could feel contrived and way too much of a stretch, but there are very specific connecting points and so many things that happen that rely on these people being the people that they are, and it's fantastic. and as thick as this gets (especially compared to her other non-fantasy books) the core of it is (like, again, all of her other books), these kids and their relationships with each other. misc. things - because I don't want to say much more - I really loved the two main stories here, and I love that Marchetta tells stories about friendships and love that form foundations and homes, things that stick to you and can break you and fundamentally change you. there's a caring for these people from these people that I adore. and you can tell this story's written between Francesca and Finnikin, I think; she shifts away a lot from explicitly-said love, plainly-said feelings, and there's a lot of little things I loved catching on my own. the last line of the book (pre-epilogue) against the last line of the prologue made me put my book away so I could wail. also! it took me a while to understand what exactly the set-up of this story was, and I LOVE IT when authors let me fumble around for a while. she did the same with Finnikin, it makes me so happy.

Well-written and heart-wrenching and honest and engaging, I can honestly see why so many people love it. The story was a bit confusing at the beginning, the pace sometimes slowed to a crawl and sometimes I got annoyed at how deliberately vague the author was, but I really, really liked it and strongly recommend it. I really look forward to reading more things by this author. At first, I had given this book 4 stars. Then I gave it 5. Then I went back and left it at 4 for a couple of days. And finally, after much debate, I decided to give it 5 stars based on one thing alone: I can't get it out of my head. I might just happen to catch a glance of it on my bookshelf as I leave my room or I might even be reading another book or browsing titles to buy next, but Jellicoe Road is lodged inside my head and, when it decides to let itself be known in there, it takes up all of my attention and I can't help thinking of it fondly. I loved the relationship between Taylor and Johna, their interactions and the chemistry between them. I loved Taylor's development and I absolutely adored the way the her story entwined with the other one been told. You might see the plot twits coming from a mile away, but it speaks very highly of a book and an author when seeing the twist from a mile away does not in any way ruin the reading experience, the quality of the story or your overall impression of it. This story is one of self-discovery and self-appreciation, of forgiveness and understanding and I truly believe the author did a marvelous job presenting them and making the reader live them through the characters. This is really a marvelous book and one I don't expect to forget about any time soon.

Gracias por recomendarlo. Se que ella me ha dicho que no iba a entender nada al principio... efectivamente, no he entendido nada, pero igual al seguir leyendo uno va entendiendo. Al igual que lucia creo que este libro debe ser leído sin saber mucho de él por que no es lo que esperas. Realmente te deja marcada y esto e por todas las verdades impactantes que ocurren el libro, eso se debe tener muy claro, puesto que este libro no consiste en muchos plot twist, sino mas bien en unir que pasa en las historias que se cuentan y se van uniendo y las verdades impactantes que se dan en el libro.Mi puntuación le he dado un 5 de 5 como se ha visto, pero le daría en realidad un 4, 6 o 4.7 y esto es por que a pesar de lo mucho que me ha encantado lo últimos 5 o 6 caps se me hicieron muy novela de tv no se por que, pero podía escuchar una de esas canciones al final de una telenovela con satisfacción de que todo (como sea que haya salido) saldrá bien por el resto dela vida de los personajes.Ame a cada uno de los personajes,creo que cada uno tiene su esencia y no les cambiaría nada.Un consejo, si lo lees con atención te darás cuenta muy rápido de mas o menos todo aunque con algunas intrigas.Confieso que tuve mucho momento fangirl y que he tenido mini paros cardíacos por el libro.

And it has undone me, completely. And not just because it is bittersweet and heartbreaking, but because it so life affirming. A beautiful story of family, friendship, redemption, forgiveness and hope.The characters...all of them compelling. Taylor and Jonah. What can I say: I could read their scenes for hours.There's beautiful writing, a breathtaking sense of place (in the bush and the city), sharp dialogue and a page-turning mystery about what's really going on.The story unfolds in rich layers - much like the characters. The reveals when they come are not so much bombshells as inevitable connections. And in the end, it's not the twists that are compelling, but the way the characters respond to them.Since finishing this book a few hours ago, I've read some stunning reviews here on Goodreads, so I know there's nothing I can add to describe the power and brilliance of this book.I borrowed my copy from the library.

She's really good.This book takes a lot of getting used to. If you're having a hard time reading it, my advice is to just wait it out. Get past the first 100 pages, and I promise it'll all be worth it.This is the kind of book that keeps you up at five in the morning, just begging to be finished. It doesn't care that you need to get up early in the morning. It doesn't care that you need to entertain guests the next day and that, maybe, you don't want circles under your eyes that are darker than the inside of a Hollister. Absolutely no consideration from this book. Zero. Nada. Nill. Jellicoe Road is captivating, enigmatic, beautiful, and so very tragic. It's well-written and fascinating, with three-dimensional characters that will make you happy, sad, and everything else in between. I'm a little worried that it won't fly with its target audience since Melina Marchetta isn't exactly household name, but let it be known that this is probably the best YA contemporary I've ever read.

I had more tears in my eyes the second time around... It's a beautiful and heartbreaking tale of friendship and love, that's all I am going to say. I have a problem though with this book being labelled as young adult, which does it a disservice and limits its audience...

(Yay!)The story very much resembles a jigsaw puzzle and the author doesn’t really wrap everything up in a neat bow at the end. It took me a lot of back and forth to fit all the pieces and answer all of the relevant questions and it was a complete treat.The serial killer arc was hilarious (only when it wasn’t - Jeez 😟🤯) And my favourite characters ? well of course Ben and Santangelo!

It was a fantastic read. It took a little bit of time to get going and figure out what was going on, but once it got going, it really got going. I LOVED all the characters in this book, especially our H/h Taylor and Jonah. But then again, there are actually more heroes and heroines in this book. There's actually two stories going on, but they are all connected to each other. This story had me smiling, shocked, and on the verge of tears. Excellent, excellent read!

Mellyberry,/user/show/7558779-e-mellyberry,"As usual with Marchetta’s books, her first few chapters are always confusing. After The Piper’s Son, I’ve thrown myself into Jellicoe with all my heart and soul. I didn’t read the synopsis, so imagine the double headache when I was bombardized with jumping scenes and dozens of strange names. You have people’s names, Boarding houses’ names, and places. The only name I’ve recognized is Sydney.I’m kind of glad that Marchetta’s writing isn’t brutally choppy here. The sentence flows into one another, enough to make me feel like I’m dancing between them. But of course she had to chop something. This time it was the emotion. Did she write with an axe?She chopped scenes mercilessly while I was still salivating (or crying or gasping) all over them. The good thing is you don’t feel too overwhelmed with drama, but I found myself screaming for more. More words. More kissing, more territory wars, more tongue-lashing … more closure. Especially in scenes that involved Jude and Taylor and Griggs. I have broken fingernails to prove how much I craved for more in those scenes. 
Because being a part of him isn’t just anything. It’s kind of everything. “It’s actually because my heart belongs to someone else.”“You were wrong yesterday in the car, you know, “I tell him. “About how every time Hannah looks at you she’s wishing you were someone else. I think that every time she looks at you she’s scared you won’t come back, like the others.”He takes her hand and draws her to his side. They don’t say anything as the walk with me, but I’ve been here before, so I know that words aren’t needed. I remember love. “You can forgive all of them but you can’t forgive you and Jude for living.”“I’d forgive myself. To be with Jonah, I’d do anything.”“I’ll probably mention that I’m in love with you.”I go up to Hannah and Jude’s room and tell them that she’s dead, and I climb between them and I am raw inside.“I was there to throw myself in front of it.”“Just breathe, Just breathe, come on, Taylor, just breathe…just breathe.”
Taylor is the perfect example of a strong heroine. Raffy and Jessa add the kickass feel into it. I love Santangelo from the first moment his name was mentioned. That little shit. And I adore Ben, his violin, and his funny-sometimes-wounded personality. Because of how I feel toward Ben, I could never forgive Griggs for breaking Ben’s fingers. Seriously, Jonah, if you’re so desperate in getting Taylor’s attention, why don’t you break your own fingers? Though I couldn’t love Jonah fully, I ended up having a tiny weenie insignificant crush on him. He does clean up nicely after that. Okay. Maybe a bit more than tiny weenie. Jonah felt like a secondary character to me and that’s okay I think. With so many main characters in one book, I understand that Marchetta needed to focus on the original five and Taylor. In my opnion, this is the story of Taylor, Hannah, Jude and Webb. The rest are the pretty, colorful icing on the cupcake. I have successfully turned this book from all-about-Taylor to all-about-Jude. I’m hopeless that way. Gimme a suffering hero and I’m doomed. 
St. Jude was the patron saint of the impossible – lost and desperate causes. I think he hit the jackpot in that department when he met the Markhams and Schroeders.
Jude is my hero. He’s St. Jude, the hero of all heroes. I will arm-wrestle anyone who says otherwise. I couldn’t stop thinking about him, even as I write this review. I wonder how he looks like. Probably like Chris Evans? Imagine him in uniform. Is he Jude enough? Is he broken and suffering enough? Damn. I have no fingernails left to bite.I can’t help but picturing Hannah as the more mature Georgie (TPS). Whenever Hannah’s name came up in the book, I almost always skimmed the pages looking for words like Hannah, Jude, love, and happy in one sentence. I was disappointed most of the time. I know everyone will argue that it’s implied somewhere there, between the lines. I don’t care. I need to read the words, in one perfect sentence, with my own eyes. In print. Not implied. “Hannah reckons that if you ask her to marry you, she’ll say yes.”PROPOSE, JUDE. KISS HER, JUDE. GODAMN YOU, JUDE. DO SOMETHING!Jude’s moving in and he sleeps in Hannah’s room. WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE, JUDE?Tate and I bullied them into going away one weekend by stressing our need to have time alone together. OHMYGOOOOD! GENIUS, TAYLOR, GENIUS!There is one tiny weenie problem that take a half point away from its five stars. (Sorry...)The dreams. I got the impression that the author used the dream to explain the things that otherwise couldn’t be explained. Some sort of backstory. Or a closure. The dream is a metaphor for something bigger and greater than the characters themselves. Okay, I get it. I don’t mind dreams in general, but in Jellicoe, it dictates the story. I feel like I’m reading a half paranormal, half contemporary book. I'm okay with Taylor’s dreams, really I do. I was intrigued. But when Griggs mentioned his father came to him in a dream when they were on the train, I couldn’t help it. Yes. I rolled my eyes. When Tate told Taylor about Webb’s dream and how Taylor name came up - no. No. No. Please no. Come on, this is pushing it. I don’t find the epilogue that fascinating either. I was hoping to read an epilogue about Jude. About Taylor and Griggs. About all of them five, ten years from now. I want to read how happy they are, living under one roof, driving each other crazy with love. I want that. See what I mean by mercilessly choppy? My emotion is freaking raw and the book ends with Hannah saying “I wonder.” Heh? Did I buy the incomplete book? One of my GR friends asked me to compare Jellicoe to TFIOS. Seriously, girl, it makes me nervous. How to compare two great authors whose personality is as big as their characters? I only can tell by my own experience, okay. It may not be enough, but here we go.They both are emotional reads. These two authors manage to paint their heroes into swoon-worthy characters not by physical traits, but by strong personalities and their heart-breaking process of growing up. For me, that’s a huge plus.Okay? So… This is my last read, guys. I’ve wrapped up my 2013. How cool is it that I’m signing off with a stellar book like Jellicoe?I won't be picking up anymore books or ebooks till January :)I hope your last book that you read or write or blog in 2013 will be as memorable as mine. And I just hope that my kick-off read in January will be as awesome as this one. So, happy holiday, you all <3Be safe. Be merry.
